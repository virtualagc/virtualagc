    <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
    The home page of this website semi-jokingly suggests you might want
    to use our AGC+DSKY simulation software to create a <a
      href="index.html#..._Or_for_the_silly_mood_">clock app</a> for
    your computer or perhaps write <a
      href="index.html#..._Or_for_the_even_sillier_mood_">a calculator
      program or tic-tac-toe game</a> using it ... all without giving
    you any clues as to how to go about doing such a thing.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    It's true that we do have a <a href="developer.html">developer page</a>,
    which goes into seemingly-endless though still-incomplete detail
    about AGC software from a developer's point of view, but the
    developer page is really focused on software developers who might
    want to create simulations for Apollo peripherals devices such as
    the Alignment Optical Telescope (AOT) or the Inertial Measurement
    Unit (IMU) that aren't otherwise provided by our Virtual AGC
    Project.&nbsp; In other words, the developer page (and most of the
    remainder of this website) caters to people who are interested in
    simulating the historical Apollo missions or flying hypothetical
    Apollo missions as accurately as possible, and who want to enrich
    that experience by creating ever-more-faithful bits and pieces of
    the simulation.<br>
    <br>
    But what if you simply want to do something fun, but different, with
    the AGC+DSKY, perhaps outside the context of simulation within a
    spacecraft environment?&nbsp; For example, to display the current
    temperature, or GPS data, or as I already said, to make a calculator
    program?<br>
    <br>
    Well, there's a variety of ways to go about doing such stuff.&nbsp;
    For example, maybe you just want to display this stuff on the DSKY
    directly, and not even bother with the AGC at all.&nbsp; If so, I
    wish you luck, but am not sympathetic to your plight.&nbsp; The <i>correct</i>
    way to go about it, in my oh-so-not-humble opinion, is to write
    actual AGC software that does whatever you need done, and let the
    simulated AGC display whatever you need on the DSKY.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;
    That way, you not only end up with a clock or a calculator or a game
    or whatever, but you've also learned something about what it was
    like as an AGC programmer from the Apollo era, <i>and</i> have
    developed some AGC-programmer street-creds (as if there were such a
    thing).&nbsp; Now, <i>that's</i> a hobbyist project!<br>
    <br>
    This is a particularly apropos topic for anybody who has purchased a
    functional AGC+DSKY replica, such as <a
href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/DSKY-with-Integrated-AGC-runs-NASA-MIT-Code/263190750503?hash=item3d47642527:g:IwoAAOSw35lZePeX">one



      of those sold on eBay</a> by Sam Ammons.&nbsp; It's all very well
    that you now have a working AGC plus DSKY-lookalike that can run
    (say) the Apollo 11 LM AGC software, but you don't have a LM flying
    in space, do you?&nbsp; So what good does it do you (other than
    being immensely cool)?&nbsp; Naturally, you want to justify your
    purchase by making it do something <i>else</i> too, and to amaze
    your geekish friends!&nbsp; Well, making your own custom AGC
    software is a way to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the particular
    3D-printed DSKY mentioned happens to contain a Raspberry Pi running
    our very-own Virtual AGC software, we're actually in a good position
    to understand how to adapt custom AGC software to it, though you
    don't need that specific gadget to take advantage of the info
    provided on this page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Disclaimer:&nbsp; I did
    lend my sage advice and some software to the manufacturer of that
    device, which is why I know about it, but I derive no financial
    benefit from it.) <br>
    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
    <h2><a name="Basic_Facts"></a>Basic Facts</h2>
    At its heart, the AGC is simply a computer, like any other:&nbsp; It
    has memory which it can read to or write from for storing variables,
    it has memory that it can read from but not write to for storing its
    program, and it can execute simple instructions one after the other
    at a fixed "clock" rate.&nbsp; It has much less memory and a much
    slower clock speed and the instructions are different in detail from
    our modern-day computers, but the concept is the same.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, just being able to execute instructions is of very little
    value unless you can receive some kind of input from the outside
    world and can provide some kind of output to the outside
    world.&nbsp; Otherwise, what's the point?&nbsp; In the AGC, all of
    this connection to the outside world is provided by "i/o channels",
    which are memory-like locations into which the CPU can write data
    ("output channels") or from which it can read data ("input
    channels").&nbsp; The AGC i/o-channel address space allows for up to
    128 distinct i/o channels, the majority of which were not used for
    anything in the AGC hardware, and are assigned no specific purpose
    by the yaAGC simulation software ... thus, in writing your own AGC
    software, you can assign these unused i/o channels whatever function
    you like, as long as you have some way to feed data into the input
    channels and use the data placed in the output channels.<br>
    <br>
    So the basic steps to writing your own AGC software as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide what special purpose i/o you need to have, other than
        those for the DSKY (which will be handled by the existing DSKY
        software, of course), and assign channel-numbers to them in the
        unused region of the i/o-channel address space.</li>
      <li>Write a program which can feed this special purpose data into
        yaAGC (the AGC simulator) or read the special-purpose data from
        yaAGC.&nbsp; This is your own special-purpose AGC peripheral
        device.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Write AGC software that provides whatever functionality you
        want it to have, using data on these new, special-purpose i/o
        channels you've defined, and/or on pre-existing channels like
        those for the DSKY.</li>
      <li>Assemble your new AGC software using the yaYUL assembler.</li>
      <li>Simultaneously run yaAGC plus a DSKY-simulation program plus
        your new special-purpose peripheral device.</li>
      <li>...</li>
      <li>Profit!<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Actually, I lied in the title of this page and in item #7 of the
      list above.&nbsp; There's no profit, unless your own personal
      enjoyment and sense of accomplishment counts as profit.&nbsp;
      (Prove me wrong!)&nbsp; But the other topics, #1-5, are discussed
      further throughout the remainder of this page.</p>
    <p>An important thing to know about "embedded programming", of which
      AGC software is an example, is that there are two basic varieties
      of embedded programming and embedded programmers:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Bare-metal" programming — This is where you start from
        scratch, often writing the entire program yourself.&nbsp; In
        other words, you have a computer with a completely empty memory,
        with no program at all, and you write your own!&nbsp; This has
        the advantage of being simpler, since you don't have to take all
        the time to learn about how to work with all of the quirks in
        somebody else's software, and can confine yourself to worrying
        about the quirks of the hardware, which are usually
        simpler.&nbsp; This is often the approach taken in systems
        having extremely limited memory resources or speed, since such
        systems often don't have the resources to run software anybody
        else wrote anyway.&nbsp; For example, I imagine that most
        programming for <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino
          devices</a> is of this kind.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Programming with an "operating system" — This is where the
        system is already running software that provides a lot of useful
        services (such a time-keeping functions, file-systems,
        networking, and so on), and you are merely providing one small
        piece of the system's existing software puzzle and relying on
        the operating system for a lot of stuff that would otherwise be
        troublesome.&nbsp; This has the advantage, of course, that you
        don't have to figure out for yourself how to do some of these
        very hard things.&nbsp; This is generally the approach taken in
        a system like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry
          Pi</a>, which is very fast and has lots of memory and
        peripheral devices.&nbsp; In fact, programming for these devices
        is hardly "embedded" programming at all, since it's really just
        like programming a desktop computer that has been put into a
        very small, cheap box.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The AGC is an odd case, because while it has very, very small
      resources (tiny memory, terribly slow), it nevertheless has a
      pretty capable operating system written but a bunch of smart
      people.&nbsp; We will therefore cover both bare-metal programming
      and operating-system-based programming.&nbsp; My advice would be
      to start with the former until you're familiar with what you're
      doing, and then graduate to the latter if it turns out you need to
      do so.<br>
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
    <h2><a name="Your_Own_Peripheral_Devices"></a>Your Own Peripheral
      Devices</h2>
    The stock version of the AGC simulator program, yaAGC, interacts
    with its peripheral devices through what I like to refer to as
    "virtual wires".&nbsp; (Some customized versions of yaGC, such as
    the one used in NASSP don't use this method, so what I have to say
    here won't fully apply to them.)&nbsp; These virtual wires are a
    networking socket interface, in which yaAGC acts something like a
    network "server", and peripheral devices connect via a networking
    socket as "clients".&nbsp; The server (yaAGC) and the peripherals
    (such as the DSKY or your own custom peripheral device) exchange
    network packets whenever the values of the AGC's i/o channels
    change.<br>
    <br>
    Okay, that was a mouthful, and sounds very complex ... but isn't
    really, because you don't really need to know about it if you use
    the handy-dandy template for creating AGC peripheral devices we
    provide.&nbsp; But it was useful background information if you're
    too stinkin' proud to use our template, so we had to tell you all
    about it anyway.&nbsp; You can find more information about it on our
    <a href="developer.html#sendrecv_Protocol">developer page</a> if you
    need to!&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    As for the peripheral template program, though, it is called
    piPeripheral.py and <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/piPeripheral.py">you



      can find it in our GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp; As the name
    implies, piPeripheral.py is written in <a
      href="https://www.python.org/">the Python 3 language</a>.&nbsp;
    Python is a kind of scripting language which does not need to be
    compiled, and hence you can change the program and see the effects
    immediately.&nbsp; It's available, or already automatically
    installed, on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    The piPeripheral.py program is a couple of hundred lines long, and
    undoubtedly looks a bit complex if you don't know what you're
    looking at.&nbsp; Again, that complexity is an illusion, and there
    are only a couple of things you need to know to immediately begin
    working with it, if you're lucky enough to already be familiar with
    Python.&nbsp; In fact, you only need to look at or modify two of the
    program's functions, <tt>inputsForAGx</tt> and <tt>outputFromAGx</tt>:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>outputFromAGx(channel,value)</tt> — This is a function
        which is called automatically whenever an output channel in the
        AGC has changed.&nbsp; The <tt>channel</tt> parameter is the
        address of the output channel, in the range 0-127 (0-0177
        octal), while <tt>value</tt> is the new value of that channel,
        in the range 0-32767 (0-077777 octal).&nbsp; Your software can
        do anything you like with this data.&nbsp; Most channels you
        will likely ignore.&nbsp; For example, there's little need to do
        anything with data in DSKY channels like 010 (octal), 011, or
        013, since the DSKY peripheral will handle those.</li>
      <li><tt>inputsForAGx()</tt> — This is a function which is
        automatically called periodically (nominally every 50 ms), which
        allows you to specify zero or more AGC input channels and values
        that are supposed to be written into those channels.&nbsp; How
        this decision is made or where the data comes from originally is
        entirely up to you.&nbsp; By default, the function simply
        returns an empty list (in Python notation <tt>[]</tt>), and so
        none of the AGC's input channels are affected.&nbsp; But if the
        returned list contains one or more items, then the corresponding
        input channels will be changed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Actually, the values in the list of input channels returned by <tt>inputsForAGx()</tt>
      are something the Python language calls "tuples" or specifically,
      3-tuples.&nbsp; Each 3-tuple has, as you may imagine, 3 parts:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>( channel, value, mask )</tt><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    The interpretations of the <tt>channel</tt> and <tt>value</tt>
    parts are probably obvious.&nbsp; The <tt>mask</tt> part indicates
    which <i>bit positions</i> of the <tt>value</tt> are valid.&nbsp;
    Only the bit positions of <tt>value</tt> for which the <tt>mask</tt>
    is 1 end up affecting the AGC's input channel, and the bit positions
    in the input channel corresponding to 0 in in the <tt>mask</tt>
    remain unchanged.&nbsp; This feature is needed in general because
    some input channels have bit-fields controlled by one peripheral
    device and other bit-fields controlled by other peripheral devices,
    and you don't want a peripheral device to change the wrong
    bits.&nbsp; For i/o channels you've defined yourself, of course,
    that probably isn't an issue, and the <tt>mask</tt> could always be
    32677 (077777 octal).<br>
    <br>
    For example, in a given periodic call to <tt>inputsForAGx()</tt>,
    you might decide that the lower 3 bits of your custom input channel
    045 (octal) need to be changed to 05 (octal), and perhaps that the
    entire value of your custom channel 046 needs to be changed to
    012345.&nbsp; The list returned by <tt>inputsForAGx()</tt> would
    then be<br>
    <blockquote><tt>[ ( 0o45, 0o5, 0o00007), (0o46, 0o12345, 0o77777) ]</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Note that in Python 3, octal constants are prefixed by "0o".<br>
    <br>
    As for how to choose good addresses for your own custom i/o
    channels, it's probably best to avoid i/o channels already
    preassigned by the true AGC hardware and existing AGC mission
    software.&nbsp; While I'm not aware of any comprehensive list,
    addresses 0o0-0035 and 0o76-0o77 should be regarded as already
    allocated by the AGC hardware.&nbsp; In addition to those, the <i>simulated</i>
    AGC hardware, yaAGC, has defined various "fictitious i/o ports",
    working downward from address 0o177, for its own purposes.&nbsp; So
    to summarize all of that, my advice would be to confine any custom
    i/o channels you want to assign to the following ranges:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>0o40 - 0o67</li>
      <li>0o100-0o147</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As it happens, the sample peripheral program piPeripheral.py in
      our GitHub repository has been pepped up slightly from just a bare
      template.&nbsp; Additionally, it defines and processes several new
      i/o channels just to give examples of how to do so.&nbsp; This
      extra stuff is active only when the command-line switch <tt>--time=1</tt>
      (or actually, <tt>--time=<i>anything</i></tt>) is used, so you
      can easily eliminate it if you choose to build your own peripheral
      device starting from piPeripheral.py.&nbsp; Here's a list of these
      newly-assigned channels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AGC input channel 0o40 — Packed minutes and seconds of the
        current time, with seconds in the least-significant 6 bits and
        minutes in the next higher 6 bits.</li>
      <li>AGC input channel 0o41 — Packed month, day, and hours of the
        current date and time, with hours being the least-significant 5
        bits, day the next higher 5 bits, and month the next higher 4
        bits.</li>
      <li>AGC input channel 0o42 — The current year.</li>
      <li>AGC output channel 0o43 — The current year.</li>
      <li>AGC output channel 0o44 — The current month.</li>
      <li>AGC output channel 0o44 — The current day</li>
      <li>AGC output channel 0o44 — The current hour</li>
      <li>AGC output channel 0o44 — The current minute</li>
      <li>AGC output channel 0o44 — The current second</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The input channels are actively generated by piPeripheral.py,
      while the output channels merely have their contents printed
      out.&nbsp; The AGC program processing the input channels (in which
      the date and time is packed in a non-human-friendly way) <i>might</i>
      use the output channels for reporting human-friendly unpacked date
      &amp; time data.&nbsp; Of course, the AGC program might choose to
      do something else altogether or even nothing at all with these
      extra channels.<br>
    </p>
    <p>And of course, the main idea behind providing the current time
      and date in this way in the first place, is that it might serve as
      the basis for using the AGC+DSKY as a clock widget on a computer
      desktop.&nbsp; That's because we really <i>mean</i> the current
      time, and we don't mean something like "time since powerup", which
      is otherwise all that the AGC knows about on its own.&nbsp; This
      idea of a clock app is continued in the next section.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="Bare-Metal_Programming"></a>Bare-Metal Programming</h2>
    Alas! there's nothing akin to a higher-level language such a C or
    Python for the AGC.&nbsp; Thus, programming the AGC is ultimately an
    exercise in <i>assembly-language</i> programming, and specifically
    in the assembly language that's unique to the "Block 2" AGC.&nbsp;
    This is covered in more detail than many mortals would like on our <a
      href="assembly_language_manual.html">Block 2 AGC Language page</a>,
    so to start out, you'll either want to look that over, or at least
    to look over the concise "<a
      href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/hrst/archive/1689.pdf">AGC4
      Memo #9</a>" from which a lot of the information on that page
    comes.&nbsp; If you're not already somewhat-familiar with
    assembly-language programming in general, I won't pretend this will
    be easy for you.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you <i>do</i> have any
    previous familiarity with assembly language, all you'll really need
    to worry about is internalizing the AGC's unique non-contiguous
    memory map and register set, and getting an overview of the
    instruction set. <br>
    <br>
    Other than what I mentioned just now, the first important thing to
    know is that your AGC program will begin executing at address 04000
    (octal), which could look like this in assembly language:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SETLOC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4000<br>
        STARTUP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Do your own stuff from here on<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    But that's a bit of an over-simplification.&nbsp; The actual
    significance of address 04000 is that it's the start of an <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_vector_table">interrupt-vector



      table</a> — i.e., of code which is instantly automatically
    executed whenever certain exceptional conditions occurs.&nbsp; For
    example, if the DSKY sends the AGC a keystroke, it instantly
    "vectors" to the code that's associated with that condition, and
    it's not something that your AGC program necessarily has to
    explicitly check for.<br>
    <br>
    There are actually 11 different interrupt sources in the AGC,
    including power-up, and each of those interrupt-sources has 4 words
    allocated for it in the interrupt-vector table at address 04000, and
    <a href="assembly_language_manual.html#Interrupt_Processing">you can
      read about them here</a>.&nbsp; You can't just ignore them, even
    if you think you don't need them for anything, because you still
    have to worry about what happens if one of those interrupts occurs:
    you can't have the code just suddenly vector off into the middle of
    nowhere!&nbsp; So a minimal version of the code above that accounts
    for the full interrupt table might look like so:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SETLOC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4000<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        TCF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; STARTUP</tt><tt></tt><tt><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOOP<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOOP<br>

    </blockquote>
    Even here, we're still simplifying a bit, since what you'd find if
    you started filling in code after the label <tt>STARTUP</tt> is
    that your code might execute for a while and then just reset and
    start again at address 04000!&nbsp; What's up with that?&nbsp; Well,
    behind the scenes, the AGC hardware checks performs various checks
    to determine if the computer has somehow frozen up, and of course,
    yaAGC tries to perform whichever of those checks are appropriate as
    well.&nbsp; If it detects any of these conditions, it performs a
    jump to address 04000, just as if a power-up had occurred.&nbsp;
    That's one of the features that lends reliability to the
    device.&nbsp; This restart is known as a GOJAM.&nbsp; I'm not
    totally sure what all of the conditions that could trigger a GOJAM
    are, but <a
      href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/LUM225-PV_text.pdf">LUMINARY



      Memo #225</a> contains a handy list of 8 of them.&nbsp; The ones
    that are relevant to software that you yourself write are these:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Night Watchman — this expects a specific memory location
        (address 067 octal, usually labeled as <tt>NEWJOB</tt>) to be
        tested every so often.&nbsp; If <tt>NEWJOB</tt> isn't tested at
        reasonable intervals, then a GOJAM occurs.&nbsp; (In normal
        mission software, <tt>NEWJOB</tt> is a variable that relates to
        loading jobs into the "executive", and thus it's reasonable to
        expect it not to be ignored by the software.)&nbsp; Thus, you
        need to have some code that periodically reads this location,
        such as a <tt>CS NEWJOB</tt> instruction.</li>
      <li>RUPTLOCK — this check guards against interrupts being disabled
        for too long a period of time, or else for an interrupt service
        routine taking too long before executing its <tt>RESUME</tt>
        instruction to return to the main code.&nbsp; Thus, you must
        make sure that interrupts are usually enabled (and don't occur
        too often or take too long when they do).</li>
      <li>TC TRAP — this check guards against infinite loops of the form
        <tt>TC SELF</tt>.&nbsp; So if your AGC program actually has an
        end point after which it has finished up all of its work, it
        best to end it up with something more complex than an
        instruction to just keep looping at the same address.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taking all of that into consideration, here's a minimal framework
      you might use to start building your bare-metal AGC program:<br>

    <p>So here you have simple framework with a few empty places in
      which to insert your own code.&nbsp; Not to mention a few
      interrupt vectors (such as the DSKY keypad interrupts, KEYRUPT1
      and KEYRUPT2) that right now do nothing, but which you could
      imagine might be very helpful.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What might the functionality for reading DSKY keystrokes look
      like?&nbsp; Note that <a
        href="developer.html#Table_of_IO_Channels">info about the i/o
        channels pertaining to the DSKY are on the developer page</a>.&nbsp;
      Perhaps you'd use the KEYRUPT1 interrupt-service routine to read
      the input channel containing the DSKY keycode, and then store that
      keycode in a variable.&nbsp; Your main program loop might
      periodically check that variable to see it it contains anything,
      and then might output something to the DSKY so you'd know it had
      been detected.&nbsp; For example, it might toggle the DSKY's COMP
      ACTY lamp every time there was a new keycode detected.<br>

        align="right">With this, you actually have an AGC program that
      does something, and does it both visibly and testably ... if not
      very excitingly.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A slightly sleeker form of this code, called <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/piPeripheral.agc">piPeripheral.agc,



        which can be assembled with yaYUL and actually works if it is
        run in the AGC simulator, can be found in our GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp;
      Actually, the code in GitHub is not <i>merely</i> a cleaned-up
      form of the code above, but in fact implements processing of the
      current-timestamp information the sample peripheral program
      piPeripheral.py provides in the newly-minted AGC input channels
      040-042.&nbsp; (See the end of the preceding section.)&nbsp; What
      piPeripheral.agc does with that information (which is a packed
      form of the date and time) is to:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unpack the data into separate year, month, day, hour, minute,
        and second fields.</li>
      <li> Output the unpacked data fields in the newly-allocated AGC
        output channels 043-050.</li>
      <li>Display the data on the DSKY.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can actually see what this looks like on a simulated DSKY in
      the picture to right.&nbsp; What you see there is:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The year (2017) in DSKY register R3 (the bottom 5-digit area).</li>
      <li>The month (12) and the day (09) in DSKY register R2.</li>
      <li>The hour (06) and minute (19) in DSKY register R1.</li>
      <li>The seconds (10) in the NOUN area.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The piPeripheral.py program will have generated this data
      according to the preference settings on the compuer on which
      you're running it, which in my case is the U.S. CST time-zone ...
      so yes, I was doing this at around 6 in the morning, local time,
      on a Saturday.&nbsp; Yawn!&nbsp; I should be paid more (than the
      $0 I currently get) for doing this lousy job.&nbsp; :-)<br>
    </p>
    <p>At any rate, assuming one has written such a custom AGC program,
      a necessary step before being able to run it in the AGC simulator
      is to assemble it with the yaYUL assembler.&nbsp; Exactly how to
      find the assembler depends on the particular setup being used, but
      assuming you can find it (or better yet, have it in the "PATH"),
      assembly is a snap.&nbsp; But suppose, for example, that you
      simply want to assemble piPeripheral.agc; assuming you've retained
      the same directory setup as in GitHub, and have built the normal
      Virtual AGC software too, you could do something like the
      following without having to worry about path settings:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>cd virtualagc/piPeripheral</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>../yaYUL/yaYUL piPeripheral.agc</tt><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    The result (if there were no errors, and hopefully there wouldn't be
    for an unmodified piPeripheral.agc) would be the executable file
    piPeripheral.agc.bin.&nbsp; If there were assembly errors such as
    syntax problems or unallocated variables, of course, then you have
    to fix them ... a topic on which it's difficult to offer any general
    advice other than to start with a small program that assembles
    perfectly and slowly work towards having a larger program.&nbsp; <br>
    <p>Once the program is assembled, it can be run in the AGC
      simulator.&nbsp; This is again a tricky topic, since there are a
      variety of ways in which it can be done, and a variety of possible
      system configurations.&nbsp; What you would do on a desktop PC is
      undoubtedly not the same thing you'd do on the 3D-printed DSKY
      mentioned earlier.&nbsp; However, to just do it from a command
      line within our software tree as downloaded from GitHub and
      successfully built from source, in Linux you could do the
      following.<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt># Start up the AGC simulator with the custom AGC program,
          in the background, and discard all messages from it.<br>
          cd virtualagc/yaAGC</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>./yaAGC --core="../piPeripheral/piPeripheral.agc.bin"
          --port=19697 --cfg="../yaDSKY/src/LM.ini" &amp;&gt;/dev/null
          &amp;<br>
          # Start up the DSKY simulator in the background and discard
          all messages from it.<br>
          cd ../yaDSKY2</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>./yaDSKY2 --cfg="../yaDSKY/src/LM.ini" --port=19698
          &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;<br>
          # Start up the custom peripheral device, in the foreground,
          and don't discard its messages.&nbsp; You might need<br>
          # to install some extra Python modules, such as "sudo pip3
          install argparse", if this fails. <br>
          cd ../piPeripheral</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>./piPeripheral.py --port=19699 --time=1<br>
          # Now that the custom peripheral has been terminated, clean up
          the other programs we've started.<br>
          killall yaAGC yaDSKY2<br>
        </tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On Mac OS, I think it would be a bit trickier than what I'm
      written, since I don't think that yaDSKY2 as started this way
      would actually accept any keypress events; I'm not sure quite how
      to do it properly, though.&nbsp; On Windows, you would have to use
      backslashes ('\') in places of the forward slashes if used here
      ('/'); also, I don't know that using '&amp;' to put the programs
      into the background would work, or that "killall" would be
      available for killing those programs afterward, so you might want
      to run the various programs all in the foreground, in separate
      command-line consoles.&nbsp; But obviously, there's a way to do
      it, even if I'm too personally lazy to figure it out just
      yet.&nbsp; If anyone just wants to inform me of the correct
      detailed way of doing things on Mac OS X or Windows, I'd be happy
      to include that info here.<br>

    <h2><a name="Programming_for_the_AGC_Operating"></a>Programming for
      the AGC "Operating System"</h2>
    After one is comfortable with writing simple, bare-metal AGC
    applications as described in the preceding section, presumably one
    might want to graduate to producing more-complex AGC
    applications.&nbsp; For example, the bare-metal example doesn't
    allow you to use multi-tasking, nor to use the PROG/VERB/NOUN
    user-interface style, nor to use the various types of monitoring
    associated with the VERB/NOUN system, and so on.&nbsp; Admittedly,
    if you were sufficiently enthusiastic you might write all of the
    code to do that, though it might take quite a bit of effort and
    time.<br>
    <br>
    Alternatively, you could just use those features as-is, since they
    already exist within the existing AGC mission code.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, as far as I know, nobody has taken the effort to
    extract just the "operating system" content of the AGC mission code,
    as devoid from the various "programs" that run under that operating
    system.&nbsp; Actually, to be fair, it has been done, but only with
    Block 1 AGC code using an incompatible assembler, so it's not
    immediately useful.&nbsp; But with Block 2 code, no.&nbsp; It would
    be cool, but I'm too lazy to do it.&nbsp; (Anyone who wants to do it
    and send me a set of files that actually assembles and runs without
    error, please do so!)<br>
    <br>
    Lacking that, one could simply clone the code for an existing
    mission and try to adapt that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, perhaps, the
    existing mission code tends to be big and to fill most of available
    memory, making it difficult to fit in any new code.&nbsp; The trick
    to getting around that is to recognize a) that the mission code grew
    over time and that b) the "operating system" portions of the
    software were relatively stable pretty early.&nbsp; Thus if we
    choose a very early version of the Apollo-era AGC code to work from,
    we should have a fairly stable operating system with lots of free
    memory.&nbsp; And, of course, it would presumably be easier to strip
    unwanted programs out of an early (relatively feature-lacking)
    version of the code than out of a later one.<br>
    <br>
    The existing AGC code which seems to fit the bill is <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Retread44">RETREAD



      44</a>, which does not even use a third of the fixed program
    memory.<br>
    <br>
    As for how to write your program in such a way as to take advantage
    of the operating system ... TBD<br>
    <br>
    Assembling and running the code is the same as the steps provided at
    the end of the preceding section on bare-metal programming, though
    obviously the name and storage location of the AGC code changes.<br>
