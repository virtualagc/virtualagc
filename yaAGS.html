    <p>If you don't already know that the Abort Guidance System is,
      perhaps you'll want to continue on to <a
        href="#What_is_the_Abort_Guidance_System_AGS_">the next section</a>
      before before reading this section.&nbsp; But if you do already
      know everything there is to know about the AGS, and simply want to
      know what <i>we</i> are providing, I'll tell you that we provide
      a simulation of the AGS computer (the AEA), a simulation of the
      display/keyboard unit for it (the DEDA), <i>and</i> the original
      Apollo-era software which can be run on the AEA ... or at least, a
      couple of versions of the software.&nbsp; As with the Apollo
      Guidance Computer (AGC) proper, you can either run this simulated
      AGS in a standalone way, <i>or</i> you can take advantage of the
      fact our AGS simulation has been built into the Orbiter spacecraft
      simulator via <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nassp/">the
NASSP










        project</a>, and in so doing you can fly simulated aborts of
      lunar landings or ascents in a much-more realistic way.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Ryan Callaway has made a couple of videos of hypothetical Apollo
      12 aborts using the simulated AGS incorporated into NASSP, and
      posted them on YouTube.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we only have a couple
      of different versions of the original AGS software, known as
      "Flight Program 6" (FP6) and "Flight Program 8", and aren't
      entirely sure what versions were used for which missions.&nbsp;
      However, we believe that something very close to FP6 was used for
      Apollo 12, and that's what Ryan uses as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The first video illustrates an abort during the lunar descent,
      close to the surface; the abort process detaches LM ascent stage
      from the LM descent stage, and puts it into lunar orbit in which
      the Command Module can later rendezvous with it and dock.&nbsp; Of
      course, the computer system is just a black box hidden away
      somewhere in the Lunar Module, and isn't visible in these videos,
      and the visible representative of the AGS is the display and
      keyboard, the DEDA.&nbsp; The DEDA, which is at the lower
      right-hand corner of the instrument panel, doesn't appear until
      about a minute into the video.&nbsp; The Apollo Guidance
      Computer's display/keyboard (the "DSKY") also appears, in the
      bottom center of the instrument panel.&nbsp; You'll see that the
      abort is a relatively hands-off affair once it gets started, and
      it's largely a matter of the DEDA and DSKY both displaying the
      "velocity to be gained", with the AGS turning off the engines when
      that gets close enough to zero!<br>

    <div align="left"><br>
      This second video is similar, except that the abort takes place on
      the lunar surface itself, so I guess you could say it's not even
      really an "abort" at all ... it's just using the AGS to control
      the ascent rather than using the AGC to do so:<br>

        id="What_is_the_Abort_Guidance_System_AGS_"></a>What is the
      Abort Guidance System (AGS) or Abort Electronics Assembly (AEA)?<br>
    </h2>
    <a href="FlightControlSubsystem.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ;
        width: 459px; height: 406px;" alt="LM's Integrated Flight
        Control subsystem" src="FlightControlSubsystemSmall.jpg"
        width="459" hspace="12" height="406" align="right"></a>The AGS
    was a computer system used in the LM.&nbsp; It was a completely
    separate computer system from the LM's AGC, with a different
    architecture, different instruction-set, and different runtime
    software.&nbsp; It was in the LM as a kind of backup for the AGC,
    but was only supposed to be used (as the name implies) in case of an
    aborted lunar descent or ascent.&nbsp; The AGS doesn't have as
    commanding a role in the history of lunar explanation as does the
    AGC, because no aborts were ever needed in actual missions.&nbsp;
    However, when the AGS made its few appearances in history it did so
    dramatically.<br>
    <br>
    For example, the AGS was involved in a near-disaster during the
    Apollo 10, at the closest approach of the LM to the moon.&nbsp; This
    wasn't a flaw in the AGS or its software, of course.&nbsp; It was
    caused by problems executing the crew procedures. Recall that the
    mission of Apollo 10 was to orbit the moon, then to take the LM
    close to the lunar surface (but not to land), and then to jettison
    the LM's descent stage and return to orbit with the LM's ascent
    stage.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the LM ("Snoopy") staged, the plan was to do
    it under AGS/Attitude Hold, with Tom Stafford controlling the
    attitude with his hand-controller.&nbsp; As the LM approached the
    perilune of the Descent Orbit, at the point of simulated lunar
    liftoff, Stafford noticed a small yaw drift (caused, as it turned
    out, by yaw rate-gyro stiction) and presumably he wanted to not have
    to worry about controlling the LM's attitude when he was punching
    off the Descent Stage and firing the down-jets for separation.
    Unfortunately the AGS was mistakenly set for "CM pointing," only
    useful during rendezvous, so when he toggled back to Auto, from
    Attitude Hold, the AGS promptly fired the jets to get the LM facing
    the CM in its orbit, above and ahead of them. Because there were no
    real attitude rate limits for maneuvering in AGS, the Ascent Stage
    swung wildly back and forth as the AGS crudely did its normal thing,
    damping out the rates as it approached its target, and settled
    nicely where it was "supposed" to be with no inputs from
    Stafford.&nbsp; (See the <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
      href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a410/A10_MissionReport.pdf">mission










      report</a>.)&nbsp; So it all turned out okay.<br>
    <br>
    The AGS was used on the Apollo 11 mission also, when Armstrong
    decided not to do the proper attitude sequence as he was getting
    ready to re-dock with Columbia after returning from the moon. He
    rolled the LM through PGNS gimbal lock, instead of yawing and
    pitching, and had to switch to the AGS for attitude control.<br>
    <br>
    Amusingly, the AGS was orginally called the "Backup Guidance System"
    but its acronym (BUGS) apparently was not considered suitable.<br>
    <br>
    The AGS was developed by <span style="font-family:
      helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-style: italic;">TRW</span>,
    rather than by the MIT Instrumention Lab that developed the AGC, so
    there was no overlap in development personnel between the AGS and
    AGC systems.&nbsp; Furthermore, there was almost no overlap in
    engineering technique, other than that both groups of necessity were
    generally constrained by the technology available at the time.&nbsp;
    For example, both needed to use memory based on ferrite-core
    technology.&nbsp; Moreover, there was no interaction between the AGS
    and AGC systems, other than a downlink enabling the AGS to download
    the AGC's navigational data (and thus avoiding manual entry of data)
    .<br>
    <br>
    Strictly speaking, the computer part of the AGS is called the Abort
    Electronics Assembly (AEA), and so you may sometimes see references
    to the AEA rather than the AGS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Various components in
    the AGS include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The AEA—the computer itself.</li>
      <li>The Abort Sensor Assembly—a simple inertial measuring system,
        strapdown rather than gimballed.</li>
      <li>The Data Entry and Display Assembly (DEDA)—similar to the
        AGC's DSKY.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    The AEA can process Rendezvous Radar data but not Landing Radar
    data, which makes sense because it's only potential use was to get
    away from the immediate vicinity of the lunar surface.&nbsp; There
    is, however, a story that Gene Cernan says they had figured out how
    to use the AGS to land the LM without an AGC.&nbsp; This may have
    been Gene pulling somebody's leg, but I'm gullable enough or
    possibly ignorant enough to believe it.<br>

        is the principle (and almost complete) reference for
        understanding the operation of the AEA CPU <span
          style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>, the AEA assembly
        language and assembler, and the operation of the CPU's i/o
        ports.&nbsp; There are, however, some confusing aspects to the
        document:<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Perhaps the most confusing thing is that while the portion
          of the document that covers the LEMAP assembler makes it clear
          that the integer -1 would be encoded in octal as 0777777 (as
          anyone working with a modern PC would expect), the portion of
          the document that covers assembly language repeatedly refers
          to the octal 0400000 as being "-1". &nbsp; (More specifically,
          the reference on these occasions is to "A0 = 1, A1 thru A17 =
          0", where A0 is the sign bit and A1-A17 are the data
          bits.)&nbsp; In fact, this octal pattern encodes the "largest"
          18-bit negative number, namely -131072.&nbsp; In this detail,
          the assembly-language portion of the manual is thus incorrect.</li>
        <li>Perhaps the most serious omission is that the explanation of
          division (the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DVP</span>
          instruction) in the case where the dividend and/or divisor is
          negative is completely lacking and (in the absence of this
          explanation) I've never figured out satisfactorily how it is
          supposed to work</li>

            <br>
            Regarding Apollo 12:&nbsp; This is less obvious than the
            Apollo 11 case, since Apollo 12 was an "H" type mission
            rather than a "G" type mission.&nbsp; A couple of

            continued to use FP6.&nbsp; (The documents mentioned are the

              13 (page 101)</a> missions allow us to conclude that
            Apollo 12 and 13 used different versions of the AGS Flight
            Program.&nbsp; The AGS portions of these "dictionaries"
            relevant to our discussion are basically lists of AGS memory
            locations, including descriptions and the allowed values
            they can contain.&nbsp; Since the dictionaries for Apollo 12
            and 13 differ slightly, the AGS software versions must
            differ as well. An example is addresses 225/226.&nbsp; Since
            Apollo 12 (see preceding entry in this table) used FP6, then
            we'd conclude that Apollo 13 used a later version of the
            Flight Program.<br>
            <br>
            Just as we can conclude that Apollo 12 and 13 used different
            versions of the software, we can conclude that Apollo 13 and
            14 used the same version.&nbsp; We can do this by comparing
            the Apollo 13 G&amp;N Dictionary described above with
            the&nbsp; <a
              href="Documents/LM%20PGNS-AGS%20Training%20Card.pdf">"LM
              PGNS/AGS Training Card"</a>, because the training card
            also contains a list of AGS memory addresses, and that list
            agrees with the Apollo 13 dictionary.&nbsp; But beyond that,
            the training card specifically states that it covers:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Apollo 14</li>
              <li>AGC software Luminary 178 (which was used in the
                Apollo 14 LM)</li>
              <li>AGC Flight Program 7<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            A summary of all that is:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Apollo 14 used AGS Flight Program 7</li>
              <li>Apollo 13 used the same AGS Flight Program as Apollo
                14</li>
              <li>Apollo 13 used different AGS software than Apollo 12,
                which is known to have used Flight program 6.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The conclusion that both Apollo 13 and 14 used FP7 is
              inescapable.<br>
            </p>
            <p>By the way, it's tempting to say that it doesn't really
              matter for Apollo 13 which flight program version was
              used, since because of the service-module explosion there
              was no lunar landing.&nbsp; But in fact, <a
href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap13fj/19day5-themanualcoursecorrection.html">the








                AGS <i>was</i> in fact used in Apollo 13 for a manual
                course correction</a>.&nbsp; My reading of the linked
              flight log is that the AGS/DEDA was only used in the
              course correction to monitor velocity (AGS address
              470).&nbsp; But this was identical in FP6 and FP8, and
              therefore presumably in FP7.&nbsp; In other words, even
              though we presently have no copy of FP7, either FP6 or FP8
              might suffice in a simulation of an Apollo 13 mission.<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">While we have no program

                  AGS computer went through an evolutionary period in
                  which designers clarified and settled the
                  requirements. The first design for the system did not
                  include a true computer at all but rather a
                  "programmer," a fairly straightforward sequencer of
                  about 2,000 words fixed memory, which did not have
                  navigation functions. Its job was simply to abort the
                  LEM to a "clear" lunar orbit (one that would be higher
                  than any mountain ranges) at which point the crew
                  would wait for rescue from the CM, with its more
                  sophisticated navigation and maneuvering system</font><b><font

                  requirements changed in the fall of 1964. To, provide
                  more autonomy and safety, the AGS had to provide
                  rendezvous capability without outside sources of
                  information</font><font face="Geneva">. TRW, the
                  contractor, then decided to include a computer of
                  about 4,000 words memory. The company considered an
                  existing Univector accumulation machine but, instead,

    <ul>
      <li>10000 (octal) words of memory.&nbsp; The lower 4000 (octal)
        words were "temporary" memory, while the upper 4000 (octal)
        words were "permanent" memory.&nbsp; These two banks differed in
        that an "inhibit" signal was omitted in the upper bank, so that
        the contents could not be altered by the running program.&nbsp;
        The memory-cycle time is 5 μs.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Memory words were 18 bits.&nbsp; Instructions used 5 bits as
        an operation code, 12 bits as an address, and 1 bit to indicate
        whether or not the address was indexed.&nbsp; (For an indexed
        instruction, the address was altered when the instruction was
        executed by adding the contents of a dedicated index
        register.)&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
      <li>Data words were 2's complement.&nbsp; In the case of many
        calculations, a fixed-point discipline was used, so that
        fractional values could be used.&nbsp; This method is similar
        using a slide rule—a paradigm naturally quite familiar to the
        programmers of that time.&nbsp; (A slide rule represents only
        numbers in the range 0 to 1 and the user is supposed to mentally
        track the position of the decimal point for each successive
        multiplication or division he or she performs.)</li>
      <li>There were several dedicated registers, outside of the
        memory-address space.&nbsp; Some of them, like the <span

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> is the program which
    emulates the AGS CPU.&nbsp; In other words, it loads the binary form
    of the AGS flight software, or other software newly written for
    verification purposes, and then executes that software on a cycle by
    cycle basis, emulating the CPU's architecture and instruction
    set.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The program has just become operational (2005-06-15), but probably
    with plenty of bugs to fix.<br>
    <br>
    Of itself, the emulation is not very visually exciting, since the
    CPU requires peripheral devices as well.&nbsp; The peripherals are
    not provided directly by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>;
    rather, they must be emulated by separately-provided software.&nbsp;
    (Once these peripherals are available for <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaAGC</span>, we'll work to make them available for <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> as well.)&nbsp; This
    technique allows a developer of (for example) a lunar lander
    simulation to use the CPU emulation, but to replace simulated
    peripherals in order to achieve better integration.&nbsp; The
    principal peripheral is the DEDA (see below).<br>

            src="yaDEDAscreenshot-thumb.jpg" width="203" height="230"
            align="right"></a>The term <span style="font-style:
          italic;">DEDA</span> refers to the Data Entry and Display
        Assembly, which is the assembly used by the astronauts to enter
        data into the AGS, or to see data displayed by the AGS.&nbsp;
        The DEDA was mounted in the lower-right portion of the LM's
        control panel, just in front of the LMP (Lunar Module
        Pilot).&nbsp; Recall that in the somewhat odd terminology
        employed in the Apollo program, the LMP did not actually pilot
        the LM.&nbsp; Rather, the commander piloted the LM from the
        left-hand position.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> is an emulation
        of the DEDA for use with <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp;
However,










        it is certainly possible for the developer of a LM simulation to
        develop his or her own emulation of the DEDA.&nbsp; Indeed, the
        program <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA2</span> has now
        superceded the original <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>
        program, although the original is still available if someone was
        interested in it.&nbsp; When I refer to "yaDEDA" below, I
        actually mean to refer interchangeably to both "yaDEDA" and
        "yaDEDA2" unless I state otherwise.&nbsp; For information on
        developing these kinds of alternative implementations, you
        should refer to the <a href="developer.html">developer info
          page</a>.&nbsp; You'll notice that the screenshot of <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> to the right is
        somewhat different from the drawing of the DEDA above,
        particularly as to the HOLD-key; that's because of discrepancies
        in the available documentation, so feedback on this issue is
        particularly welcome.<br>
        <br>
        Unlike the DSKY, which is basically completely useless without
        the AGC, the DEDA has some built-in smarts.&nbsp; Actually, most
        of the DEDA user-interface is built into the DEDA, and so <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> can be operated even
        without the presence of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp;
Notice










        that the DEDA has two displays:&nbsp; a three-digit display
        which is an octal "address", and a 5-digit display (plus sign)
        of "data".&nbsp; Quite a lot of the operation of the DEDA was
        simply to enter an address (in the first 512 bytes of AEA
        memory), after which the AEA would output the value of that
        memory location every half-second.&nbsp; The AEA software would
        format the data, which could be either octal or decimal, or
        could involve various scale factors or units.&nbsp; However, the
        units and scaling and octal vs. decimal choices are hardcoded
        into the AEA software, and are not selectable by the user.&nbsp;
        This mode persists until pressing the HOLD key, which signals
        the AEA software to stop outputting data.&nbsp; (After hitting
        HOLD, you could hit READOUT again to restart the
        data-monitoring.)&nbsp; To put the DEDA/AEA in this continuous
        readout mode, you do the following on the DEDA keypad:<br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"> CLR <span style="font-style:
            italic;">OctalDigit</span> <span style="font-style:
            italic;">OctalDigit</span> <span style="font-style:
            italic;">OctalDigit</span> READOUT<br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> <br>
            The digits appear on the address display as you enter
            them.&nbsp; Any error in entering this sequence causes the
            OPR ERR lamp to light, making the DEDA basically inoperative
            until the CLR key is pressed again.&nbsp; All of this,
            except for the actual generation of the data, occurs within
            the DEDA without needing an AEA (<span style="font-weight:
              bold;">yaAGS</span>).<br>
            <br>
            The other thing you can do with the DEDA user interface is
            to perform data entry:&nbsp; i.e., to send the AEA a command
            or data.&nbsp; The interpretation of the data you enter is
            dependent on the address you enter:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;"> CLR <span
                style="font-style: italic;">OctalDigit</span> <span
                style="font-style: italic;">OctalDigit</span> <span
                style="font-style: italic;">OctalDigit</span> <span
                style="font-style: italic;">Sign Digit Digit Digit Digit
                Digit</span> ENTR<br>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        Again, both the 3-octal-digit address and the 5-digit data (plus
        sign) appear on the display as you strike the keys, but any
        departure from the above sequence lights the OPR ERR lamp, which
        can only be cleared with CLR.&nbsp; The 5-digit data can be
        either octal or decimal, but this is address-dependent (as
        hardcoded into the AEA software), so it's not a matter of your
        choice.&nbsp; Other than the actions which this type of
        operation is supposed to cause within the AEA, all of this takes
        place within <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>.<br>
        <br>

              default this is "localhost"---i.e., the two are running on
              the same computer. However, a different IP address may be
              specified using this command-line switch. In Linux, this
              may be either the machine's name, or else a numerical
              address in dotted format (n.n.n.n). MS-Windows---at least
              Windows 98---is somewhat crippled in this respect, and

    the "LEM Assembly Program", or <span style="font-weight: bold;">LEMAP</span>.&nbsp;
You










    can read all about it in the document by H. L. Stiverson (see
    above).&nbsp; We don't have the code for the original
    cross-assembler, nor (if we did) do most of you have access to the
    type of computer on which it ran.&nbsp; So, we're providing you with
    a completely new assembler that can assemble the original
    flight-software source code into a binary usable by the AGS CPU
    emulation, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp;
    Naturally, we call this new cross-assembler <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The command-line syntax for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>
    is:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">yaLEMAP [OPTIONS] <span style="font-style: italic;">SourceFilename</span></span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The only presently-defined option is:<br>
    <br>
    --compare=<span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This switch causes the assembler to
      load the binary file called <span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span>,
      and to compare the binary output produced by assembly of the
      source code to the contents of <span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span>.&nbsp;
Presumably,










      <span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span> was produced by
      an earlier run of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>
      or <span style="font-weight: bold;">binLEMAP</span> (see
      below).&nbsp; This is type of comparison is useful principally for
      regression testing of the assembler itself, and (indeed) such
      regression testing is performed during a normal build.&nbsp; This
      switch also causes a change in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>'s
return










      codes, which are normally based on the presence of errors and
      warnings.&nbsp; (In other words, a non-zero return code normally
      occurs in case there are errors during assembly.)&nbsp; With the
      "--compare" switch, though, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>
      has a return code of zero when the binaries match, and a non-zero
      return code when they don't match.&nbsp; Naturally, one could use
      operating-system utilities (such as <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">fc</span> in Win32 or <span style="font-weight: bold;">diff</span>
      in Linux) to mimic this functionality as well; however, the
      "--compare" switch also has the property of adding meaningful
      messages about any mismatches to the assembly listing, which the
      operating-system utilities do not.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --html<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> (20090629 and later.)&nbsp; Causes
      creation of an HTML version of the assembly listing.&nbsp; The
      HTML filename is the same as <span style="font-style: italic;">SourceFile</span>,
      except that the .ags filename extension (if present) is replaced
      with .html.&nbsp; The HTML is syntax-highlighted, so that it is
      easy to distinguish opcodes from line labels, etc.&nbsp; Finally,
      the HTML contains hyperlinking from where symbols are used to
      where they are defined.&nbsp; <a href="SourceAnnotations.html">It
        is also possible to define modern annotations for the source
        code</a>.<br>
    </div>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span> is a simpler program
    in may ways than the AGC cross-assembler <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaYUL</span>.&nbsp; There are several reasons for this:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The architecture, and particularly the memory-map of the AGS
        is much more regular than that of the AGC.</li>
      <li>The AGC assembler has to worry about assembling several
        different kinds of languages in the same source file:&nbsp; AGC
        assembly language, AGC interpretive language, telemetry downlink
        language, and perhaps others I've forgotten about.&nbsp; The AGS
        assembler only has to worry about AGS assembly language.</li>
      <li>The AGS flight programs are so much shorter than AGC flight
        programs -- about ten times shorter, in fact.&nbsp; Therefore, a
        complete AGS flight program can be conveniently provided in a
        single source file, rather than having to break it up into 30 or
        40 shorter files as is done with the AGC flight programs.</li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span> always outputs its
    binary in a file called yaLEMAP.bin, which has a format compatible
    with both <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> (see above)
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">binLEMAP</span> (see
    below).&nbsp; Similarly, the assembly listing file is always output
    to the file yaLEMAP.lst.&nbsp; The listing format is not identical
    to that of the original <span style="font-weight: bold;">LEMAP</span>
    program, but its flavor is pretty similar, and the changes are
    probably more in line with today's thinking.&nbsp; (For example, in
    the symbol tables produced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>,
    the symbols are referenced to their numerical values.&nbsp; In
    symbol tables produced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">LEMAP</span>,
    the symbols are referenced to line numbers within the assembly
    listing, and you can look at that line number to see the numerical
    value which has been assigned.&nbsp; That's logical, perhaps, in a
    world where everybody is looking at paper printouts; it's not
    logical in an online world, so I haven't felt too bad about changing
    it.)<br>
    <br>
    The syntax of the source code for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>
    similarly isn't identical to that accepted by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">LEMAP</span> as outlined in the <a
      href="Pultorak_files/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf"> AGS
      programmer's manual</a>, but it's pretty close.&nbsp; The
    principal differences are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span> is not
        column-dependent the way <span style="font-weight: bold;">LEMAP</span>
        is, except that labels are still expected to begin in column 1.</li>
      <li>Comments in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>
        are expected to begin with the symbol '#'.&nbsp; Anything
        following the '#' symbol to the end of a line is ignored.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Utility_Programs" id="Utility_Programs"></a>Utility
      Programs</h2>
    <h3>binLEMAP, for ASCII Entry of AGS Executable Binary<br>
    </h3>
    There are two distinct ways of obtaining executable AGS binaries
    from an AGS assembly listing.&nbsp; You could enter the
    assembly-language instructions into the computer, creating source
    code that can be assembled with <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>
    as explained above.&nbsp; Or, you could enter the octal form of the
    opcodes into the computer, creating a file of numbers that can be
    processed with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">binLEMAP</span>
    utility.&nbsp; In fact, for verification purposes we do both, and
    then compare the results as explained below.<br>
    <br>
    Use of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">binLEMAP</span> utility
    is quite simple, as it has no command-line options.&nbsp; It simply
    reads the standard input and creates a file called
    binLEMAP.bin.&nbsp; The command-line syntax is:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">binLEMAP &lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">InputFile<br>
        </span></span>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> <br>
        The output file, binLEMAP.bin, consists of 10000 (octal)
        entries, each one of which is a 32-bit unsigned integer in
        little-endian format (i.e. with the least-significant byte
        first).&nbsp; The first entry represents AGS memory address 0,
        the second represents AGS memory address 1, and so forth.&nbsp;
        This file is therefore always exactly 16384 (decimal) bytes in
        size.<br>
        <br>
        The input file obeys the following simple rules, tailored to
        match the way the assembled data appears in <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">LEMAP</span> assembly listings, in
        order to make data entry easy:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Anything following the '#' character is treated as a
            comment and is discarded.</li>
          <li>All appearances of the character 'p' are removed and
            replaced by blank spaces.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Blank lines (after removal of comments and extraneous
            white space) are discarded.</li>
          <li>A line of the form "ORG <span style="font-style: italic;">OctalValue</span>"
            resets the location counter (which starts at 0) to the
            indicated value.</li>
          <li>A line consisting of an octal number is stored at the
            location counter, which is then incremented.</li>
          <li>A line consisting of three octal numbers is processed to a
            single octal number, which is stored at the location
            counter, which is then incremented.&nbsp; (The three values
            are treated as a 6-bit opcode, a 1-bit index flag, and a
            12-bit address.&nbsp; The opcode and index flag are
            logically ORred, the result is shifted upward 12 bits, and
            then logically ORred with the address.)</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of the rather odd rule about removal of the
        character 'p' is that it means an optional 'p' can be inserted
        after an octal number.&nbsp; It helps me in my proofing to run
        these files through the text-to-speech converter on an iMac, and
        this subterfuge of adding the extra 'p' fools the iMac's
        text-to-speech converter into pronouncing the numbers in the way
        I want.<br>

    The following versions of AGS flight software are available:<br>

        Bernardini tells us that according to the A17 Flight Readiness
        Review documentation, that the software was released April 28,
        1971 ... and of course, the fact that it was specified implies
        that it was used for Apollo 17.&nbsp; From the release date, we
        conclude that it could not have flown before Apollo 15.&nbsp;
        Thus, we assume it was used for Apollo 15-17.&nbsp; The source
        code and binary are available, and are believed to be 100%
        complete and correct.<br>

    <h3><a name="Validity" id="Validity"></a>Validity</h3>
    Validation of the AGS source code is somewhat streamlined from the
    method used to validate AGC source code.&nbsp; The following process
    is used:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The source code is entered into the computer from the assembly
        listings.&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
      <li>It is assembled with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span>
        cross-assembler.&nbsp; As a byproduct, a ASCII file is produced
        with just the columns of the assembly listing containing the
        assembled octal values.</li>
      <li>The byproduct ASCII file mentioned above is fed into a
        text-to-speech converter program, and the now-audible octal
        codes are compared visually against the original scan of the
        assembly listing.&nbsp; The source files are fixed as needed
        when mismatches are found.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Obviously, it's a matter of opinion how many times the&nbsp;
    proofing process described above needs to be repeated.&nbsp; I have
    repeated it only until the embedded checksums are correct.&nbsp; If
    anyone wants to volunteer to perform additional proofing—for
    example, of the program comments, which are not checked by the
    process I used—feel free to do so and to report the results to me.<br>

        id="Special_Problems_of_Flight_Program_6_"></a>Special Problems
      of Flight Program 6<br>
    </h3>
    Unfortunately, the assembly listing we have of Flight Program 6 is
    missing a couple of pages (namely, pp. 90 and 96).&nbsp; From
    comparison of FP6 and FP8, I believe that the missing pages contain
    code that has not changed between FP6 and FP8, and therefore have
    simply substituted the corresponding chunks of code from FP8 into
    FP6.&nbsp; The types of circumstantial evidence that this is
    acceptable are as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The code preceding and following the missing chunks is the
        same in FP6 and FP8.</li>
      <li>The line-count of the missing chunks matches in FP6 and
        FP8.&nbsp; (37 lines are missing in both cases.)</li>
      <li>The lengths of the address ranges of the missing chunks match
        in FP6 and FP8.&nbsp; (Actually, the addresses themselves match
        rather than merely the lengths of the ranges.&nbsp; In other
        words, this entire section of code assembles not just to the
        same binaries in FP6 and FP8, but literally to the same memory
        addresses.&nbsp; That's stability for you!)<br>
      </li>
      <li>The assembly listings contain both symbol tables (giving the
        value of each symbol) and symbol-usage tables (listing all the
        lines of code where each symbol is used).&nbsp; I have not yet
        compared the symbol tables for FP6 and FP8 in the appropriate
        address ranges, since it is very involved and I am busy.&nbsp;
        (If you want to volunteer to do this, contact me!)</li>
      <li>As explained earlier, the checksums need to be correct.&nbsp;
        And indeed, they <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span>
        correct.&nbsp; Actually, it turns out that the checksum for the
        address range 4000-7777 (octal), which contains these missing
        pages, is identical for FP6 and FP8, leading us to believe that
        this entire memory block has not changed at all.</li>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Finally</span>, if you refer
        to page 72 of the TRW <a
          href="http://klabs.org/history/ntrs_docs/manned/apollo/1969024052.pdf">
          LM/AGS Design Survey</a> document, you'll find the following
        explanation:&nbsp; "The equations programmed into the hardwired
        portion of the memory are identical&nbsp; in all flight
        computers (except for a few early prototype computers used for
        test purposes).&nbsp; The equations programmed into the
        softwired portion of the memory are subject to change from
        mission to mission."&nbsp; The hardwired portion of the program
        is, of course, the address range 4000-7777.&nbsp; On p. 30 of
        the same document, you'll find the additional explanation that
        the hardwired portion of the program is designated "HO3", but
        that the earlier versions (for the "early prototype computers")
        were designated "HO1" and "HO2".&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp;
        invariance of the hardwired portion of the program is a design
        feature rather than an accidental characteristic.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    This all seems pretty conclusive, but if you <span
      style="font-style: italic;">have</span> a listing of FP6, please
    scan pages 90 and 96 and send them to me and save us this dreadful
    uncertainty!&nbsp; (Of course, if you have other versions of the
    program, scan them and send them to me too!&nbsp; Or send them to me
    via snail-mail, and I'll scan them and return them.)<br>

            <div style="text-align: left;"> The description that follows
              covers the "classic" debugging mode for versions prior to
              20090427.&nbsp; I retain this description as-is for the
              benefit of those using one of those versions of <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp; However,
              for versions 20090427 and later, command-line debugging is
              in the process of changing to a style more closely related
              to that of the widely used <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">gdb</span> program, and the "classic" mode
              described below will gradually disappear.&nbsp; Since
              these changes have been driven by Onno Hommes, we have
              agreed that Onno will maintain documentation for the new
              debugging mode at <a

    <br>
    When the "--debug" command-line switch is used, a mode is entered in
    which AGS programs can be debugged.&nbsp; This mode is very
    primitive compared (for example) to the facilities provided by a
    debugging program like <span style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>,
    but has been pretty useful for my purposes, and may conceivably be
    useful for yours.&nbsp; You are unlikely to find this mode (or my
    description of the mode!) of any use unless you are very familiar
    with AGS assembly language, and are writing/debugging AGS
    code.&nbsp; In this mode, rather than simply running the software
    contained within the core image, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
    halts prior to executing the first instruction of the program and
    allows you to interactively determine its further actions.&nbsp; You
    are presented with a status message and a prompt from which you can
    enter commands.<br>
    <br>
    The debugging mode's status display may look something like this:<br>
    <br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:

      <span style="font-family: monospace;">&gt;</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    We see the current values (in octal) of various important CPU
    registers.&nbsp; All numerical values displayed by the debugger are
    in octal, because octal notation is used almost exclusively
    throughout&nbsp; existing AGS code, and because almost all of the
    numerical values reported by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">LEMAP</span>
    assembler were in octal.&nbsp; The values shown are for:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The A(ccumulator) register.</li>
      <li>The Q(uotient) register.</li>
      <li>The Overflow flag.</li>
      <li>The Index register.</li>
      <li>Whether the CPU is halted (by the DLY instruction) until the
        next 20 ms. signal.</li>
      <li>The number of times (in decimal) that this particular type of
        CPU instruction has been executed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>How many cycles (of 0.9765625 microseconds each) have elapsed
        since the program started.</li>
    </ul>
    The final status line is, of course, a disassembly of the next
    instruction scheduled to be executed.&nbsp; It shows the current
    address (<span style="font-family: monospace;">6000</span>), the
    octal value of the instruction (<span style="font-family:
      monospace;">706177</span>), and a disassembly of that octal value
    into assembly-language (<span style="font-family: monospace;">DLY
      6177</span>).&nbsp; The debugging mode does not currently
    understand any labels defined within the AGS program itself;
    therefore, understanding code like "<span style="font-family:
      monospace;">DLY 6177</span>" as something like "<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">DLY INIT</span>" (involving
    labels) is aided by having a symbol table or assembly listing at
    hand.<br>
    <br>
    The debugger understands addresses in one of three formats:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Addresses within memory are represented by a single octal
        number, such as 1234.&nbsp; Modifiable memory is in the range
        0000-3777, while non-modifiable memory is in the range
        4000-7777.</li>
      <li>Addresses within input-channel space (i.e., accessed by the <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">INP</span> instruction) are
        prefixed by 'I', such as I2020.</li>
      <li>Addresses within output-channel space (i.e., accessed by the <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">OUT</span> instruction) are
        prefixed by 'O', such as O2020.&nbsp; There is also a fictional
        output register O0, which is used by <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">yaAGS</span> to combine all of the discrete
        outputs.&nbsp; The bit positions within O0 correspond to the AEA
        CPU's discrete outputs as follows:</li>

    Within the status display's instruction-disassembly, the distinction
    between memory locations and i/o channels is always obvious, so i/o
    channel numbers are not prefixed by 'I' or 'O' in disassemblies.<br>
    <br>
    The user-commands which are currently recognized by the debugger
    are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>#<span style="font-style: italic;">Anything</span>—(i.e., any
        string beginning with the character '#' in the first column) is
        a comment, which is discarded without a warning message.&nbsp;
        This is principally useful for writing scripts (which has not
        yet been implemented).<br>
      </li>
      <li>BREAK <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>—defines a
        new breakpoint at memory-address <span style="font-style:
          italic;">A</span>.&nbsp; The program will halt upon
        encountering an instruction at the address of the breakpoint.<br>
      </li>
      <li>BREAKPOINTS—displays all currently-defined breakpoints and
        watchpoints.</li>
      <li>CONT—begin running the program.&nbsp; The program will simply
        run until encountering a breakpoint.<br>
      </li>
      <li>CONT-TIL-NEW—same, but also stop if an instruction-type not
        previously encountered in this session is hit.&nbsp; (Only good,
        obviously, for debugging the simulation.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>DELETE—without an address, DELETE simply deletes all existing
        breakpoints and watchpoints.</li>
      <li>DELETE <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>—deletes the
        breakpoint or watchpoint (if any) currently defined at address <span
          style="font-style: italic;">A</span>.&nbsp; The address should
        be prefixed with 'I' or 'O' for i/o channel addresses.</li>
      <li>DUMP—without arguments (i.e, no <span style="font-style:
          italic;">N</span> and no <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>),
a










        dump is performed using the last <span style="font-style:
          italic;">N</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>
        previously used.</li>
      <li>DUMP [<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>] <span
          style="font-style: italic;">A</span>—displays the current
        contents of <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>
        successive memory locations or i/o channels, starting at address
        <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>.&nbsp; The formats
        allowed in <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span> are
        described above.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>
        is shown in brackets to indicate that it is optional.&nbsp; If <span
          style="font-style: italic;">N</span> is omitted, it defaults
        to 1.&nbsp; Since no i/o channels are at consecutive addresses,
        no <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> option is allowed
        for i/o-channel addresses.</li>
      <li>QUIT or EXIT—exits <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.</li>
      <li>STEP [<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>] or NEXT [<span
          style="font-style: italic;">N</span>]—executes the next <span
          style="font-style: italic;">N</span> assembly-language
        instructions.&nbsp; If <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>
        is omitted, then it defaults to 1.&nbsp; Notes that this command
        can be abbreviated as 'S' or as 'N'.<br>
      </li>
      <li>WATCH <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>—defines a
        new watchpoint at erasable-memory address <span
          style="font-style: italic;">A</span> (using one of the address
        formats described above).&nbsp; The program will halt <span
          style="font-style: italic;">after</span> executing an
        instruction that changes the value stored at the address of the
        watchpoint.<br>
      </li>
      <li>EDIT <span style="font-style: italic;">A V</span>—stores the
        octal value <span style="font-style: italic;">V</span> at the
        adress <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>.&nbsp; The
        formats allowed in <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>
        are described above.&nbsp; Unlike the other commands above, this
        command supports the fictitious "output" addresses like 2410
        which set or reset a discrete output.&nbsp; Note also that for
        output-channel addresses, appropriate instruction packets
        associated with the output channels are transmitted to
        peripheral devices.&nbsp; Instead of an address, you can also
        access the CPU's internal registers using one of the following
        for <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>.&nbsp; (Note
        that "EDIT PC" only changes the program counter, and not the
        complete CPU state, so it's better to use the BACKTRACE command
        if possible.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> PC<br>
      A<br>
      Q<br>
      OVERFLOW<br>
      INDEX<br>
      HALT<br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <ul>
          <li>BACKTRACES—displays the most recent (50) backtrace points
            (i.e., points at which the program branched).</li>
          <li>BACKTRACE <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>—restores
the










            state of the system (CPU, memory, i/o channels) to backtrace
            point #<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> (from the
            list displayed by the BACKTRACES command).</li>
          <li>DISASSEMBLE [[<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>]
            <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>]—disassembles N
            instructions starting at address <span style="font-style:
              italic;">A</span>.&nbsp; By default <span
              style="font-style: italic;">A</span> is the current
            address of the program counter and <span style="font-style:
              italic;">N</span> is its prior value (starting at 24 when
            the program starts).</li>
          <li>COUNTS—displays a list of the number of times each type of
            AEA instruction has been executed.&nbsp; The numbers are in
            decimal.</li>
          <li>PATTERN <span style="font-style: italic;">V M</span>—sets
            a "pattern" with value <span style="font-style: italic;">V</span>
            and mask <span style="font-style: italic;">M</span>.&nbsp;
            A pattern is similar to a breakpoint, except that it uses
            the instruction code rather than the program counter.&nbsp;
            In other words, execution is halted upon finding that the
            instruction code is equal to the value <span
              style="font-style: italic;">V</span>.&nbsp; The
            instruction code is logically bitwise-ANDed with the mask <span
              style="font-style: italic;">M</span> prior to the
            comparison, so that only selected fields in the instruction
            code are really used.&nbsp;</li>
