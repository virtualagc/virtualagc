These source-code files were transcribed from a printout in Don Eyles's personal
collection, scanned by archive.org, and financially sponsored by Peter McDermott.
A team of volunteers performed the transcription and proof-reading.  The scanned
page images are available at
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/Sunburst37/">
the Virtual AGC Project website</a>, as well as higher-quality (but much larger)
images at <a href="https://archive.org/details/sunburst37shepat00miti">
