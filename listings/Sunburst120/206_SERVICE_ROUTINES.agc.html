These source-code files were transcribed from scans made from Don Eyles's personal
copy of BURST120 (SUNBURST 120).  They were scanned at archive.org's Boston 
facility, and the scanning was sponsored by Mike Stewart.  The code was transcribed
from these scans by a team of volunteers who are referenced in the program 
comments.  Comments from the original source code are in ALL-CAPS, whereas 
comments added later in transcription are in Mixed-Case.  In some cases, where
similar code blocks exist in previously-transcribed AGC programs (primarily
Luminary 99, from Apollo 11) those code blocks were used as a starting point and
then corrected to agree with the BURST120 scans.  The full scans are available
at <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/virtualagcproject/">the Virtual AGC
project's collection at archive.org</a>, while more-convenient reduced-size (but reduced-quality)
images are available at <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/Sunburst120/">
the main Virtual AGC website</a>.  Report any errors noted by creating an 
issue report at <a href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/issues">the Virtual AGC
project's GitHub repository</a>. Notations on the program listing read, in part:<br>

The next 10 lines were printed on only 2. I'm not sure the exact distribution, but it seems likely that they
were split evenly between the two. They were disassembled from the octal section, with help from the symbol
table. For the first line, I have chosen DELVX rather than DELV to match SERVICER207 in Colossus 237.
Fragments of comments were also printed on the second line. They read:
"   O UE    T [DP] [P.]      M"
where characters in brackets were printed on top of each other. In place of the original comments, I have 
transplanted comments from the SERVICER207 section of Colossus 237, which closely mirrors this. They roughly
align with the the above string, and so are likely close to correct.

The next six lines were printed on only two (or maybe three, the header is also garbled). They have
been disassembled from the octal listing and symbol table. A few comment fragments made it through
on the last garbled line. They read:
" HRUS   IS  K   R S    H  DV M  I  R"
A single-word comment was pulled in from Sunburst 37/Shepatin 0. Given other context, the above
letters are likely part of something like "THRUST IS OK -- RESET <something> DV MONITOR"
