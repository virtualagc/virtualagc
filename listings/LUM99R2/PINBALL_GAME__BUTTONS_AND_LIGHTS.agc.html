This is an attempt to recreate Luminary 99 Rev 2, otherwise known as LUM99R2,
from Luminary 99 Rev 1 and ephemeris data from Luminary 116. The differences
are confined to the last 10-12 lines of the CONTROLLED CONSTANTS. Luminary 99 Rev 1
source-code was transcribed from a printout in the MIT Museum, while Luminary 116
source code was transcribed from a printout belonging to Don Eyles.  AGC developer
James Kernan, the "rope mother" for the Apollo 11 Lunar Module's AGC, explains as
follows: "At the last minute, Dan Lickly, our chief engineer, appeared with 
ephemerides updates and it took two tries to get it right.  The result was that 
we created Lum99 Revision 1 and Lum99 Revision 2." It is suspected that the former
is what's in the MIT Museum, and the latter is what we are trying to recreate here.
As for which revision actually flew in Apollo 11, all of the <i>other</i> available
surviving evidence points to Rev 1 rather than to Rev 2, so we're just not sure!

Ram&oacute;n Alonso, one of the original AGC developers, provides a 
little more insight:  Apparently, nobody had yet arrived at any kind 
of software requirements for the AGC's user interface when the desire
arose within the Instrumentation Laboratory to set up a demo 
guidance-computer unit with which to impress visitors to the lab.  
Of course, this demo would have to <i>do</i> something, if it was going to be 
at all impressive, and to do something it would need some software. In 
short order, some of the coders threw together a demo program, 
inventing and using the verb/noun user-interface concept (in the 
whimsical fashion seen in much of this code), but without any idea 
that the verb/noun concept would somehow survive into the flight 
software.  As time passed, and more and more people became familiar 
with the demo, nobody got around to inventing an improvement for the 
user interface, so the coders simply built it into the flight software 
without any specific requirements to do so.<br>
<br>
However, that does not mean that the verb/noun interface was universally 
beloved.  Ram&oacute;n says that <i>many</i> objections were received from 
naysayers, such as "it's not scientific", "it's not dignified", or 
even "astronauts won't understand it".  Even though the coders of 
the demo hadn't seriously intended the verb/noun interface to be used 
in any permanent way, it became a kind of devilish game to counter 
these objections with (perhaps) sophistic arguments as to why the 
interface was really a good one.  In the end, the coders won.  I don't 
know whether they were elated or dismayed by this victory.<br>
<br>
The astronauts, of course, <i>could</i> understand the interface, 
but they did not like it.  Most of them really wanted an interface much 
more like that they had used in aircraft:  i.e., lots of dials and 
switches.  Dave Scott is the the only astronaut I'm aware of who had 
kind words for it (or for the AGC in general), though we are told that 
Jim McDivitt wasn't necessary completely hostile to it.<br>
