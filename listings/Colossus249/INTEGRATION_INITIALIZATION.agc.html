This is the source-code for the Apollo 9 Command Module's Guidance Computer.
These files were derived originally from the scan from MIT's Dibner Institute's 
now-discontinued website titled "History of Recent Science and Technology", which
in turn was originally created by Gary Neff, though his high-quality scans were
unfortunately reduced in legibility when presented online.
The markings on the front of the
printout imply that it was the original AGC developer Norm Brodeur's copy.  
A scan by Ron Burkey has superceded it, made from a more-legible copy from the collection of original
AGC developer Fred Martin.  The source code was transcribed from
those images by Ron Burkey.  Note that the page images 
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/Colossus249-Martin/">
presented online</a> are of reduced quality, and that higher-quality images 
are available.  Report any conversion errors or legibility 
problems in page images to info@sandroid.org.
