# PROGRAM NAME- DOWN TELEMETRY PROGRAM
# MOD NO.- 0		TO COMPLETELY REWRITE THE DOWN TELEMETRY PROGRAM AND DOWNLINK ERASABLE DUMP PROGRAM FOR THE
#			PURPOSE OF SAVING APPROXIMATELY 150 WORDS OF CORE STORAGE.
#			THIS CHANGE REQUIRES AN ENTIRELY NEW METHOD OF SPECIFYING DOWNLINK LISTS.REFER TO DOWNLINK
#			LISTS LOG SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS. HOWEVER THIS CHANGE WILL NOT AFFECT THE GROUND PROCESSING
#			OF DOWN TELEMETRY DATA.
# MOD BY- KILROY, SMITH, DEWITT
# DATE- 02 OCT 67
# AUTHORS- KILROY, SMITH, DEWITT, DEWOLF, FAGIN
# LOG SECTION- DOWN-TELEMETRY PROGRAM
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION- THIS ROUTINE IS INITIATED BY TELEMETRY END
#	PULSE FROM THE DOWNLINK TELEMETRY CONVERTER. THIS PULSE OCCURS
#	AT 50 TIMES PER SEC(EVERY 20 MS) THEREFORE DODOWNTM IS
#	EXECUTED AT THESE RATES. THIS ROUTINE SELECTS THE APPROPRIATE
#	AGC DATA TO BE TRANSMITTED DOWNLINK AND LOADS IT INTO OUTPUT
#	CHANNELS 34 AND 35. THE INFORMATION IS THEN GATED OUT FROM THE
#	LGC IN SERIAL FASHION.
#	THIS PROGRAM IS CODED FOR A 2 SECOND DOWNLIST. SINCE DOWNRUPTS
#	OCCUR EVERY 20 MS AND 2 AGC COMPUTER WORDS CAN BE PLACED IN
#	CHANNELS 34 AND 35 DURING EACH DOWNRUPT THE PROGRAM IS CAPABLE
# 	OF SENDING 200 AGC WORDS EVERY 2 SECONDS.
# CALLING SEQUENCE- NONE
#	PROGRAM IS ENTERED VIA TCF DODOWNTM WHICH IS EXECUTED AS A
#	RESULT OF A DOWNRUPT.  CONTROL IS RETURNED VIA TCF RESUME WHICH
#	IN EFFECT IS A RESUME.
# SUBROUTINES CALLED- NONE
# NORMAL EXIT MODE- TCF RESUME
# ALARM OR ABORT EXIT MODE- NONE
# RESTART PROTECTION:
#	ON A FRESH START AND RESTART THE 'STARTSUB' SUBROUTINE WILL INITIALIZE THE DOWNLIST POINTER(ACTUALLY
#	DNTMGOTO) TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT DOWNLIST(I.E. CURRENT CONTENTS OF DNLSTADR). THIS HAS THE
#	EFFECT OF IGNORING THE REMAINDER OF THE DOWNLIST WHICH THE DOWN-TELEMETRY PROGRAM WAS WORKING ON WHEN
#	THE RESTART(OR FRESH START) OCCURRED AND RESUME DOWN TELEMETRY FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT
#	DOWNLIST.
#	ALSO OF INTEREST IS THE FACT THAT ON A RESTART THE AGC WILL ZERO DOWNLINK CHANNELS 13, 34 AND 35.
# DOWNLINK LIST SELECTION:
#	THE APPROPRIATE DOWNLINK LISTS ARE SELECTED BY THE FOLLOWING:
#	1. FRESH START
#	2. V37EXXE WHERE XX = THE MAJOR MODE BEING SELECTED.
#	3. UPDATE PROGRAM(P27)
#	4.	NON-V37 SELECTABLE TYPE PROGRAMS(E.G. AGS INITIALIZATION(SUNDANCE,LUMINARY) AND P61-P62
#		TRANSITION(COLOSSUS) ETC.).
# DOWNLINK LIST RULES AND LIMITATIONS:
#	READ SECTION(S) WHICH FOLLOW 'DEBRIS' WRITEUP.
# OUTPUT- EVERY 2 SECONDS 100 DOUBLE PRECISION WORDS(I.E. 200 LGC
#	COMPUTER WORDS) ARE TRANSMITTED VIA DOWNLINK.
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED- NONE
#	'DNTMGOTO' AND 'DNLSTADR' ARE INITIALIZED BY THE FRESH START PROGRAM.
# DEBRIS(ERASABLE LOCATIONS DESTROYED BY THIS PROGRAM)-
#	LDATALST,DNTMBUFF TO DNTMBUFF +21D,TMINDEX,DNQ.

# DODOWNTM IS ENTERED EVERY 20 MS BY AN INTERRUPT TRIGGERED BY THE
# RECEIPT OF AN ENDPULSE FROM THE SPACECRAFT TELEMETRY PROGRAMMER.
#
# NOTES REGARDING DOWNLINK LISTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM:
# 1.	DOWNLISTS. - DOWNLISTS MUST BE COMPILED IN THE SAME BANK AS THE
#	DOWN-TELEMETRY PROGRAM. THIS IS DONE FOR EASE OF CODING, FASTER
#	EXECUTION.
# 2.	EACH DOWNLINK LIST CONSISTS OF A CONTROL LIST AND A NUMBER OF
#	SUBLISTS.
# 3.	A SUBLIST REFERS TO A SNAPSHOT OR DATA COMMON TO THE SAME OR OTHER
#	DOWNLINK LISTS.  ANY SUBLIST CONTAINING COMMON DATA NEEDS TO BE
#	CODED ONLY ONCE FOR THE APPLICABLE DOWNLINK LISTS.
# 4.	SNAPSHOT SUBLISTS REFER SPECIFICALLY TO HOMOGENOUS DATA WHICH MUST BE
#	SAVED IN A BUFFER DURING ONE DOWNRUPT.
# 5.	THE 1DNADR FOR THE 1ST WORD OF SNAPSHOT DATA IS FOUND AT THE END
#	OF EACH SNAPSHOT SUBLIST, SINCE THE PROGRAM CODING SENDS THIS DP WORD
#	IMMEDIATELY AFTER STORING THE OTHERS IN THE SNAPSHOT BUFFER.
# 6.	ALL LISTS ARE COMBINATIONS OF CODED ERASABLE ADDRESS CONSTANTS
#	CREATED FOR THE DOWNLIST PROGRAM.
#	A.	1DNADR			1-WORD DOWNLIST ADDRESS.
#		SAME AS ECADR, BUT USED WHEN THE WORD ADDRESSED IS THE LEFT
#		HALF OF A DOUBLE-PRECISION WORD FOR DOWN TELEMETRY.
#	B.	2DNADR - 6DNADR		N-WORD DOWNLIST ADDRESS, N = 2 - 6.
#		SAME AS 1DNADR, BUT WITH THE 4 UNUSED BITS OF THE ECADR FORMAT
#		FILLED IN WITH 0001-0101.  USED TO POINT TO A LIST OF N DOUBLE-
#		PRECISION WORDS, STORED CONSECUTIVELY, FOR DOWN TELEMETRY.
#	C.	DNCHAN			DOWNLIST CHANNEL ADDRESS.
#		SAME AS 1DNADR, BUT WITH PREFIX BITS 0111.  USED TO POINT TO
#		A PAIR OF CHANNELS FOR DOWN TELEMETRY.
#	D.	DNPTR			DOWN TELEMETRY SUBLIST POINTER.
#		SAME AS CAF BUT TAGGED AS A CONSTANT. USED IN CONTROL LIST TO POINT TO A SUBLIST.
#		CAUTION--- A DNPTR CANNOT BE USED IN A SUBLIST.
# 7.	THE WORD ORDER CODE IS SET TO ZERO AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DOWNLIST (I.E. CONTROL LIST) AND WHEN
#	A '1DNADR TIME2' IS DETECTED IN THE CONTROL LIST(ONLY).
# 8.	IN THE SNAPSHOT SUBLIST ONLY, THE DNADR'S CANNOT POINT TO THE FIRST WORD OF ANY EBANK.
#
# DOWNLINK LIST RESTRICTIONS:
# (THE FOLLOWING POINTS MAY BE LISTED ELSEWHERE BUT ARE LISTED HERE SO IT IS CLEAR THAT THESE THINGS CANNOT BE
# DONE)
# 1.	SNAPSHOT DOWNLIST:
#	(A) CANNOT CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING ECADRS (I.E. 1DNADR'S): 0, 400, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2400, 3000, 3400.
#	(B) CAN CONTAIN ONLY 1DNADR'S
# 2.	ALL DOWNLINKED DATA(EXCEPT CHANNELS) IS PICKED UP BY A <DCA<SO DOWNLINK LISTS CANNOT CONTAIN THE
#	EQUIVALENT OF THE FOLLOWING ECADRS(I.E. IDNADRS): 377, 777, 1377, 1777, 2377, 27777, 3377, 3777.
# 	(NOTE: THE TERM EQUIVALENT ' MEANT THAT THE IDNADR  TO 6DNADR  WILL BE PROCESSED LIKE 1 TO 6 ECADRS)
# 3.	CONTROL LISTS AND SUBLISTS CANNOT HAVE ENTRIES = OCTAL 00000 OR OCTAL 77777

## Page 989
# 4.	THE '1DNADR TIME2' WHICH WILL CAUSE THE DOWNLINK PROGRAM TO SET THE WORDER CODE TO 3 MUST APPEAR IN THE
#	CONTROL SECTION OF THE DOWNLIST.
# 5.	'DNCHAN 0' CANNOT BE USED.
# 6.	'DNPTR 0' CANNOT BE USED.
# 7.	DNPTR CANNOT APPEAR IN A SUBLIST.
#
# EBANK SETTINGS
#	IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING THE EBANK(WHEN PICKING UP DOWNLINK DATA) THE DOWN TELEMETRY PROGRAM PUTS
#	'GARBAGE' INTO BITS15-12 OF EBANK. HUGH BLAIR-SMITH WARNS US THAT BITS15-12 OF EBANK MAY BECOME
#	SIGNIFICANT SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE. IF/WHEN THAT HAPPENS, THE PROGRAM SHOULD INSURE(BY MASKING ETC.)
#	THAT BITS 15-12 OF EBANK ARE ZERO.
#
# INITIALIZATION REQUIRED- TO INTERRUPT CURRENT LIST AND START A NEW ONE..
#	1. ADRES OF DOWNLINK LIST INTO DNLSTADR
#	2. NEGONE INTO SUBLIST
#	3. NEGONE INTO DNECADR

# SUBROUTINE NAME- DNDUMP
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION - TO SEND (DUMP) ALL 8 BANKS OF ERASABLE STORAGE TWICE.  BANKS ARE SENT ONE AT A TIME
#	EACH BANK IS PRECEEDED BY AN ID WORD, SYNCH BITS, ECADR AND TIME1 FOLLOWED BY THE 256D WORDS OF EACH
#	EBANK. EBANKS ARE DUMPED IN ORDER(I.E. EBANK 0 FIRST, THEN EBANK1 ETC.)
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE- THE GROUND OR ASTRONAUT BY KEYING V74E CAN INITIALIZE THE DUMP.
#	AFTER KEYING IN V74E THE CURRENT DOWNLIST WILL BE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED AND THE DOWNLINK ERASABLE DUMP
#	WILL BEGIN.
#	ONCE INITIATED THE DOWNLINK ERASABLE DUMP CAN BE TERMINATED (AND INTERRUPTED DOWNLIST REINSTATED) ONLY
#	BY THE FOLLOWING:
#	1.	A FRESH START
#	2.	COMPLETION OF BOTH COMPLETE DUMPS
#	3.	AND INVOLUNTARILY BY A RESTART.
# NORMAL EXIT MODE- TCF DNPHASE1
# ALARM OR ABORT MODE- NONE
# *SUBROUTINES CALLED- NONE.
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED-
#	NONE
# DEBRIS- DUMPLOC, DUMPSW, DNTMGOTO, EBANK AND CENTRAL REGISTERS
# TIMING-	TIME(IN SECS) = ((NO.DUMPS)*(NO.EBANKS)*(WDSPEREBANK + NO.IDWDS)) / NO.WDSPERSEC
