This is a reconstruction of the AGC program Luminary 99 Rev 0. It was the
second release of the Lunar Module flight software targeted for use in Apollo 11, after Luminary 97.
A bug (which had been around since at least Apollo 10, Luminary 69) was
discovered in Rev 0 shortly before the Apollo 11 flight, resulting in a last minute
revision into <a href="../Luminary099/MAIN.agc.html">Rev 1</a>, 
which is what actually flew rather than
the Rev 0 presented here.  A hardcopy of Rev 0 is known to
exist &mdash; it belonged to AGC developer Allan Klumpp for many years &mdash; but
unfortunately the Virtual AGC Project has not had access to that hardcopy.  Thus
the code you see here had been reconstructed (we believe accurately) rather than
transcribed.  The first step of the reconstruction of the Rev 0 source code was
the transcription of the Rev 1 source code from a hardcopy in the MIT Museum collection.
The process of reverting the active portion of the source code (i.e., other than
program comments) from Rev 1 to Rev 0 was very minor, consisting 
only of moving the position of the STARTSB1 label in <a href="FRESH_START_AND_RESTART.agc.html">
FRESH START AND RESTART</a>.  Allan had previously given
us the checksums of the memory banks of Rev 0, and we have verified the program presented here has checksums
identical to all banks of Allan's listing of Rev 0.  The notations on Allan's Rev 0 program listing read, 
in part:<br>

<br>
A single program comment is known to differ between Rev 0 and Rev 1, but these are
harder to reconstruct and verify than changes to the active portion of the code.  Thus
it is possible that there are additional differences between the program comments
in Rev 0 and Rev 1 that are unknown to us, and therefore are not reflected in the code
presented here.

Ram&oacute;n Alonso, one of the original AGC developers, provides a 
little more insight:  Apparently, nobody had yet arrived at any kind 
of software requirements for the AGC's user interface when the desire
arose within the Instrumentation Laboratory to set up a demo 
guidance-computer unit with which to impress visitors to the lab.  
Of course, this demo would have to <i>do</i> something, if it was going to be 
at all impressive, and to do something it would need some software. In 
short order, some of the coders threw together a demo program, 
inventing and using the verb/noun user-interface concept (in the 
whimsical fashion seen in much of this code), but without any idea 
that the verb/noun concept would somehow survive into the flight 
software.  As time passed, and more and more people became familiar 
with the demo, nobody got around to inventing an improvement for the 
user interface, so the coders simply built it into the flight software 
without any specific requirements to do so.<br>
<br>
However, that does not mean that the verb/noun interface was universally 
beloved.  Ram&oacute;n says that <i>many</i> objections were received from 
naysayers, such as "it's not scientific", "it's not dignified", or 
even "astronauts won't understand it".  Even though the coders of 
the demo hadn't seriously intended the verb/noun interface to be used 
in any permanent way, it became a kind of devilish game to counter 
these objections with (perhaps) sophistic arguments as to why the 
interface was really a good one.  In the end, the coders won.  I don't 
know whether they were elated or dismayed by this victory.<br>
<br>
The astronauts, of course, <i>could</i> understand the interface, 
but they did not like it.  Most of them really wanted an interface much 
more like that they had used in aircraft:  i.e., lots of dials and 
switches.  Dave Scott is the the only astronaut I'm aware of who had 
kind words for it (or for the AGC in general), though we are told that 
Jim McDivitt wasn't necessary completely hostile to it.<br>
