These source-code files were transcribed from scans made from Don Eyles's personal
copy of Luminary 069.  They were scanned at archive.org's Boston 
facility, and the scanning was sponsored by Onno Hommes.  The code was transcribed
from these scans by a team of volunteers who are referenced in the program 
comments.  Comments from the original source code are prefixed with a single '#' symbol, 
whereas comments added later are prefixed by "##" or "###".  In some cases, where
similar code blocks exist in previously-transcribed AGC programs (primarily
Luminary 99, from Apollo 11) those code blocks were used as a starting point and
then corrected to agree with the Luminary 69 scans.  The full scans are available
at <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/virtualagcproject/">the Virtual AGC
project's collection at archive.org</a>, while more-convenient reduced-size (but reduced-quality)
images are available at <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/Luminary069/">
the main Virtual AGC website</a>.  Report any errors noted by creating an 
issue report at <a href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/issues">the Virtual AGC
project's GitHub repository</a>. Notations on the program listing read, in part:<br>

Ram&oacute;n Alonso, one of the original AGC developers, provides a 
little more insight:  Apparently, nobody had yet arrived at any kind 
of software requirements for the AGC's user interface when the desire
arose within the Instrumentation Laboratory to set up a demo 
guidance-computer unit with which to impress visitors to the lab.  
Of course, this demo would have to <i>do</i> something, if it was going to be 
at all impressive, and to do something it would need some software. In 
short order, some of the coders threw together a demo program, 
inventing and using the verb/noun user-interface concept (in the 
whimsical fashion seen in much of this code), but without any idea 
that the verb/noun concept would somehow survive into the flight 
software.  As time passed, and more and more people became familiar 
with the demo, nobody got around to inventing an improvement for the 
user interface, so the coders simply built it into the flight software 
without any specific requirements to do so.<br>
<br>
However, that does not mean that the verb/noun interface was universally 
beloved.  Ram&oacute;n says that <i>many</i> objections were received from 
naysayers, such as "it's not scientific", "it's not dignified", or 
even "astronauts won't understand it".  Even though the coders of 
the demo hadn't seriously intended the verb/noun interface to be used 
in any permanent way, it became a kind of devilish game to counter 
these objections with (perhaps) sophistic arguments as to why the 
interface was really a good one.  In the end, the coders won.  I don't 
know whether they were elated or dismayed by this victory.<br>
<br>
The astronauts, of course, <i>could</i> understand the interface, 
but they did not like it.  Most of them really wanted an interface much 
more like that they had used in aircraft:  i.e., lots of dials and 
switches.  Dave Scott is the the only astronaut I'm aware of who had 
kind words for it (or for the AGC in general), though we are told that 
Jim McDivitt wasn't necessary completely hostile to it.<br>
