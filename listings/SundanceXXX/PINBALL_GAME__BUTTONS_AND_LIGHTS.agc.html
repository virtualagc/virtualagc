These source code files are a reconstruction of Sundance, the Apollo 9 LM (Lunar Module) AGC
(Apollo Guidance Computer) flight software, created from binary dumps of original core rope
program modules, as follows:
<ul>
<li>B1 &mdash; Revision 292</li>
<li>B2 &mdash; Revision 302</li>
<li>B3 &mdash; Revision 302</li>
<li>B4 &mdash; Revision 302</li>
<li>B5 &mdash; Revision 292</li>
<li>B6 &mdash; Revision 306</li>
</ul>

This means that source code
does not represent a specific historical revision of Sundance, but rather a mixture of the
three released versions. Nonetheless, it is capable of flying the whole Apollo 9 mission.
This source code matches the binary dumps, as closely as feasible, but 100% match is not possible, 
due <i>mostly</i> to changes in memory addresses at which code and variables were allocated in 
different revisions of Sundance.  Refer to 
<a href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/SundanceXXX/SundanceXXXDifferences.txt">
<u>this list of explanations for each binary mismatch</u></a>.
<br><br>
Since only binary dumps (rather than listings) of Sundance are available as source material, 
all comments and labels are approximate.
They have been taken from other AGC programs where possible, or, in some places, written
from scratch to match what we believe would have been in the original listing.

Ram&oacute;n Alonso, one of the original AGC developers, provides a 
little more insight:  Apparently, nobody had yet arrived at any kind 
of software requirements for the AGC's user interface when the desire
arose within the Instrumentation Laboratory to set up a demo 
guidance-computer unit with which to impress visitors to the lab.  
Of course, this demo would have to <i>do</i> something, if it was going to be 
at all impressive, and to do something it would need some software. In 
short order, some of the coders threw together a demo program, 
inventing and using the verb/noun user-interface concept (in the 
whimsical fashion seen in much of this code), but without any idea 
that the verb/noun concept would somehow survive into the flight 
software.  As time passed, and more and more people became familiar 
with the demo, nobody got around to inventing an improvement for the 
user interface, so the coders simply built it into the flight software 
without any specific requirements to do so.<br>
<br>
However, that does not mean that the verb/noun interface was universally 
beloved.  Ram&oacute;n says that <i>many</i> objections were received from 
naysayers, such as "it's not scientific", "it's not dignified", or 
even "astronauts won't understand it".  Even though the coders of 
the demo hadn't seriously intended the verb/noun interface to be used 
in any permanent way, it became a kind of devilish game to counter 
these objections with (perhaps) sophistic arguments as to why the 
interface was really a good one.  In the end, the coders won.  I don't 
know whether they were elated or dismayed by this victory.<br>
<br>
The astronauts, of course, <i>could</i> understand the interface, 
but they did not like it.  Most of them really wanted an interface much 
more like that they had used in aircraft:  i.e., lots of dials and 
switches.  Dave Scott is the the only astronaut I'm aware of who had 
kind words for it (or for the AGC in general), though we are told that 
Jim McDivitt wasn't necessary completely hostile to it.<br>
