This source code is very close to the Apollo Guidance Computer software for the 
Apollo 13 Lunar module.  This revision of the Luminary 131 program is from December
of 1969, whereas there was a later revision in January of 1970, and still another
revision in February, which is the code that flew on the mission.
As far as this transcription is concerned, it was originally from a copy made in 1991 of 
a printout from the collection of AGC developer Don Eyles for collector David Craig.
It was subsequently scanned by Gary Neff, reprocessed for online 
presentation at the now-discontinued History of Recent Science and Technology (HRST) website
of MIT's Dibner Institute (the full-quality scans being discarded in the process),
and finally transcribed by Ron Burkey for the Virtual AGC Project.  Although a
high-quality replacement scan for a completely illegible page was later provided by Gary
Neff, the reduced legibility of the reprocessed HRST posting nevertheless caused many 
errors to be introduced into the transcription.  Accordingly, a second scan of the same physical
printout was made in 2017 for the Virtual AGC Project's collection at the Internet Archive,
and used to correct the transcription errors. All of the scanned materials mentioned,
as well as other Luminary 131 related material, are <a href="../../Luminary.html#Luminary131">available online</a>.
Don Eyles apprently made additional hand-written notes in printout between 1991 and 2017,
so the two scans are not identical in that respect. The page-headings in the printout read, in part:<br>
<pre>
	GAP:  ASSEMBLE REVISION 131 OF AGC PROGRAM LUMINARY BY NASA 2021112-091
	17:53 DEC. 19, 1969
</pre>
Note that the date is the date the printout was made, not the date on which the program
revision was released, although these happen to be very close together.
