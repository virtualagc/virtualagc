These source-code files are part of a reconstructed copy of Comanche 051, the
original release of the Apollo 11 Command Module (CM) Apollo Guidance Computer
(AGC) software. 
<br><br>
The reconstruction began with source code of Comanche 055 previously transcribed
from a digitized copy of that program.  The code was then updated by undoing
changes related to the R-2 lunar potential model, using hints from program
comments and change-indicating asterisks in the Comanche 055 listing as a guide.
The reconstruction was verified by matching memory-bank checksums to those listed
in drawing 2021153D. Note that page numbers in the reconstructed code match those
on the Comanche 055 printout, although the added code would likely have changed page
numbers for a real Comanche 051 listing.
<br><br>
Comments from the original source code are prefixed with a single '#' symbol, 
whereas comments added later are prefixed by "##" or "###".  Report any errors 
noted by creating an 
issue report at <a href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/issues">the Virtual AGC
project's GitHub repository</a>.
