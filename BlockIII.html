    <h2><a name="Blocks_for_All_Occasions" id="Blocks_for_All_Occasions"></a>Blocks


      for All Occasions</h2>
    <p>The design of the AGC went through several stages, which for the
      sake of this discussion we'll call "blocks".&nbsp; However, the
      different block designs, while similar in many ways, were quite
      different in others.&nbsp; Rather than try to cover all of them on
      one page, the different blocks are covered in separate pages:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="NARA-SW/E-1077.pdf">"Block 0"</a> — Earliest
        preliminary design of the AGC for which I have any
        documentation, not used in any missions, and with no known
        existing code.&nbsp; There's a single document (that I know of)
        describing it, so the link is simply to that document, rather
        than to a separate page.</li>
      <li><a href="Block1.html">"Block 1"</a> — Used for the earlier
        designs of the Command Module, which were also referred to a
        Block 1 spacecraft.&nbsp; Used for the unmanned Apollo 4 and
        Apollo 6 unmanned missions.</li>
      <li><a href="assembly_language_manual.html">"Block 2"</a> — Used
        for the later designs of the Command Module, which were also
        referred to a Block 2 spacecraft.&nbsp; Used for the (unmanned)
        Apollo 5 mission's Lunar Module, and for all manned missions.</li>
      <li>"Block 3" — There was no such thing in the Apollo program, but
        Hugh Blair-Smith has given us some ideas about what it might
        have looked like if there were.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, <i>this</i> page confines itself just to the Block 3
      design.<br>
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
    <h2><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a><big><big><big><font size="-1"><big><big><big>Introduction</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></h2>
    <p>The first thing to understand about the Block III AGC is that
      there's no such thing.&nbsp; However, if you have had the patience
      to read much of what we have to say on this site about the
      architecture of the Block I AGC (used only in a handful of
      unmanned missions) and especially the Block II AGC (used in all
      the manned missions), you will see that certain aspects of the
      architecture seem to have led to related inefficiencies in the
      software, and that the system could perhaps have had a
      more-efficient architecture from the ground up.&nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    <p>Of course, in blithely stating that, we shouldn't pretend that
      that fact should have been obvious in advance, nor that there
      weren't inescapable forces that led to this kind of
      situation.&nbsp; For one thing, the "feature creep" (over which
      the developers had no control) on the original development
      project, combined with the need to maintain a certain backward
      compatibility in order to keep from having to rewrite the software
      over and over again, combined too with the inherent multiplicative
      complexity in increasing instruction and memory word-lengths at
      the time, would have forced the team to allow only incremental
      changes to the architecture.<br>
    </p>
    <p>However, that doesn't stop us from speculating about what a
      better Block III system <i>might</i> have looked like, if the
      developers were freed from these kinds of restrictions.&nbsp; But
      as it happens, we don't need to speculate about it!&nbsp; As he
      explains in a footnote in his book, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Left-Brains-Right-Stuff-Computers/dp/0996434534">
        Left Brains for the Right Stuff</a>, original AGC developer Hugh
      Blair-Smith put together some notes for a hypothetical Block III
      AGC architecture that he hoped would have doubled the processing
      speed, and (to quote his words)<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small>"I did the thinking and writing just a few years ago,
          but strictly in terms of the mid-'60s technology we actually
          used. Probably the greatest risk of non-fidelity is in power
          consumption, because I take advantage of the Harvard
          architecture to cycle both fixed and erasable memories
          simultaneously whenever practical (which is mostly)."</small><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And,<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small>"I plan to publish this fantasy on-line for the
          amusement of all the people around the world who enjoy
          building hardware or software replicas of the AGC".</small><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Actually, only the second quote is from the book.&nbsp; While I
      don't know that "enjoy" is the word I would necessarily use for
      this activity, Hugh has in fact sent his notes on the topic to us,
      and we present them here for your delectation.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Hugh's Dream</h2>
    <p>I quote:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small>"What I'd love is for some too-much-time-on-their-hands
          people to port, say, Luminary 099 from Block II to Block III
          and see how much shorter and faster it is!"</small><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    A fascinating idea, obviously.&nbsp; One might wish for not merely a
    port of one or more of the Block II AGC programs, but perhaps even a
    Block III assembler and simulator.&nbsp; If you're such a person,
    give it some thought.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be your road to fame!<br>
    <h2><a name="HughsNotes"></a>Hugh's Notes<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Hugh's current thoughts on the improved architecture, upon which
      he has been working with Bruno Muller, comprise two Word
      documents:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Documents/AGC%20Block%20III%20Overview.docx">AGC
          Block III Overview.docx</a></li>
      <li><a
          href="Documents/AGC%20Block%20III%20Native-Mode%20Instructions.docx">AGC


          Block III Native-Mode Instructions.docx</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also have Hugh's <i>original</i> solo thoughts on the
      subject, which I believe have been completely supplanted by the
      documents listed above.&nbsp; Nevertheless, those original
      thoughts are preserved for posterity below, though <strike>struck
        out</strike> to avoid confusion.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Documents/AGC_Block_III_upd_3.doc"> <strike>AGC
            Block III.doc</strike></a><strike><a
            href="Documents/AGC_Block_III_upd_2.doc"><br>
          </a></strike></li>
      <strike> </strike>
      <li><strike><a href="Documents/AGC_Block_III_testing.doc"> AGC
            Block III testing.doc</a></strike></li>
      <strike> </strike>
    </ul>
    <strike> </strike>
    <p><strike>and since they haven't exactly been put into a finalized
        form, he has also taken the trouble to describe the best way of
        reading them.&nbsp; I quote, though a brief summary might be,
        "Don't start with the testing document":</strike><strike><br>
      </strike></p>
    <strike> </strike>
    <blockquote><strike> </strike>
      <p><strike><small>"... you'll probably find the testing document
            pretty opaque, since it records the output of a simulator
            that existed only in my headbone. In reading the doc, I
            would recommend starting with the general discussions at the
            beginning, then skipping over the NI (Native Interpreter)
            code examples in the middle initially, and going to
            the"regular" interpreter code examples toward the end—the
            idea being to get your head around how Block III performs
            the same kind of interpreter as Block II does. Then dive
            bravely into the NI part to see how it interprets the
            two-word format in RAM of what would otherwise have been
            one-word native instructions in ROM. If you were a
            professor, you could assign a hapless grad student to do
            that! The main reason I spent so much design effort on the
            NI was to make sure the native design could handle it
            without too much ugliness, and I did make several
            enhancements to the native design as a result.<br>
            <br>
            "For relatively short pieces of code, like those in the
            document, it should be possible to have a fairly
            satisfactory experience just writing source code and
            eyeballing it for running time in MCT (as well as for what I
            might call Nortoning)."</small></strike><br>
