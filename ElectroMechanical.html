    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Most of the remainder of this website, other than this page, is
      devoted to the <i>software</i> for the Apollo Guidance Computer
      (the AGC).&nbsp; In various pages of the site we talk a lot about
      the software that ran on the AGC, about the software that
      originally prepared the AGC's flight software software for actual
      use, about the documentation for the AGC's software, about our
      modern open-source replacements for that preparation software,
      about our open-source software for simulating the behavior of the
      AGC and its display/keyboard peripheral (the DSKY), about the
      integration of our AGC simulation software into modern
      spaceflight-simulation software, about the people who originally
      coded the software, and so on.&nbsp; In other words, Software,
      software, software, and then more software, for dessert!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Admittedly, there are a few places on the site where we change
      course a bit to discuss the AGC and DSKY hardware, mainly to
      discuss <a href="Pultorak.html">various people's personal
        projects to make modern hardware recreations of the AGC and/or
        DSKY</a>.&nbsp; All of those efforts derive, in some sense from
      John Pultorak's original attempt to provide a simulation of the
      Block I AGC.&nbsp; But when we provide this material, we don't
      really go into detail, and simply let people speak in their own
      words about whatever they're willing to share, and then direct you
      to their own websites (if any) or caches of photographs or movies
      of their equipment in action.&nbsp; That approach has some
      drawbacks, though, since people may not choose to share their
      design files, may (and usually do) work in some kind of electrical
      or mechanical design environment that's congenial to them but
      which the rest of us don't have the financial resources or
      inclination to duplicate, and of course, <i>never</i> give you
      actual access to their hardware creations; if you want access, you
      have to build one yourself!<br>
    </p>
    <p>On this page, though, we change course quite a lot, and provide a
      <i>lot</i> of resources related to the AGC/DSKY hardware.&nbsp;
      Too much, perhaps!&nbsp; As with our software efforts, of course,
      this is an ongoing effort that will probably never be 100%
      complete.&nbsp; But here, briefly, is what we trying to provide
      for you on this "electro-mechanical" page.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete set of electrical schematics for AGC and DSKY, in the
        form of scanned images of the original Apollo Program drawings.</li>
      <li>Contemporary Apollo Program theory-of-operation documents for
        the above.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Electrically and visually accurate transcriptions of those
        electrical schematics into a modern open-source electrical CAD
        program.</li>
      <li>Translation of AGC electrical design into Verilog
        hardware-description language.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Simulation of the AGC hardware, via modern open-source
        Verilog-simulation software.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once all of this material is in place, so what?&nbsp; Well,
      there's a lot of interesting stuff you can do with it if you're so
      inclined:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having <i>all</i> versions of the electrical schematics, if
        we ever do have them, allows you to see how the AGC hardware
        design changed over time.&nbsp; And by all versions, I mean both
        Block I and Block II.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The transcription into CAD-based schematics gets you the
        following stuff:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Highly legible forms of the schematics to look at (as
          opposed to nasty, smudgy scans of 50-year-old photocopies,
          which is generally the other alternative), color-coded,
          searchable, and with modern notes added to alert you of errors
          in the schematics.</li>
        <li>An easy way to modify the design to a more modern-friendly
          form if you happen to want to build your own hardware
          recreation of the AGC or DSKY.</li>
        <li>A path to laying out your own circuit boards, if you were so
          inclined.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>With a Verilog translation of the design, you could, perhaps
        create an AGC within an FPGA or set of FPGAs.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Simulation of the AGC hardware is a particularly fun
        proposition, since once you can simulate the AGC hardware, you
        can actually run the AGC software on the simulation in a very
        accurate manner (albeit <i>very</i> slowly!), and can look at
        of the AGC's internal (and external) signals to gain a high
        degree of insight into how the AGC actually operated.&nbsp; It
        will impress your friends no end, no doubt!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because this is a work in progress, though, you may not see <i>all</i>
      of this material available just yet.&nbsp; Just have a bit of
      patience.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>What about the mechanical design?&nbsp; After all, I've barely
      mentioned it after first bringing it up.&nbsp; It's just that our
      mechanical effort hasn't advanced very far yet, due to the effort
      poured so far into the electrical effort.&nbsp; The roadmap for
      the mechanical effort will be this, when the time comes:&nbsp;
      provide scans of all original mechanical drawings,
      visually-accurate transcription into some open 2D CAD format
      (probably DXF), and mechanically-accurate reworking into some open
      3D-model format (if/when an appropriate format exists).<br>

    Often, some revision of a drawing which is not part of one of the
    AGC/DSKY assemblies listed on this page, but nevertheless appears in
    the AGC Handbook, is more legible than the corresponding revision we
    are listing here.&nbsp; So it's often useful to look at those other
    revisions of the drawings in additions to the ones we are listing
    here on this page.&nbsp; In the handful of cases in which the same
    drawing appears in both Eldon's and Don's set, the one in Eldon's
    set will typically (but not always) be the more legible one.<br>
    <br>
    Besides these primary sources, there are additional (sometimes
    overlapping) essentially complete electrical schematics available
    in:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>For Block II and LM:&nbsp; <a

        Or, the full-resolution scans (<a

      </li>
    </ul>
    These documents are theory-of-operation documents, which describe
    the circuits textually and often provide useful information like
    timing diagrams of what the circuits do.&nbsp; In the process of
    providing this info, though, they provide the schematics themselves
    in a sequence of figures.&nbsp; In saying that the schematics
    provided in the theory-of-operation documents are "essentially
    complete", what I mean is that the schematics in these volumes
    aren't precisely in the form of the original drawings, but rather
    have been redrafted by AC Electronics to fit into the format of
    their volumes.&nbsp; Thus, they are subject to mistakes (and
    potentially, corrections) by AC Electronics, and cannot necessarily
    be straightforwardly matched to specific drawing numbers or
    revisions.&nbsp; On the other hand, the authors of those manuals had
    access to much more legible versions of the electrical schematics
    than some of ours, whereas our scans of the manuals are terrific, so
    the manuals can often be used to resolve some text that's too smudgy
    to read otherwise.<br>
    <br>
    Surprisingly, while we have schematics in one form or another for
    all AGC/DSKY modules, though not necessarily in all of the different
    forms or versions we like, and we have wiring diagrams for the DSKY
    backplane into which its modules are inserted, we do <i>not</i>
    have wiring diagrams for the AGC backplane.&nbsp; (See <a
      href="#Basic_Partitioning_of_the_AGC">this section</a> for a
    discussion of how the AGC circuitry is partitioned up.)&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, we do have enough information about it to be useful,
    compiled by two techniques:&nbsp; Firstly, the the electrical
    schematics for the individual circuit modules list "net names" for
    all of the connector pins going from the module to the backplane, so
    we do know how the modules were interconnected on the backplane;
    secondly, physical AGCs can have their backplanes mapped by means of
    continuity checking with an ohmmeter.&nbsp; Mike Stewart has put
    together <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/agc_hardware/blob/block2/delphi.db">a
      helpful sqlite database</a> and <a
      href="http://apolloguidance.computer/pins">an interactive, online
      form of it</a>, based on mapping out the backplane for AGC s/n 14.<br>
    <br>
    Other such alternate or partial AGC/DSKY schematics <i>may</i> be
    available in <a href="links.html#AGC_electrical_schematics">the
      "AGC electrical schematics" section of our document-library page</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Besides the AGC Handbook, additional information used for
    cross-referencing the various drawings to specific AGC or DSKY part
    numbers and/or serial numbers came from a couple of sources:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Section 3.7 of the <a

          Labs Final Report on Contracts NAS9-153 and NAS9-4065</a> can
        be used to relate many AGC and DSKY serial numbers to the
        specific missions (or in some cases, other purposes) for which
        they were used.&nbsp; In some cases, there is a discrepancy
        between these two documents (e.g., which DSKYs were assigned to
        LM-10), in which case the latter document was chosen to be
        authoritative.<br>

    <h1><a name="Versioning"></a>Versioning the AGC and DSKY<br>
    </h1>
    "Versions" of the AGC and DSKY? Huh?&nbsp; This is not a concept
    mentioned elsewhere on the site, other than the fact that there were
    earlier "Block I" and later "Block II" versions of everything.<br>
    <p>Well, like the AGC's software, the AGC's hardware (electrical and
      mechanical design) evolved over time.&nbsp; For example, not all
      AGC electrical schematics are created equal ... you have to know
      which specific AGC model number you're interested in, since its
      electrical schematics and mechanical configuration may be
      different than other AGC models.&nbsp; There were a <i>lot</i> of
      different versions of the AGC over time.&nbsp; The same comment
      goes for DSKY units (and other components as well, though we won't
      concern ourselves with any of them).&nbsp; The good news is that
      the changes were prior to any actual missions, and mostly didn't
      affect software, so there was much less variation in electrical
      design from mission to mission than there was for the software
      design.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The AGC and DSKY part-numbering scheme looked like this:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER-DASHNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, Block II AGCs had <i>PARTNUMBER</i>s 2003100,
      2003200, and 2003993, with <i>DASHNUMBER</i>s like -011, -021,
      -031, and so on.&nbsp; <i>REVISION</i>s were letter codes, such
      as A, B, C, etc., or else a dash (-) for "no revision".&nbsp; For
      example,<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>2003200-011A<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Given a part number for a particular AGC (or DSKY) model, the
      part number then relates to a set of sub-assemblies (often
      represented by electrical schematics or mechanical drawings), many
      of which are circuit modules, which themselves may have varying
      versions over time, and have part-numbers like<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, the AGC with p/n 2003200-011A contained, among other
      things, an "oscillator module" which fit into a backplane socket
      labeled B7, and which itself had a p/n 2005003E ... and naturally,
      we have drawing 2005003E if you want to see it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Sadly, in most cases, though with some happy rare exceptions, we
      don't presently have enough information to actually tell you which
      versions of every AGC or DSKY flew on which missions.&nbsp; Oddly,
      even though we don't know their part numbers, we <i>do</i> have
      enough information to know which <i>serial numbers</i> of AGC and
      DSKY units flew on which missions.&nbsp; That information is given
      in an <a href="#AGC_or_DSKY_Part_Numbers_vs_Serial">Appendix</a>.&nbsp;





































































































      <br>
    </p>
    <p>In general, we think that all Block II missions flew with <i>some</i>
      variant of AGC p/n 2003993-<i>xxx</i> and DSKY p/n 2003994-<i>xxx</i>,
      but irritatingly we presently have only partial drawing sets for
      part numbers 2003993 and 2003994!&nbsp; Whereas we have <i>complete</i>
      drawing sets for the earlier Block II AGC part numbers (2003100
      and 2003200) and DSKY part numbers (2003985 and 2003950).&nbsp;
      This would naturally lead one to ask how great the differences
      were between all these different AGC part numbers?&nbsp; Well,
      Mike Stewart has put together a nice, little list of the
      differences we're aware of; I quote him:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">Changes from AGC p/n 2003100 to 2003200: <br>
        </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Conversion from aluminum trays (the X on the
            tray B cover, as depicted in most drawings) to magnesium
            trays (with the grid on the tray B cover).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of dedicated "expander gates" to
            replace all of the blue-nose gates in the 2003100 design,
            whose power pins were left disconnected. There was a diode
            sneak path in the dual NOR gate integrated circuit that
            manifested in these blue nose gates, that added significant
            coupling between the two gates in a chip, and added
            excessive load to some nets. The custom expander gates had
            the resistor from the power pin to the outputs removed,
            which achieved the same effect, but the diode sneak path was
            still there, and it needed to be reverse-biased to keep it
            from affecting anything. So a new power rail, called "FAP",
            was added (shorted to +4VDC in both power supplies), that
            kept constant power applied to all of these gates, even
            during standby.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of wiring to allow the "STBY" key
            on the DSKY to be used as "PRO". I tested for such wiring in
            the AGC I was examining, and it wasn't there, so I'm
            guessing this capability wasn't ported back to any 2003100
            computers.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of additional diodes in the fixed
            and erasable memory drivers, which helped with thermal
            stability.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a resistor/diode feedback path
            to get rope memory working (these components were hacked
            across the backplane, in the yellow sleeves in Tray B, for
            the AGC I was examining).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a capacitor in the erasable
            memory module that allowed the exact timing of the sense
            amplifier strobe to be adjusted. As far as I can tell, two
            extra pins were physically added to the erasable memory
            module for this, since there are no such spare pins in
            2003100 erasable modules.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Switching of the potting compound used in
            the erasable memory module. There was a problem where the
            original compound allowed two much movement of the cores,
            which was leading to some of the wires breaking internally.
            (I may be wrong about the timing of this one; it may have
            been between 2003200 and 2003993, or maybe even later than
            that).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a dedicated 26.5 Volt supply for
            the DSKY to the two power supply modules.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Some changed resistor configurations in the
            alarms module, again for thermal stability.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Also somewhere in here, the tuning resistors
            in the interface modules were changed, to adjust the number
            of counts at max deflection of the RHC/ACA in the LM from 32
            to 42. I'm guessing that was probably between 2003100 and
            2003200, but I'm not completely sure.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="-1">Changes from AGC p/n 2003200 to 2003993:<br>
        </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Removal of the 26.5 Volt supply for the DSKY
            that had been added in 2003200 (I still don't know what this
            was supposed to be for).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Updates to support the Auxiliary Memory Unit
            being developed at Raytheon, which would give the AGC access
            to an external core memory stack and tape module. These
            updates include wiring to some spare NOR gates (and possibly
            the population of those NOR gates, if they chips were
            omitted from the boards), and wiring a new Monitor signal,
            MAMU (Monitor Auxiliary Memory Unit), to the test connector
            A52.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a test connector cover that
            grounded all of the Monitor inputs (this change was
            backported all the way back to 2003100 AGCs).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Rerouting of the SCAFAL wire in the Tray B
            backplane to eliminate noise coupling into it.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Switching to a new diode, or something like
            that?</font></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In particular, it sounds like the biggest change from AGC p/n
      2003200 to 2003993 was the support for the Raytheon Auxiliary
      Memory Unit.&nbsp; <a href="Luminary.html#Superjob">Over on our
        LUMINARY page, we actually have a complete AGC program whose
        purpose is exercising and testing this very Auxiliary Memory
        Unit</a>.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Auxiliary Memory Unit was
      neither installed nor used on actual missions, so I think you'd be
      justified in believing that the 2003200 AGC is pretty close to
      being a 2003993 AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In other words, with few exceptions, most Block II AGC software
      that we have should run on any of the Block II AGC/DSKY models to
      which we're likely to be able to get.&nbsp; Similarly, though Mike
      doesn't address it above, the same is true of the Block I AGC
      software we have and the Block I AGC electrical schematics we
      have.<br>

    <h1><a name="CAD_Files_and_Images"></a>CAD Files and Images</h1>
    <p>In addition to providing scans of original electrical and
      mechanical drawings from the Apollo program, there is an ongoing
      effort to transcribe these drawings into CAD files.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Such CAD transcriptions are made as faithfully visually to the
      original as is feasible, given the capabilities of the CAD program
      involved, as long as there is no compromise of electrical or
      mechanical correctness.&nbsp; But realize that transcription is a
      human effort, so transcribed CAD files may at first contain
      errors; conversely, they may from time to time correct errors
      present in the original drawings — naturally, though, with
      suitable notes indicating that the change had been made, and
      why.&nbsp; It has also been possible occasionally to reconstruct
      some currently-missing drawings from the original Apollo Program.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Help in proof-reading CAD vs the original drawings is welcomed,
      and you can contact me directly at the address at the bottom of
      this page if you're interested.&nbsp; This does not require using
      CAD or having expert electrical knowledge.&nbsp; It just involves
      comparing two images like the ones below and seeing how they
      differ from each other (click to enlarge):<br>

    <p>No mechanical drawings have yet been transcribed to CAD, so I
      presently have no thoughts to pass along to you about it, or even
      know what CAD system will be used.&nbsp; (I can assure you,
      though, that it will be open-source, free-of-charge software, as
      opposite to some undoubtedly-better, proprietary, expensive
      software.) </p>
    <p>As far as electrical CAD files are concerned, though, the
      open-source <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad
        electrical-design software</a> is used.&nbsp; It is available,
      for free of course, on Windows, Mac OS X, and all of the major
      flavors of Linux.&nbsp; The electrical schematics which have been
      transcribed into CAD, or are in the process of being transcribed,
      are stored in <a
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/schematics">the






























































































        "schematics" branch of our GitHub repository</a>. <br>
    </p>
    <p>There's plenty of online material to help you get started with
      KiCad, if you're inclined to do anything more with the CAD files
      as such.&nbsp; Here's the executive summary of what you need to
      know if you want to specifically work with our electrical
      schematics in KiCad:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's best to use the <i>nightly build</i> of KiCad (presently
        v6) rather than a stable version of it (presently v4 or v5), to
        stay as up-to-date as possible with respect to the bug reports
        we file.</li>
      <li>What you find in our GitHub repository for any given
        transcribed drawing is the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A folder called Schematics/<i>DRAWINGNUMBER</i>/ containing
          the files for the drawing.&nbsp; For example, the CAD files
          for drawing 2005912B are in Schematics/2005912B/.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A KiCad project file called module.pro, which you will need
          to open.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>Once the project is open, you can run the schematic editor
          (eeschema) from KiCad's menu.&nbsp; The schematic page that
          opens up will <i>usually</i> look like 2 (or 1 or 3)
          rectangular blocks.&nbsp; Each of the rectangular blocks
          represents one of the original sheets of the drawing.&nbsp;
          Just double-click on one of the blocks to see the schematic
          for that page. <br>
        </li>
        <li>We use a grid size of 25 mils within the schematics.&nbsp;
          You should set the grid size to 25 mils and stay with it.</li>
        <li>Similarly, in the preferences, set the default line width to
          20 mils.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Many of the drawings consist largely of open-collector
          3-input NOR gates and oval-shaped pads, neither marked on the
          schematics with reference designators, so you may need to rely
          on notes within the schematic to know what's what.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>All of the symbol libraries for eeschema used in our CAD
        drawings are <i>custom</i> libraries, and no standard KiCad
        libraries are used.&nbsp; If you find that symbols are missing
        in the schematics you load, you'll have to maneuver through
        KiCad's menu system to individually enable all of the libraries
        needed.&nbsp; These are the *.lib files in the GitHub
        repository.&nbsp; There are a lot of them, primarily because of
        visual and power-supply variations the schematics need for the
        dual NOR-gate part; the main library, exclusive of the NOR
        gates, is AGC_DSKY.lib.</li>
      <li>You may also get warnings when loading a schematic about the
        library versions having changed and asking if you want to
        "recover" any symbols.&nbsp; The answer is that you do <i>not</i>
        want to recover any of them, which at the present time means you
        will need to uncheck the boxes next to every symbol it offers to
        recover for you.</li>
      <li>There's a lot of more-detailed information that may be useful
        in the repository's <a

    <p>Surprisingly, digital simulation of the electronics turns out not
      to be incredibly difficult.&nbsp; Nevertheless, discussion of the
      topic can be rather involved, so to keep this page relatively
      short (really!), <a href="Verilog.html">a separate page is
        devoted to discussing digital simulation</a>.<br>

      of the AGC Electronics<br>
    </h1>
    <p><i>(This section is under construction, is incomplete, and is
        very likely full of really dumb errors.)</i><br>
    </p>
    <p>The Block II or LM AGC contains two trays of electronics, the
      A-tray and the B-tray.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img src="SF9-PopulatedTrayA.jpg" alt=""
        width="1398" height="869"></div>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The trays contain connectors allowing A to be connected to B, or
      vice-versa, and to the outside world.&nbsp; Each tray also
      contains a "backplane" into which electronics modules can be
      plugged.&nbsp; The A-tray modules have designations like A1, A2,
      ..., A31, while the B-tray modules have designations like B1, B2,
      ..., B17.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img src="SF9-PartiallyExposedTrayB.jpg" alt=""
        width="1137" height="570"></div>
    <p>Each of these modules has an associated drawing.&nbsp; For
      example, in the 2003200-011 AGC, module A1 (the "scaler" module)
      has electrical drawing 2005259A.&nbsp; In other words, each module
      is considered to comprise a single circuit, with a unique (though
      possibly multi-sheet) drawing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Modules A1 - A24 consist entirely of "logic": i.e., their
      electrical drawings consist entirely of NOR-gates and the
      connectors for plugging the modules into the
      backplane.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, I suppose, the
      drawings aren't called "schematics", but are given the special
      name "LOGIC FLOW DIAGRAMS".&nbsp; But they're schematics
      anyway.&nbsp; Modules A25 - A31 and B1 - B17 are entirely analog
      in nature and are specifically called "SCHEMATICS".<br>
    </p>
    <p>As far as the construction of the circuitry is concerned, three
      basic techniques were intermixed:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logic-flow module (A1 - A24) construction changed over time:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Early 2003100 AGCs: The components of a module were
          partitioned into 4 "quadrants", and the components of each
          quadrant were mounted on a multilayer nickel ribbon.&nbsp; The
          4 ribbons themselves were also interconnected at various
          strategic spots.&nbsp; This design proved not to work properly
          because of excessive interconnection delays due to the
          properties of the ribbon, though as far as I know, the design
          was basically sound in other respects and should still work if
          a better interconnection technique is used.<br>
        </li>
        <li>2003993, 2003200, and later 2003100 AGCs: Each module
          contains two multilayer circuit boards, though I've chosen to
          show you only one of them in the image below.&nbsp; We'd see
          the other one if we flipped the module over.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <div align="center">
      <blockquote><img src="SF9-A1-side.jpg" alt="" width="1338"
          height="270"><br>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Analog modules (A25 - A29, B1 - B17):&nbsp; These used
        so-called "welded cordwood" construction.&nbsp; What that means
        is that you have a metal block with holes in it, like Swiss
        cheese; the components (such as resistors, capacitors,
        transistors, etc.) are inserted into the holes in the block,
        with their leads protruding from either side.&nbsp; Wires are
        then welded (not soldered) to the leads to interconnect the
        components.&nbsp; In the image below, note the nifty insert
        providing reference designators for the components.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div align="center"><img src="SF9-B8-flip-zoom.jpg" alt=""
        width="1410" height="567"><br>

    </div>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, these details don't matter much in modern terms unless
      you're <i>very</i> enthusiastic about building an AGC recreation
      and want to do it absolutely 100% authentically.&nbsp; If you
      were, you would be defeated in the end by the fact that the
      electronic components originally used, such as the dual
      triple-input NOR gates, are no longer available in precisely the
      form they were originally used.&nbsp; And while I haven't priced
      ferrite memory lately, I expect that it's probably not terribly
      cost-effective.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16"
        height="16">&nbsp; Though, surprisingly, you can get junked
      ferrite-memory systems from eBay; not from the AGC, naturally, but
      perhaps close enough that they could be made to work if mined for
      parts.<br>

            to AGC 1003700, lists drawing 1006550 instead.&nbsp; We
            don't have any scans of 1006560, but we do have several

      2003100-021</h2>
    <p>This is an interesting version of the AGC, in that the logic
      circuitry was constructed in a very different fashion than later
      dash numbers of 2003100 (and the later versions 2003200 and
      2003993) were.&nbsp; Those later versions used multi-layer printed
      circuit boards to hold the integrated circuits, whereas <i>this</i>
      version interconnected them via a nickel ribbon.&nbsp; <a
        href="Documents/HSI-25007.pdf">The nickel-ribbon design turned
        out to have too much capacitance, resulting in excessive signal
        delay, and the design didn't function in practice</a>.&nbsp;
      This is what resulted in the introduction of multi-layer printed
      circuit boards instead.&nbsp; That's not to say, of course, that
      there's anything wrong with the electrical schematics for this
      design, since the physical construction of the circuitry is
      basically outside the scope of the electrical schematics.&nbsp;
      I'm told that all existing functional 2003100 AGC units are of the
      multi-layer printed-circuit variety.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the nickel-ribbon interconnect, the circuitry for
      the various modules was actually divided into four separate
      "quadrants" of circuitry, which were mostly rather independent but
      did have some interaction with each other.&nbsp; Later designs
      removed the concept of quadrants altogether.<br>

        Electronics document ND-1021043 of March 10, 1966</a>,
      supposedly relates to AGC p/n 203100-021 (according to its Tables
      3-I and 7-I), and its Table 8-II lists all of the associated
      module drawings.&nbsp; But I don't believe there are any
      differences between the circuitry it presents and that presented
      by ND-1021042.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In what follows, note that the schematic drawing is all that is
      needed for understanding the electronics as such.&nbsp; Sometimes,
      though, there's also a "signal wiring diagram" listed.&nbsp; These
      are related to the nickel-ribbon interconnect described above. To
      understand what that is and how to read it, consult the <a
        href="#Appendix:_Signal_Wiring_Diagrams">Appendix</a>.&nbsp; It
      should be noted that because of the later reworking of the design
      to replace the nickel-ribbon interconnect with a multi-layer
      printed circuit board, the reference designators and pin numbering
      from later versions is not closely related to numbering of this
      version of the design.<br>

          <td valign="middle">The AGC Handbook, which we usually regard
            as authoritative, calls out drawing 2005252D here, and
            document ND-1021042 (which doesn't specify revision numbers)
            calls out simply 2005252.&nbsp; But you'll notice that what
            we've <i>actually</i> linked to is document 2005052D
            instead.&nbsp; As it happens, we don't have a copy of
            drawing 2005252D to look at, but we do have earlier
            revisions of it, so we have a pretty good notion of what the
            drawing says.&nbsp; It seems <i>unlikely</i> that any
            revision of 2005252 was used in the 2003100, because the
            known revisions of the drawing allow for features (expander
            gates, FAP power input) which were not even present in the
            2003100 AGC.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Currently, we think that what is really meant is drawing
            2005052D.&nbsp; This unfortunately means that <i>both</i>
            the AGC Handbook <i>and</i> document ND-1021042 have
            identical misprints in them, but that's not necessarily
            unlikely, since the data in ND-1021042 was likely extracted
            from the AGC Handbook in the first place.&nbsp; Document
            ND-1021043 Table 8-II does list drawing 2005052 for module
            A7, as would be expected.<br>

            unlike the schematic drawing 2005072C here, <i>explicitly</i>
            shows pin numbers for the NOR-gate inputs and outputs.&nbsp;
            Since the two versions of the A23 module circuitry are
            likely to be very similar, and since the pin numbering is
            one of the two important pieces information you can get from
            the signal wiring diagram, much of what the signal wiring
            diagram provides us can be recovered from that later
            schematic drawing anyway.&nbsp; The other piece of
            information the signal wiring diagram provides, namely which
            of the specific NOR gates are packaged together into
            dual-NOR devices, cannot be recovered from the later
            schematic drawing, and thus currently remains a mystery.<br>

    supplied only the drawings for the A<i>n</i> modules, and not the B<i>n</i>

            since no surviving copy of 2005937 is known.&nbsp; I feel
            pretty confident with this reconstruction, because all known
            drawings of earlier versions of this circuit (2005904B,
            2005904C, and 2005921-) differ only a few resistor and
            capacitor values.&nbsp; Specifically, the only resistor and
            capacitor values that could differ between the real 2005937
            drawing and the reconstructed drawing (namely, R1, R2, and
            C1) are not specified by design anyway, but rather were
            chosen after electrical testing from tables of possible
            substitutions within the drawing itself.&nbsp; It is
            possible for the substitution tables in the reconstructed
            drawing to be <i>incomplete</i>, but I don't think the
            tables could actually be wrong in the sense of containing
            wrong values.<br>
            <br>
            Now, admittedly, the drawing in ND-1021042 is from rev F of
            that document, whereas the 2003993 AGC and 2003994 DSKY were
            first introduced in rev H of the document.&nbsp; So you <i>could</i>
            interpret that as meaning that the drawing in ND-1021042 was
            not current and related to an earlier version of the
            DSKY.&nbsp; Or, you could equally well interpret it as
            meaning that the circuit diagram hadn't changed in the
            2003994 DSKY.&nbsp; The difference between the
            interpretations is in your confidence level of how well AC
            Electronics was doing it's job of documenting the circuitry,
            and you can draw your own conclusions on the matter.<br>

            <br>
            Note, though, that the same rev F vs rev H problem in
            ND-1021042 occurs as for the power-supply module drawing
            2005937 above, and just as for it, you'll need to draw your

    <h1><a name="PartNumbers"></a>Appendix: Evolution of AGC/DSKY Part
      Numbers</h1>
    The way different part numbers of AGCs or DSKYs are related to one
    another is that you start with a given assembly with a certain part
    number (such as Block II AGC with p/n 2003100-011), then you apply
    an Engineering Change Proposal, or ECP for short, such as ECP 322
    (described as "computer wiring changes"), with the result that you
    now have a different assembly p/n 2003100-021.&nbsp; <br>
    <h2>Evolution of Block II AGC Part Numbers</h2>
    The list below shows how all known Block II AGC part numbers are
    interrelated according to the principle just mentioned.&nbsp; Many
    of these changes clearly are not electrical in nature, or else refer
    to intermediate or test versions of the AGC, so to simplify it a
    little bit I've highlighted in <font color="#ff0000">red</font> the
    path (I think) from the earliest Block II AGC to the AGC p/n(s) used
    in flown missions.&nbsp; (Sometimes there are multiple paths to get
    to the same part number, if the ECPs are applied in different
    orders.&nbsp; For example, p/n 2003993-061 + ECP 815 = p/n
    2003993-071 + ECP 719 = p/n 2003993-111.&nbsp; I've only bothered to
    show one such path below in the few cases where that happens.)<br>

    <h1><a name="Appendix:_Index_and_Links_to_all_AGC_"></a> Appendix:
      Index and Links to All Available AGC/DSKY Electro-Mechanical
      Drawings </h1>
    <p>This is primarily a table of direct hyperlinks for individual
      pages of the high-quality scans of the AGC Handbook at our
      Internet Archive site.&nbsp; The table is based on Hartmuth
      Gutsche's index into the reduced-size PDF form of the handbook,
      but note that the page numbers in the PDF start at 1, while those
      at the Internet Archive start at 0, so all of the page numbers
      differ by 1.&nbsp; Where we have transcribed the drawings into CAD
      form, I also give the links to those CAD files as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>However, for completeness, the table also includes links to the
      drawings separately provided by Eldon Hall, and to some of the
      pages in AC Electronics manuals (ND-1021041 or ND-1021042) that
      provide a redrawn versions of the same circuits.&nbsp; (Adding the
      links for the AC manuals is an ongoing effort, and so is only
      partially completed at present.)&nbsp; In the latter case, the AC
      manual itself does not tie the circuits it presents specifically
      to the original drawing numbers or revisions, but in the table
      below but I've indicated the drawings I believe are associated
      with them, by virtue of the fact that the manuals were purportedly
      up-to-date with the latest revisions of the available drawings at
      the time of their release, and that you can associate AGC/DSKY
      part number with those releases.&nbsp; If I think that two
      different revisions of an AC manual apply to the same drawing, I
      provide a link only to the later revision of the AC manual.&nbsp;
      In many cases is it entirely clear where the Hall and AC drawings
      should be inserted into the table below, so I have simply inserted
      them where I felt it was logical to do so.<br>

            electrically accurate (replacing the table with wiring).</td>

    <h1><a name="NARA_Block_I"></a>Appendix: Index to Block I AGC/DSKY
      Electrical Drawings from NARA SW</h1>
    The Block I electrical drawings I've received from NARA SW are in
    the form of a series of PDFs, each of which contain 20 or so
    drawings.&nbsp; Perhaps eventually I'll split these up into
    individually-accessible drawings, but for now I'll just content
    myself by giving you an index that tells how to find each of the
    drawings within these PDFs.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; Unlike the corresponding index to Block II
    drawings in the preceding section, I haven't presently added links
    into document ND-1021041.&nbsp; Refer to the Block I AGC/DSKY
    sections earlier on this page for such links.&nbsp; Similarly, look
    in those sections for transcribed CAD files.<br>

    We don't have an official document, in so far as I am aware, giving
    the Instrumentation Lab's part numbers for electronics components
    like resistors, capacitors, transistors, and so on.&nbsp; Many of
    them are deducible from other documents, like the AGC Handbook
    drawings.&nbsp; For example, from drawing 2005952-, we can find out
    that part number 1006750-32 is a 1/4W 1K resistor with a 2%
    tolerance, while part number 1010406-7 is an 8.2 μH 10% tolerance
    R.F. coil.&nbsp; Mike Stewart (thanks, Mike!) has done a lot of that
    for us, but the task is still incomplete.<br>

    In addition to the raw list of part numbers above, we have the
    Specification Control Drawings (SCDs) for most of them.&nbsp; In
    modern terms you can think of the SCD as being like the data sheets
    for the components, except that instead of being written by the
    manufacturers, they are Instrumentation Lab drawings, and serve
    roughly the same purpose.&nbsp; We have most of the SCDs in multiple
    revisions, so if you're interested in that kind of thing, you can
    see how the specifications evolved over time.&nbsp; At any rate,
    I'll try to get around to indexing all these SCDs one day, or adding
    individual links to the table above, but for now, what you have to
    do is to look in <a href="SCDs">a big folder containing all the
      SCDs for the the "P/Ns" mentioned in the table above</a>.<br>

      Wiring Diagrams for AGC 2003100 and the NOR-Gate Problem<br>
    </h1>
    <p><img alt="" src="typicalCircuitry.png" width="309" height="252"
        align="right">First, an elementary introductory digression, for
      anyone who isn't an electronics expert but has persevered in
      reading to this point.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When designing electronic circuitry, it is customary to assign
      each electrical component in the circuit a unique "reference
      designator" (or "refd", pronounced REF-DEE, for short), and to
      refer to the components by those refd's.&nbsp; The refd's can be
      anything, but customarily they consist of a letter to indicate the
      general type of component — R for resistors, C for capacitors, D
      (or perhaps CR) for diodes, and so on — followed by a number to
      indicate which specific component it is within the circuit.&nbsp;
      For example, in the typical kind of circuit diagram shown to the
      right, you see resistors R1 through R7, capacitor C3, transistors
      Q1 through Q3, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Integrated circuits (IC's) typically have U as the alphabetical
      prefix, thus you might have integrated circuits U1, U2, U3, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>One thing that happens sometimes is that a given component might
      actually be a conveniently packaged-together collection of <i>several</i>
      essentially interchangeable simpler parts.&nbsp; For example, a
      "dual NOR gate" integrated circuit would be a device that provides
      two separate NOR gates, which are independent of each other but
      are packaged together to save space or cost or for some other
      reason of convenience.&nbsp; When that happens, the overall
      integrated circuit still has a U-based refd, perhaps U3, but the
      two NOR-gates comprising it each have refd's of their own, which
      would normally be U3A and U3B.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img
        src="file:///home/rburkey/git/virtualagc-web/SenseAmplifierCircuit.jpg"
        alt="" width="541" height="393" align="right">The example of a
      NOR-gate wasn't chosen arbitrarily. In fact, since integrated
      circuits were a pretty new development during the early Apollo
      Program, and were still suspiciously unreliable and quite
      expensive, the AGC circuitry originally didn't use any of
      them.&nbsp; Eventually, though, the relentless pressure to
      miniaturize forced integrated circuits into the design.&nbsp; As
      it happens, the AGC ended up using a single type of integrated
      circuit (the DSKY used none at all), though it used <i>lots</i>
      of them.&nbsp; As you've probably guessed, that one type of IC was
      in fact a dual triple-input NOR gate.<br>
    </p>
    <p>(Actually, that's a bit of an over-simplification, though it's
      largely true for our purposes.&nbsp; In fact, the Block II AGC
      used dual NOR gate integrated circuits, as stated, but the Block I
      AGC used integrated circuits containing a single NOR-gate
      each.&nbsp; Besides that, the sense amplifier modules used
      comparatively small numbers of sense-amplifier integrated
      circuits, whose internal composition is depicted in the figure to
      the right.&nbsp; The sense amplifier integrated circuit was
      exactly as complex as a dual triple-input NOR gate integrated IC,
      in that each of them contained 6 NPN transistors and 8 resistors
      ... which is just an interesting factoid and is neither here nor
      there.&nbsp; For the purposes of our present discussion, neither
      the Block I NOR gates nor the sense-amplifier ICs are of any
      relevance whatever.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>I won't bore you by telling you about the general properties of
      NOR gates, but to understand the discussion in this section you do
      need to know a couple of different things about them.&nbsp;
      Firstly, in the AGC schematics a NOR gate is symbolized either as<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="NORgates.png" width="244"
        height="43"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div align="left">and secondly, all of the three inputs of a NOR
      gate are interchangeable, in the sense that if you swapped any two
      of them, the behavior of the device would remain the same. (I
      suppose it may also be worth noting that of the two NOR-gate
      representations above, you can have two of the left-hand kind as
      the A and B parts of a dual NOR gate, or two of the right-hand
      kind, but not one of each.)<br>
      <br>
      What this is all leading up to is that some of the early AGC (p/n
      2003100 only) electrical schematic drawings:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Do not list any ref's for NOR-gates, so we have no way of
          knowing from the schematics which individual NOR gate is
          packaged with any other into a dual-NOR IC; and</li>
        <li>Do not list any pin numbers for the NOR-gate inputs, so we
          have know way of knowing which of the interchangeable inputs
          any given input signal is hooked up to.</li>
      </ol>
      <div align="left"><img alt="" src="numberedSchematic.png"
          width="474" height="247" align="right"></div>
      <p>To get a sense of this, to the right there are two versions of
        a sample (nonsense) circuit consisting of NOR gates, one with
        refd's and pin numbers, and one without.&nbsp; In the right-hand
        version, we know, for example, that pin U1A-J is connected to
        pins U1B-F, U2A-F, and U2B-F.&nbsp; In the left-hand version we
        know that the output from one NOR gate is connected to some
        input or other on each of the other NOR gates.&nbsp; Imagine
        trying to repair or discuss the left-hand version!<br>
      </p>
      <p>As far as the operation of the circuit is concerned, of course,
        it makes no difference at all whether or not those refd's or pin
        numbers are there, because all of the NOR gates are
        interchangeable and all of the inputs to them are
        interchangeable, so the OUTPUT we get from any given INPUT is
        still exactly the same.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the same way, you personally may not care one way or the
        other which specific NOR gate is used for any given purpose in
        the AGC circuitry, nor may you care which input pin is which on
        those NOR gates.&nbsp; If that's so, you don't need to read any
        further ... just go back to looking at the schematics presented
        above on this page and enjoy!<br>
      </p>
      <p>But the truth is that the original AGC developers did care
        which NOR gate was which and what pin number was what ... it's
        just that for some reason they didn't find it convenient to put
        that information directly into some of the schematic diagrams
        for AGC p/n 2003100, and hence they chose to provide it through
        some other mechanism.&nbsp; That mechanism is the so-called
        "signal wiring diagram", and each of the schematic drawings in
        the AGC 2003100 containing NOR gates had an associated signal
        wiring diagram.&nbsp; Below, there's a "typical" (actually,
        slightly more legible than usual) portion of a signal wiring
        diagram:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="typicalSignalWiringDiagram.jpg" width="1328" height="645"></div>
      <p>You may be forgiven for thinking that this makes the situation
        even more confusing to deal with, particularly since you are
        quite correct about it, but it helps if you know how to read
        it!&nbsp; When you know how to read it, it tells you which
        NOR-gates are paired into which in the dual NOR-gate IC's, which
        of the pair is the "A" member of the duet and which is the "B"
        member, and which pin numbers the signals are hooked up to.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It doesn't tell you exactly how to specify the refd's of the
        dual-NOR IC's, but we know from other versions of the AGC
        roughly how they did that, so we'll talk about that later.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first thing to notice is that one side of the diagram is
        marked as LEFT and the other as RIGHT.&nbsp; In this drawing,
        LEFT is at the bottom and RIGHT is at the top, but in other
        drawings that's reversed, so try to think only of LEFT and RIGHT
        instead of bottom and top.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Next, notice the little numbers written along the LEFT or
        bottom edge (39155, 39145, 39149, ...) and RIGHT or top edge
        (39156, 19151, 39152, ...).&nbsp; Those numbers are actually
        written on the NOR gates in the schematics, in lieu of refd's,
        and each individual NOR gate is identified uniquely by these
        numbers.&nbsp; These are called "gate numbers".&nbsp; So, a pair
        of such gate numbers could uniquely specify a dual-NOR
        gate.&nbsp; The RIGHT numbers are the "A" NOR gates, and the
        numbers opposite them on the LEFT are the associated "B" NOR
        gates within the same dual NOR IC.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Before talking about the other stuff written on the diagram,
        let's talk a little more about the dual-NOR ICs.&nbsp; The AGC's
        were 10-pin rectangular packages, with the pins on them
        variously labeled either numerically or alphabetically,
        depending on the purpose of the discussion.&nbsp; We might draw
        it like so, with the "A" NOR gate on the left and the "B" NOR
        gate on the right:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dualNOR.png" width="311"
          height="299"></div>
      <p><br>
        Ignore the fact that the NOR gates now look like little rocket
        ships; that may or may not be significant.&nbsp; Rather, the
        important things to note are that there are VCC and GND inputs
        to power the device, that the "A" gate has pins 1-4 (or J, A, B,
        C), and that the "B" gate has pins 6-9 (or D, E, F, K).<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you look along the bottom (LEFT) edge of the signal wiring
        diagram, you'll see a repeating pattern (from left to right)
        consisting of<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>a small square</li>
        <li>an even smaller circle</li>
        <li>3 empty spots</li>
        <li>an oval with a number inside </li>
      </ol>
      <div align="left">What those represent in terms of the dual-NOR IC
        are:<br>
        <div align="center">
          <div align="left">
            <ol>
              <li>pin 10 of the dual-NOR</li>
              <li>pin 9</li>
              <li>pins 8, 7, and 6<br>
              </li>
              <li>a spot unrelated to the NOR</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div align="left">Similarly, along the top (RIGHT) edge of the
            signal wiring diagram, you'll see a similar but slightly
            less regular pattern of 6 positions:<br>
          </div>
          <div align="left">
            <div align="center">
              <div align="left">
                <ol>
                  <li>small circle</li>
                  <li>3 empty spots</li>
                  <li>2 spots with several possible markings</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div align="left">And in terms of the dual-NORs, these
                are:<br>
              </div>
              <div align="left">
                <div align="center">
                  <div align="left">
                    <ol>
                      <li>pin 1 of the dual-NOR</li>
                      <li>pins 2, 3, and 4</li>
                      <li>2 other things not related to the NOR.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                  <div align="left">We'll get to what those non-NOR
                    things are later, but the point to understand right
                    now is that 9 of each dual-NOR's 10 pins appear in a
                    regular manner along these edges.&nbsp; (The 10th
                    pin is always grounded, and we won't worry ourselves
                    about it.)<br>
                  </div>
                  <div align="left"> <br>
                    What about those weird, snake-like horizontal lines
                    running lengthwise along the middle of the signal
                    wiring diagram?&nbsp; Wires!&nbsp; Where the wire
                    points downward, there's a connection along the
                    bottom edge of the diagram, whereas when it points
                    upward there's a connection along the top edge of
                    the diagram.&nbsp; In the image below, I've added
                    some false coloring to just one of those snakelike
                    lines to focus the attention on it:<br>
                    <br>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="coloredSignalWiringDiagram.jpg" width="1328" height="645"></div>
      <p>So according to the description I just gave, the wire makes a
        connection to the following:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOR-gate at location 39155, pin 9 (output of a "B" NOR gate)</li>
        <li>NOR-gate at location 39107, pin 9 (output of a different "B"
          NOR gate)</li>
        <li>An oval with a <i>very</i> smudgy 111 written in it.&nbsp;
          Maybe.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, if you know anything about electronics, you may be worried
        that the outputs of two different NOR gates are tied
        together.&nbsp; Don't worry, though, these NOR-gates have
        open-collector outputs (or more precisely, open-collector with a
        pullup resistor to VCC), and so they can be tied together to
        increase their drive capacity (or to effectively increase the
        number of NOR inputs for a single output) without any problem.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps I should finally say what some of these non-NOR
        markings along the edges are:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A numbered oval is a pin on the connector from the circuit
          to the AGC's backplane.&nbsp; In other words, a signal leaving
          or entering the circuit.</li>
        <li>A pointed box like &lt;VCC&gt; or &lt;0V&gt; is a
          power-supply or ground connection.</li>
        <li>A rectangular box with an alphanumeric label inside of it is
          an "inter-quadrant" connection, and we'll get to that in a
          moment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At any rate, the point is that this red wire represents two
        NOR-gates tied together to drive connector pin 111.&nbsp; Now, I
        didn't mention it before, but this signal wiring diagram happens
        to be from <a href="AGCHandbook/A5-2005061D-1.jpg">sheet 1 of
          drawing 2005061D</a>, and if we look at that drawing, we will
        indeed find that connector pin 111 is being driven by NOR gates
        39107 and 39155.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What is this "inter-quadrant" thing of which I spoke, and for
        that matter, what is a "quadrant" anyway?<br>
      </p>
      <p>For these AGC modules, the connector from the module to the AGC
        backplane has 4 rows of 69 pins each (numbered 1 to 71, but with
        21 and 51 missing).&nbsp; Each one of those rows of pins
        essentially has its own circuit associated with it, and these
        separate circuits are called "quadrants".&nbsp; The concept of
        the "quadrant" was used only for early dash numbers of the
        2003100 AGC (such as the one we have schematics for!), and
        disappeared for later 2003100 versions, and for the 2003200 and
        2003993 AGC's, though much of the numbering of components on the
        schematics remains tied to the quadrant concept even if the
        quadrants themselves disappeared.<br>
      </p>
      <p>By "separate circuits", I mean logically separate rather than
        physically separated onto different circuit boards, though
        apparently that was originally what was tried.&nbsp; And
        usually, the circuitry on the quadrants isn't <i>entirely</i>
        logically independent of the circuitry on the other quadrants,
        and in that case there have to be one or more electrical
        connections between the quadrants of the module ... i.e.,
        inter-quadrant connections.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In fact, the signal wiring diagram I've been showing you isn't
        the complete diagram for drawing 2005061D, but simply the signal
        wiring diagram for quadrant 1 of 2005061D.&nbsp; There are three
        other quadrants, and therefore 3 other signal wiring diagrams
        for this module as well.&nbsp; Most modules have a complete
        complement of 4 quadrants, and thus have 4 signal wiring
        diagrams associated with them.&nbsp; But some module have less
        quadrants and therefore less signal wiring diagrams.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So now all of the questions are answered except for
        refd's.&nbsp; For that, I want to direct your attention just
        above the row of gate numbers at the bottom edge of the signal
        wiring diagram shown above, or just below the row of gate
        numbers along the top edge.&nbsp; You'll see a row of tiny, tiny
        numbers going from 1 (at the left) to 180 (at the right)
        there.&nbsp; Or more accurately, you'll see rows of tiny smudges
        that may or may not be numbers, but you can still see that there
        are 180 of them.&nbsp; Let's call these things "smudge numbers",
        for lack of a better term.&nbsp; The IC's are numbered
        sequentially, starting at the end with the larger smudge
        numbers, where we find U01, and moving toward the end with the
        smaller smudge numbers, where we find U30.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Actually, there's some subtlety involve here.&nbsp; For
        example, what happens if there's an open space, as there is in
        our pictured signal wiring diagram at U23?&nbsp; Should we just
        skip U23 in our numbering altogether, or should the next
        position become U23 rather than U24?&nbsp; You could argue it
        either way, but I'd vote for skipping U23 altogether, because it
        helps preserve IC numbering across different hardware
        versions.&nbsp; In other words, if a dual-NOR is removed or
        added, it won't necessarily cause all of the refd's for the <i>other</i>
        dual-NORs to change.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another subtlety in the IC numbering is the quadrants:&nbsp;
        The entire circuit module consists of 4 quadrants, and if we
        followed the scheme just described, there would be 4 IC's
        labeled U01, 4 labeled U02, and so on.&nbsp; Not good!&nbsp; So
        in our CAD work we actually prefix the quadrant numbers to the
        IC numbering.&nbsp; In other words, in quadrant 1, the IC's run
        from U101 up to U130; in quadrant 2, the IC's run from U201 up
        to U230; etc.&nbsp; Thus every IC ends up with a unique number
        within the module, and we can still use that number to precisely
        identify where it is located physically.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And finally, one last subtlety:&nbsp; Some of the quadrants
        have signal wiring diagrams as shown, with LEFT on the bottom,
        RIGHT on the top, and smudge numbers increasing from left to
        right.&nbsp; Other quadrants are reversed, with LEFT on the
        bottom, RIGHT on the top, and smudge numbers increasing from
        right to left.&nbsp; My descriptions above are all still
        correct, as long as you keep thinking of LEFT and RIGHT and
        ordering of smudge numbers as I've urged, rather than thinking
        of the top, bottom, right, and left edges of the signal wiring
        diagram as you might otherwise be inclined to do.&nbsp; The
        reason for this reversal seems to have to do with some of the
        quadrants being on the <i>front</i> side, and some being on the
        <i>back</i> side, with the numbering consequently mirror imaged.<br>
