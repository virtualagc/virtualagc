    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This page of the Virtual AGC website is very technical, and not
      likely to be of interest unless you are very familiar with
      electronics design.&nbsp; The goal of this page is to present the
      complete electrical schematics and mechanical drawings for every
      major version of the AGC and DSKY units.&nbsp; We don't yet fully
      succeed in doing so.&nbsp; Additionally, there are drawings
      related to various intermediate versions of the AGC and DSKY which
      we point out to you as a resource, but let you digest them for
      yourself if you're interested, rather than trying to do so for
      you.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Versions" of the AGC and DSKY? Huh?<br>
    </p>
    <p>Well, like the AGC's software, the AGC's hardware (electrical and
      mechanical design) evolved over time.&nbsp; For example, not all
      AGC electrical schematics are created equal ... you have to know
      which specific AGC model number you're interested in, since its
      electrical schematics and mechanical configuration may be
      different than other AGC models.&nbsp; There were a <i>lot</i> of
      different versions of the AGC over time, and not just the major
      distinction between Block I and Block II AGCs with which you may
      be familiar.&nbsp; The same comment goes for DSKY units (and other
      components as well, though we won't concern ourselves with any of
      them).&nbsp; The good news is that the changes were prior to any
      actual missions, and mostly didn't affect software, so there was
      much less variation in electrical design from mission to mission
      than there was for the software design.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The AGC and DSKY part-numbering scheme looked like this:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER-DASHNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, Block II AGCs had <i>PARTNUMBER</i>s 2003100,
      2003200, and 2003993, with <i>DASHNUMBER</i>s like -011, -021,
      -031, and so on.&nbsp; <i>REVISION</i>s were letter codes, such
      as A, B, C, etc., or else a dash (-) for "no revision".&nbsp; For
      example,<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>2003200-011A<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Given a part number for a particular AGC (or DSKY) model, the
      part number then relates to a set of sub-assemblies (often
      represented by electrical schematics or mechanical drawings), many
      of which are circuit modules, which themselves may have varying
      versions over time, and have part-numbers like<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, the AGC with p/n 2003200-011A contained, among other
      things, an "oscillator module" which fit into a backplane socket
      labeled B7, and which itself had a p/n 2005003E ... and naturally,
      we have drawing 2005003E if you want to see it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Sadly, in most cases, though with some happy rare exceptions, we
      don't presently have enough information to actually tell you which
      versions of every AGC or DSKY flew on which missions anyway.&nbsp;
      Oddly, even though we don't know their part numbers, we <i>do</i>
      have enough information to know which <i>serial numbers</i> of
      AGC and DSKY units flew on which missions.&nbsp; That information
      is given in an <a href="#AGC_or_DSKY_Part_Numbers_vs_Serial">Appendix</a>.&nbsp;




      <br>
    </p>
    <p>In general, we think that all Block II missions flew with <i>some</i>
      variant of AGC p/n 2003993-<i>xxx</i> and DSKY p/n 2003994-<i>xxx</i>,
      but irritatingly we presently have only partial drawing sets for
      part numbers 2003993 and 2003994!&nbsp; Whereas we have <i>complete</i>
      drawing sets for the earlier Block II AGC part numbers (2003100
      and 2003200) and DSKY part numbers (2003985 and 2003950).&nbsp;
      This would naturally lead one to ask how great the differences
      were between all these different AGC part numbers?&nbsp; Well,
      Mike Stewart has put together a nice, little list of the
      differences we're aware of; I quote him:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">Changes from AGC p/n 2003100 to 2003200: <br>
        </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Conversion from aluminum trays (the X on the
            tray B cover, as depicted in most drawings) to magnesium
            trays (with the grid on the tray B cover).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of dedicated "expander gates" to
            replace all of the blue-nose gates in the 2003100 design,
            whose power pins were left disconnected. There was a diode
            sneak path in the dual NOR gate integrated circuit that
            manifested in these blue nose gates, that added significant
            coupling between the two gates in a chip, and added
            excessive load to some nets. The custom expander gates had
            the resistor from the power pin to the outputs removed,
            which achieved the same effect, but the diode sneak path was
            still there, and it needed to be reverse-biased to keep it
            from affecting anything. So a new power rail, called "FAP",
            was added (shorted to +4VDC in both power supplies), that
            kept constant power applied to all of these gates, even
            during standby.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of wiring to allow the "STBY" key
            on the DSKY to be used as "PRO". I tested for such wiring in
            the AGC I was examining, and it wasn't there, so I'm
            guessing this capability wasn't ported back to any 2003100
            computers.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of additional diodes in the fixed
            and erasable memory drivers, which helped with thermal
            stability.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a resistor/diode feedback path
            to get rope memory working (these components were hacked
            across the backplane, in the yellow sleeves in Tray B, for
            the AGC I was examining).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a capacitor in the erasable
            memory module that allowed the exact timing of the sense
            amplifier strobe to be adjusted. As far as I can tell, two
            extra pins were physically added to the erasable memory
            module for this, since there are no such spare pins in
            2003100 erasable modules.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Switching of the potting compound used in
            the erasable memory module. There was a problem where the
            original compound allowed two much movement of the cores,
            which was leading to some of the wires breaking internally.
            (I may be wrong about the timing of this one; it may have
            been between 2003200 and 2003993, or maybe even later than
            that).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a dedicated 26.5 Volt supply for
            the DSKY to the two power supply modules.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Some changed resistor configurations in the
            alarms module, again for thermal stability.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Also somewhere in here, the tuning resistors
            in the interface modules were changed, to adjust the number
            of counts at max deflection of the RHC/ACA in the LM from 32
            to 42. I'm guessing that was probably between 2003100 and
            2003200, but I'm not completely sure.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="-1">Changes from AGC p/n 2003200 to 2003993:<br>
        </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Removal of the 26.5 Volt supply for the DSKY
            that had been added in 2003200 (I still don't know what this
            was supposed to be for).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Updates to support the Auxiliary Memory Unit
            being developed at Raytheon, which would give the AGC access
            to an external core memory stack and tape module. These
            updates include wiring to some spare NOR gates (and possibly
            the population of those NOR gates, if they chips were
            omitted from the boards), and wiring a new Monitor signal,
            MAMU (Monitor Auxiliary Memory Unit), to the test connector
            A52.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Addition of a test connector cover that
            grounded all of the Monitor inputs (this change was
            backported all the way back to 2003100 AGCs).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Rerouting of the SCAFAL wire in the Tray B
            backplane to eliminate noise coupling into it.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Switching to a new diode, or something like
            that?</font></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In particular, it sounds like the biggest change from AGC p/n
      2003200 to 2003993 was the support for the Raytheon Auxiliary
      Memory Unit.&nbsp; <a href="Luminary.html#Superjob">Over on our
        LUMINARY page, we actually have a complete AGC program whose
        purpose is exercising and testing this very Auxiliary Memory
        Unit</a>.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Auxiliary Memory Unit was
      neither installed nor used on actual missions, so I think you'd be
      justified in believing that the 2003200 AGC is pretty close to
      being a 2003993 AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>More drawings are available than just those presented
      specifically on this page.&nbsp; The full sets of drawings
      available to us at the present time are these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="klabs/history/agc_schematics_block2/">Folder of JPG
          scans of drawings preserved by Eldon Hall</a>.&nbsp; Contains
        most of the available drawings for AGC p/n 2003993<i></i>. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The "AGC Handbook", contributed by Don Eyles.&nbsp; Contains
        most of the drawings for AGC/DSKY part numbers <i>other</i>
        than AGC p/n 2003993.&nbsp; Contains many other drawings than
        just the electrical schematics, including top-level indices,
        mechanical drawings, wiring diagrams, assembly drawings, and
        even software lists.&nbsp; The AGC Handbook scans are available
        in two forms:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="Documents/agc_handbook_jp2.pdf">Reduced-size
            (170MB), reduced-quality PDF hosted locally here at the
            Virtual AGC website</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/agc_handbook_jp2">Full-quality


            scans, hosted on our Virtual AGC project page at the
            Internet Archive</a>.&nbsp; The drawings can be individually
          viewed in full-quality form online there, or else you can
          download the entire set of drawings (4.2GB) in JPEG2000
          format.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    Often, some revision of a drawing which is not part of one of the
    AGC/DSKY assemblies listed on this page, but nevertheless appears in
    the AGC Handbook, is more legible than the corresponding revision we
    are listing here.&nbsp; So it's often useful to look at those other
    revisions of the drawings in additions to the ones we are listing
    here on this page.&nbsp; In the handful of cases in which the same
    drawing appears in both Eldon's and Don's set, the one in Eldon's
    set will be more legible.<br>
    <br>
    Besides these primary sources, there are additional (sometimes
    overlapping) portions of electrical schematics available in <a
      href="Documents/acelectroniclmma00acel_0.pdf">AC Electronics
      manual ND-1021042</a> that haven't (or haven't <i>yet</i>) been
    integrated into this particular framework, but which can be used to
    fill in some gaps in the official schematics of AGC p/n 2003993 and
    DSKY p/n 2003994 that we do have from the sources mentioned
    above.&nbsp; Other such alternate or partial AGC/DSKY schematics may
    be available in <a href="links.html#AGC_electrical_schematics">the
      "AGC electrical schematics" section of our document-library page</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Additional information for used for cross-referencing the various
    drawings to specific AGC or DSKY part numbers and/or serial numbers
    came from a couple of sources:<br>

          Labs Final Report on Contracts NAS9-153 and NAS9-4065</a> can
        be used to relate many AGC and DSKY serial numbers to the
        specific missions (or in some cases, other purposes) for which
        they were used.&nbsp; In some cases, there is a discrepancy
        between these two documents (e.g., which DSKYs were assigned to
        LM-10), in which case the latter document was chosen to be

        href="Documents/apollolunarexcuracel_1.pdf">AC Electronics
        document ND-1021043 of March 10, 1966</a>, supposedly relates to
      AGC p/n 203100-021 (according to its Tables 3-I and 7-I), and its
      Table 8-II lists all of the associated module drawings.&nbsp; So
      we've used some data from that document as well.&nbsp;
      Discrepancies between it and the AGC Handbook are noted in the

          <td valign="middle">The AGC Handbook, which we usually regard
            as authoritative, calls out drawing 2005252D here, and
            document ND-1021042 (which doesn't specify revision numbers)
            calls out simply 2005252.&nbsp; But you'll notice that what
            we've <i>actually</i> linked to is document 2005052D
            instead.&nbsp; As it happens, we don't have a copy of
            drawing 2005252D to look at, but we do have earlier
            revisions of it, so we have a pretty good notion of what the
            drawing says.&nbsp; It seems <i>unlikely</i> that any
            revision of 2005252 was used in the 2003100, because the
            known revisions of the drawing allow for features (expander
            gates, FAP power input) which were not even present in the
            2003100 AGC.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Currently, we think it's more reasonable that what is really
            meant is drawing 2005052D.&nbsp; This unfortunately means
            that <i>both</i> the AGC Handbook <i>and</i> document
            ND-1021042 have identical misprints in them, but that's not
            necessarily unlikely, since the data in ND-1021042 was
            likely extracted from the AGC Handbook in the first
            place.&nbsp; Document ND-1021043 Table 8-II does list
            drawing 2005052 for module A7, as would be expected.<br>

            discrepancy in that document ND-1021042 calls out drawing

            out drawing 2005922A.&nbsp; We believe the AGC Handbook is
            more authoritative (and we don't have a copy of drawing

    <h1><a name="PartNumbers"></a>Appendix: Evolution of AGC/DSKY Part
      Numbers</h1>
    The way different part numbers of AGCs or DSKYs are related to one
    another is that you start with a given assembly with a certain part
    number (such as Block II AGC with p/n 2003100-011), then you apply
    an Engineering Change Proposal, or ECP for short, such as ECP 322
    (described as "computer wiring changes"), with the result that you
    now have a different assembly p/n 2003100-021.&nbsp; <br>
    <h2>Evolution of Block II AGC Part Numbers</h2>
    The list below shows how all known Block II AGC part numbers are
    interrelated according to the principle just mentioned.&nbsp; Many
    of these changes clearly are not electrical in nature, or else refer
    to intermediate or test versions of the AGC, so to simplify it a
    little bit I've highlighted in <font color="#ff0000">red</font> the
    path (I think) from the earliest Block II AGC to the AGC p/n(s) used
    in flown missions.&nbsp; (Sometimes there are multiple paths to get
    to the same part number, if the ECPs are applied in different
    orders.&nbsp; For example, p/n 2003993-061 + ECP 815 = p/n
    2003993-071 + ECP 719 = p/n 2003993-111.&nbsp; I've only bothered to
    show one such path below in the few cases where that happens.)<br>
