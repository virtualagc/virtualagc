      style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> is name of the mission
    software which was run on the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)
    installed in the Lunar Module (LM) in all of the later missions,
    Apollo 10 through 17.&nbsp; Actually, the title of this web-page and
    this section, "Luminary", is a bit of a misnomer, since we don't
    limit ourselves to just Luminary. On this page we present all
    versions of AGC software targeted for the Lunar Module that we can
    get our hands on.&nbsp; The earliest such software had names like <b>Retread</b>,
    <b>Aurora</b>, <b>Sunburst</b>, and <b>Sundance</b>.&nbsp;
    Similarly, there were different programs used for the AGC installed
    in the Command Module (CM), and you should consult <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="Colossus.html">the <b>Colossus</b>
      page</a> for information about those.<br>
    <br>
    In order to be loaded into the AGC — actually, to be converted to
    the "core ropes" within the AGC — it was necessary to "assemble" the
    Lunar Module's software source code into binary machine language,
    using a computer program originally called <b>YUL</b>, and
    eventually superseded by a program called <b>GAP</b>.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In the context of the Virtual AGC project the process is somewhat
    different, since you don't have one of the computers on which <b>YUL</b>
    originally ran, and hence cannot run <b>YUL</b> yourself; nor do
    you (presumably) have an AGC on which to run the assembled
    program.&nbsp; You will instead be able to assemble the Lunar Module
    source code by using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
    program, and then load it into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
    simulation, both of which we provide to you.<br>
    <br>

    If you'd like to see a more comprehensive but less LM-centric
    overview of all the available AGC software source code and the
    manufactured core ropes, you might want to look in the section of
    our <a href="links2.html#AssemblyListings">Document Library</a>
    dedicated to AGC software listings.&nbsp; The diagram to the right
    (click to expand) attempts to show the interrelationships between
    every AGC software version (<b>Luminary</b>, <b>Colossus</b>, or
    otherwise) and every <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="yaAGS.html">AGS</a>
    software version, along with the documentation (Program Change
    Requests, memos, etc.) documenting the changes.&nbsp; It covers
    literally thousands of versions and is therefore very big!
    <h2><a name="Known_Software_Versions" id="Known_Software_Versions"></a>Available














      and Particularly-Desired Lunar Module Software Versions</h2>
    <p>Actually, there are a lot of Lunar Module program versions we
      don't have, and won't ever have.&nbsp; For example, the reason
      Luminary 69 is called 69 is because of the 68 versions preceding
      it, all of which have now vanished with the wind ... we
      presume.&nbsp; The same goes for the documentation associated with
      the software, so we only have incomplete snapshots at various
      points in time, and in the table below I've made an effort to
      associate important version-specific documentation with the
      software version.&nbsp; However, in case of Luminary, we have an
      additional very important resource that I haven't bothered to link
      in on a version by version basis, but which you can nevertheless
      consult.&nbsp; I refer to the so-called <a
        href="links.html#LUMINARY_Memos">LUMINARY Memos</a>, a
      collection of 250+ internal Instrumentation Labs covering many
      aspects of the Luminary development process, including extensive
      descriptions of revision-to-revision changes.&nbsp; Instead of
      trying to isolate which memos are specific to which of the many
      program revisions, I'll just recommend that you browse the memo
      collection yourself as you see fit.<br>

              id="RetreadNutshell"></a>As you've seen elsewhere on this
            site, there where two major versions of the AGC, the Block I
            and Block II models.&nbsp; While there was never any Block I
            code for the Lunar Module, there was certainly Block I code
            for the Command Module, and at some point a transition was
            made both from writing Block I code to writing Block II code
            ... but also from writing CM code to writing LM code, and
            Retread marks that transition point!&nbsp; It's the
            veritable Missing Link of AGC code, which is particularly <i>à
              propos</i> since in fact the YUL development system
            employed for AGC development didn't sport a linker.&nbsp;
            (Joke!&nbsp; Feel free to ignore.)<br>
            <span id="moreRETREAD44" style="display:none"> <br>
              In other words, Retread was when Block I code for the CM
              began to be adapted into Block II code for the LM.&nbsp;
              Thus, like Aurora below, Retread was never intended to be
              mission code, and was never flown.&nbsp; But it has the
              honor of being the "first" LM software.&nbsp; It is, in
              fact, more than a year older than any other AGC software
              of any kind (Block I, Block II, CM, LM) available publicly
              at the present time, as far as I'm aware!<br>
              <br>
              Indeed, if you look at the date on this software — I'll
              save you the trouble; it's July 9, 1965 — that's the same
              time (within a month or two) of when the first Block II
              AGCs were actually becoming available, and thus the only
              way to have run RETREAD at that time was probably in a
              digital simulation.&nbsp; But of course, digital
              simulations in advance of actual hardware are never <i>perfect</i>,
              so there would be every possibility that RETREAD 44 may
              not be exactly compatible with Block II AGC hardware yet
              ... and it turns out that that's the case.&nbsp; If, for
              example, you look at <a
                href="listings/Retread44/AGC_BLK2_INSTRUCTION_CHECK.agc.html">the

                code</a>, run by VERB 21 NOUN 27 ENTER 1 ENTER, not all

            software, not of itself perhaps, but due to the way we
            acquired it.&nbsp; We do not have any assembly listing for
            it (scanned or otherwise), nor has it been reconstructed
            from problem reports and speculations about how it might
            differ from the closely-related RETREAD 44 software above.<br>

                  height="55" border="2" align="left"></a>Rather, this
              software was dumped from physical core-rope modules
              presently living in an AGC at the Computer History Museum
              in Mountain View, California.&nbsp; In other words, what
              was obtained was the <i>executable</i> form of the
              program, and not the source code for it.&nbsp; The source
              code linked at the left was mostly taken from
              corresponding sections of RETREAD 44 source code (see
              above) and AURORA 12 source code (see below), but it
              assembles identically to the contents of the dumped
              core-rope modules, thus validating that the source code is
              correct.&nbsp; <i>Small</i> areas of the source code,
              particularly in memory bank 11, have not yet been matched
              to any preexisting code, and therefore source code for
              those areas was decompiled from&nbsp; the rope, using
              presently-arbitrary program labels and variable names.<br>
              <br>
              One of the Computer History Museum's (two) rope modules
              was defective, but fortunately defective in a way that
              allowed ultimate recovery of the data.<br>
              <br>
              This work was not done by the Virtual AGC Project, but by
              an independent project (leading up the 50th anniversary of
              Apollo 11) to make one of the original remaining AGCs
              operational.&nbsp; The code was then donated by the
              restoration project to us.&nbsp; <a

            developers who you may know as <a
              href="http://www.doneyles.com/LM/Tales.html">the hero of
              Apollo 14</a>, has contributed the hardcopy of this
            program from his personal collection.<br>
            <br>
            Now, for years I had presented this program here as "Aurora
            12".&nbsp; That would make it a very <i>early</i> revision
            of the Aurora program, and that would be somewhat of a
            mystery.<br>
            <span id="moreAURORA12" style="display:none"><br>
              You see, the hardcopy we have is dated November 10, 1966,
              and Aurora at the time should have had a much higher
              revision level than 12.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the only
              two revisions of Aurora we know of that were released to
              manufacturing, Aurora 85 and 88, were released in March
              and July of 1966, respectively, months earlier.&nbsp; So
              how could this only be Aurora 12?&nbsp; Was it just a
              reprinting, for some unknown reason, of a very early
              revision of Aurora?&nbsp; No, it was not; it was a new
              revision on the very day it was printed, which we know
              because of the messages printed by the YUL assembler.<br>
              <br>
              No, the answer is that strictly speaking this is not even
              the true Aurora program at all, either early or late.
              &nbsp; Rather, it is a fork from the main Aurora
              source-code tree made by the Digital Autopilot (DAP)
              Group, apparently for the purpose of developing the
              Sunburst program (see below).&nbsp; Indeed from messages
              printed by YUL, we know that the then-most-recent assembly
              of Sunburst 37 was made on that very same November 10,
              1966.&nbsp; It's unfortunate in a way that the DAP Group
              didn't choose a new name, such as "Papagena", for their
              forked program in order to avoid confusion, rather than
              continuing to call it "Aurora"; on the other hand, if they
              had chosen a new name then perhaps it would have taken
              longer for us to catch on that this really is a variant of
              Aurora. Six of one, half dozen of the other.&nbsp; I have
              unilaterally taken the step of calling it "DAP Aurora".<br>
              <br>
              How do I back up the claim that this program was being
              used for Sunburst development?&nbsp; Well, for one thing,
              there's a lot of (I'm told) very buggy Sunburst code in
              it, all in memory module 4.&nbsp; True Aurora fit entirely
              into memory modules 1 through 3, so true Aurora didn't
              even have a memory module 4, let alone one filled with
              Sunburst code.<br>
              <br>
              All right, then, if we agree that DAP Aurora is very
              "close" to being true Aurora, in that it's basically
              Aurora with extra Sunburst stuff stuck at the end.&nbsp;
              But is it very close to being an <i>early</i> Aurora or
              is it very close to being a <i>late</i> Aurora?&nbsp; The
              answer is that it's close to a very late Aurora, and the
              key to demonstrating that is System Test Group (STG) Memo
              #824.&nbsp; STG Memo #824 is a list of software changes
              that were made to turn Aurora 85 into Aurora 88.&nbsp;
              Some of the changes listed in that memo <i>have</i> been
              made in DAP Aurora, and some <i>have not</i> been
              made.&nbsp; Presumably this could only happen if DAP
              Aurora derived from Aurora 86 or Aurora 87.&nbsp; So it's
              very late, but still has a few bugs relative to the final
              revision of true Aurora, namely Aurora 88.<br>
              <br>
              But enough of that.&nbsp; Let's get back to the provenance
              of our copy of the program.&nbsp; At our request, Don
              Eyles had it scanned by <a href="http://www.archive.org">archive.org</a>,
              and Mike Stewart generously financially sponsored the
              scanning.&nbsp; So, thanks Don and Mike!&nbsp; I suppose I
              should mention that if page 52 or 70 of the images look a
              little weird to you (oh, you conspiracy theorists with
              your Photoshopping theories!), those were places where
              there was a paper-change on the printer. <br>
              <br>
              Now before you go all elitist and thumb your nose at DAP
              Aurora just because it never flew on an actual mission
              (even an unmanned one) — and isn't even "real" Aurora
              anyway — let me tell you that from this project's
              standpoint it is quite a terrific find.&nbsp; For one
              thing, it employs unique flavor of the AGC programming
              language; although it is a Block 2 program for a Block 2
              computer, the language version precedes its final form as
              used in the later software versions we have available,
              requiring changes to the assembler just to assemble
              it.&nbsp; Technically, it was targeted at the "BLK2"
              software architecture rather than the "AGC" software
              architecture.<br>
              <br>
              More significantly, Aurora was the <i>last</i> version of
              AGC code we know of to incorporate the full range of the
              AGC's self-test software.&nbsp; In actual mission
              software, most of this self-test software was removed due
              to size constraints, and due to the fact (I presume) that
              most of the tests were more-appropriately done in the lab,
              as acceptance tests, rather than in space where nothing
              could be done about the failures anyway.&nbsp; Why do we
              care about self-test code?&nbsp; Well, how do you think we
              test our AGC-emulation software?&nbsp; Prior to having
              Aurora, our only choice was to roll our own tests, which
              the even original AGC may not have even been able to pass
              for all we know.&nbsp; But now that we have DAP Aurora,
              which has inherited all of the AGC-testing code inherited
              from true Aurora 86 or 87, we can run the <i>real</i>
              tests.<br>

            SUNBURST rev 37, otherwise known as SHEPATIN rev 0, is an
            early revision of the SUNBURST program, not used in any
            mission.&nbsp; The scan was taken from Don Eyles's personal
            copy, for our Internet Archive collection, and financially
            sponsored by Peter McDermott.<br>
            <span id="moreSUNBURST37" style="display:none"> <br>
              I would hazard the guess that SHEPATIN was a program Don
              used for off-line development of new program features or
              bug fixes for SUNBURST, and that SHEPATIN 0 happened to
              have been branched from SUNBURST 37 ... thus it is a
              "clean" copy in which no changes had yet been made, which
              fortuitously (for us) gives us a nice snapshot of SUNBURST
              development as well.&nbsp; We know that SHEPATIN was
              developed at least through SHEPATIN 6, since the notes at
              the end of the AURORA 12 assembly listing mention assembly
              of SHEPATIN 6.&nbsp; At any rate, whatever the exact
              history, we're obviously we're thrilled that Don saved it
              for us.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              SUNBURST 37 is substantially different from SUNBURST 120
              (see below), used later for Apollo 5, and thus, like
              RETREAD and AURORA (see above) is a kind of missing link
              in the evolutionary chain of the AGC software in general
              and the LGC software in particular.<br>

          <td><a name="Apollo5"></a>Apollo 5 was an unmanned mission to
            test the LM, and as such it had a working AGC, though at
            certain points in the mission the ground controllers
            bypassed the AGC (which hadn't been planned for), using the
            <a href="yaAGS.html">AGS</a> instead for some
            maneuvers.&nbsp; The mission itself was not entirely
            successful.<br>

              The "Programer" — actually some sources spell it
              "programer" and some "programmer" — was a robotic gadget
              that was the stand-in for the crew.<br>

              Don Eyles provided the hardcopy for our the

              In spite of the relative lack of resources about the
              Apollo 5 mission, <a
                href="https://github.com/dseagrav/NASSP">NASSP</a>
              developer and enthusiast Niklas Beug tells us that <br>
              <blockquote><small>... we have successfully been able to
                  fly most of the Apollo 5 mission with that scenario,
                  including two burns with the Descent Propulsion System
                  and one with the Ascent Propulsion System. As you
                  know, &nbsp;during the actual Apollo 5 mission
                  Sunburst didn't actually make it beyond the first DPS
                  burn due to slow thrust buildup and a resulting thrust
                  fail indication. But in NASSP Sunburst has been able
                  to complete the simulated DOI, and the simulated
                  powered descent with a late abort and staging,
                  followed by a short APS burn.</small><br>
              </blockquote>
              Recall that NASSP is an Apollo-mission add-on for the
              Orbiter spaceflight simulator that integrates our AGC
              simulator so that it can run the actual AGC software to
              control the simulated CM or LM.&nbsp; The "scenario" Nik
              is referring to here is, of course, using SUNBURST 120 in
              a simulated LM, but it also involves the trickery employed
              to account for the fact that we have no documentation for
              the pad-loads needed for this mission.&nbsp; What Nik did
              to generate these pad-loads is very interesting, so I'll
              quote him in full:<br>
              <blockquote><small>[In NASSP], we can't currently have a
                  running simulated Lunar Module on the launchpad, due
                  to how NASSP simulates the CSM and Saturn vehicles as
                  one entity. But nothing was stopping me from creating
                  the usual padload worksheet for Sunburst120. Luckily
                  there were a few resources available for that,
                  including the "Prelaunch Erasable Memo Load Definition
                  for AS206" document.</small>
                <div><small><br>
                  </small></div>
                <div><small>But then I wondered if I could at least try
                    Sunburst in NASSP, configured correctly with the
                    padload. So I decided to try and run Sunburst in a
                    CSM on the launchpad, in a scenario for the
                    historical Apollo 5 launch time. Sunburst is
                    special, because it has a lot more in common with a
                    CMC than any other LGC version. Sunburst has a
                    launch monitor program, very similar to the one used
                    in every CMC, It is connected to the Instrument Unit
                    of the Saturn vehicle like a CMC, so Sunburst gets
                    the same input channel signals for liftoff etc. as a
                    CMC. So in that way attempting to run Sunburst in a
                    CSM made a lot of sense.</small></div>
                <div><small><br>
                  </small></div>
                <div><small>... I managed to fly Sunburst120 into Earth
                    orbit, connected to a CSM and on the same trajectory
                    and time as the Apollo 5 mission. I then saved the
                    state of the mission, as usual with Orbiter in a
                    scenario file, and so had the state of the AGC as it
                    would have been during Apollo 5 after Earth orbit
                    insertion. Then I started my Dr. Frankenstein work,
                    by editing the scenario, removing everything of the
                    CSM and Saturn vehicles and replacing it with the
                    state of a Lunar Module that is fully powered up. I
                    only kept the state of the Sunburst erasable memory,
                    IMU alignment etc. in that scenario. And to my
                    suprise Sunburst did not complain that it was
                    suddenly connected to a LM! So I was sucessful in
                    circumventing the limitations of NASSP to create an
                    Apollo 5 scenario, that could be used as the
                    starting point for further tests.</small></div>

            Job, is a very unusual offering, in that it is AGC code not
            written by the MIT Instrumentation Lab, but rather by the
            Raytheon Company.&nbsp; Of course, sub-contractors from
            Raytheon, A.C. Electronics, and others, were used to help
            write the "regular" AGC programs as well, but this program
            is entirely written by Raytheon. In fact, we found program
            listing hidden in an Appendix of a Raytheon report (<a
              moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="Documents/R68-4125-Volume1.pdf">volume 1</a> and <a

              href="Documents/R68-4125-Volume2.pdf">volume 2</a>)
            concerning a potential "auxiliary memory" system for the
            AGC.<br>
            <span id="moreSUPERJOB" style="display:none"> <br>
              Nor does it seem to have been assembled with the YUL or
              GAP assemblers used to assemble all of the other AGC code,
              but rather (as far as we can tell!) an in-house Raytheon
              assembler.&nbsp; That in-house assembler is almost, but
              not quite, compatible with YUL/GAP: slightly different
              address formats were used, and the interpretation of
              certain operands is slightly different.&nbsp; We support
              that with a special command-line switch (--raytheon) in
              yaYUL.<br>
              <br>
              The way this program came about is that Raytheon was
              contracted to do a feasibility study for potentially
              expanding the AGC memory capacity by adding a
              magnetic-tape recorder.&nbsp; If you have looked at <a
                href="Gemini.html">our Gemini OBC (on-board computer)
                page</a>, you'll know that the later Gemini missions did
              use a tape-memory unit to load different OBC software for
              different mission phases, and this is a similar
              idea.&nbsp; The basic characteristics of the auxiliary
              memory were:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>An Auxiliary Core Memory (ACM) consisting of memory
                  cores:&nbsp; Up to 16K 16-bit words, though only 8K×16
                  bits were used in the prototype units Raytheon
                  actually built.</li>
                <li>An Auxiliary Tape Memory (ATM) consisting of
                  magnetic tape (10<sup>8</sup> bits capacity).</li>
                <li>The ability to transfer data from the ATM to the ACM
                  or vice-versa.</li>
                <li>The ACM could be directly accessed in the
                  address-space of the AGC as either "extended fixed
                  memory" or "extended erasable memory" (see Table 2-2
                  in volume 1 of the Raytheon document hyperlinked to
                  the left).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The auxiliary memory was never used in a mission, so
                you may suppose it was a completely-obscure feature, but
                there is actually some measure of legacy support for it,
                albeit very trivial, in every LM code version from
                Sunburst onward.&nbsp; The way its effect is seen is
                that the AGC's so-called "superbit"— the flag in the
                memory-bank register that selects memory banks 40-43 vs
                banks 30-33 — actually consists of 3 bits even though
                single bit is needed.&nbsp; The extra two superbits
                would have been used to select the various
                auxiliary-memory functions mentioned above.<br>
              </p>
              <ul>
              </ul>
              The rationale for the auxiliary memory was that as
              "feature creep" (or perhaps "feature explosion") occurred
              during AGC development, more and more memory was required,
              surpassing the physical resources of the AGC itself.&nbsp;
              Many "<a href="http://www.tindallgrams.net">Tindallgrams</a>"
              cover this, and indeed, very significant AGC features were
              developed in software and then simply discarded due to
              memory constraints.&nbsp; For example, code was developed
              for the LM for something called a Lunar Optical Rendezvous
              System (LORS) that could potentially have been used in
              place of the Rendezvous Radar (RR).&nbsp; However, the
              code for LORS was larger (much larger) than the code for
              the RR, thus causing it to be eliminated, so the only
              place it exists today is as a vague reference in a
              Tindallgram.&nbsp; I wish we could see the code for LORS,
              but we cannot.&nbsp; Perhaps if Raytheon's auxiliary tape
              memory for the AGC had eventually been adopted, we might
              be able to do just that!&nbsp; But the tape memory was <i>not</i>
              adopted, so we cannot.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Actually, the story I've been told (by MSC's Clark Neily)
              is that there was an intense dispute (which he labeled The
              Rendezvous Wars) between the optical camp (led by Max
              Faget) and the radar camp.&nbsp; You can read Clark's
              extended comments about it in <a
                href="links.html#Miscellaneous_Mission_Documents">our
                document library</a>.&nbsp; The radar camp won for
              Apollo, but lost for the shuttle.&nbsp; Such is life!<br>
              <br>
              At any rate, Super Job is a test program for this
              tape-drive system.&nbsp; While we provide the transcribed
              source code for SuperJob, it's probably not too useful to
              run it in the AGC simulator as of yet; probably the tape
              drive itself will have to be simulated as well, perhaps
              with a new program that might be named yaTape.&nbsp; Or
              not; we'll have to wait and see.&nbsp; It's also worth
              noting that the scanned program listing is rather wimpy in
              places, and has no niceties such as memory-bank checksums
              to give us confidence that the transcription of the source
              code is correct ... but we hope (and think) it probably
              is.<br>
              <br>
              And finally, as you may have realized, there is actually <i>no</i>
              logical reason for including Super Job here on the
              Luminary page.&nbsp; There's nothing in the documentation
              suggesting that it would be installed in the LM vs the
              CM.&nbsp; Rather, it's just a generic concept that might
              apply to either spacecraft, or to both of them.&nbsp; But
              it has to go somewhere, so here it stays!<br>

            <span id="moreSUNDANCE306" style="display:none"> <br>
              Here is some info from James Kernan, one of the LGC
              developers, in response to a question from me about about
              correct versioning of Sundance:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <small>Sundance 306 is
                  correct.&nbsp; I was the "rope mother" for
                  Sundance-Apollo 9.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; Sundance was not
                  only the Apollo 9 LM flight program, it was also the
                  development bed for the Lunar orbit and landing
                  software.&nbsp; At some point we created a version and
                  called it Luminary.&nbsp; I think the last few
                  revisions of Sundance were devoted to disabling crew
                  access to the Lunar orbit and landing software that
                  was present in the build.<br>
                </small> </div>
              <br>
              Jim also tells me that a copy of Sundance 306 may still
              "be in the building".&nbsp; I'm not certain which building
              he's talking about, but it's nevertheless interesting news
              that a copy of the program does exist somewhere.<br>
              <br>
              Not being "in the building" ourselves, <i>we</i> have no
              copies of the full Sundance 306 program, nor of any other
              revision of Sundance source code.&nbsp; Annoying!&nbsp;
              Nevertheless, we <i>do</i> have quite a bit of access to
              Sundance software.&nbsp; What do I mean by that cryptic
              statement?&nbsp; Well, within the AGC itself, Sundance (or
              any other AGC program) physically resided in executable
              form, in up to 6 core-rope modules, denoted as modules B1
              through B6.&nbsp; Various individual Sundance physical
              rope modules have shown up in private collections and
              auction sites, and Mike Stewart has sometimes been able to
              dump their contents using <a href="Restoration.html">Jimmy



















                Loocke's restored AGC</a>.&nbsp; While these disparate
              dumped modules do not form a complete set of software for
              any one Sundance revision, they are tantalizingly close to
              doing so.<br>
              <br>

                href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/SundanceXXX">Mike's



















                dumps of the individual Sundance modules reside in our
                GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp; Here's a complete list of
              the modules for which we have dumps, and of the personal
              collections whence they originally came:<br>

              </ul>
              <p>But how to fit them together to make something
                usable?&nbsp; In case you're wondering, <i>perhaps</i>
                they could just magically be compatible with one
                another, so that you could simply stick they modules
                into an AGC which you happen to have in your garage and
                have them work correctly.&nbsp; Well, you should
                disabuse yourself of that hope:&nbsp; These revisions of
                the core-rope modules are&nbsp; not compatible enough to
                provide a working Sundance program when you try using
                them together.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Quite the puzzle!<br>
              </p>
              <p>With some assistance from Nik Beug, Mike has been
                trying to piece together this puzzle by <i>reconstructing</i>
                Sundance 306 from these binary dumps and other existing
                material.&nbsp; If Mike succeeds, it would be quite a
                coup, since we already have the Apollo 9 CM software
                (Colossus 249).&nbsp; Thus if we had Sundance 306 as
                well, we would have the <i>complete</i> Apollo 9
                mission software.<br>
              </p>
              <p>This software reconstruction turns out (surprise!) to
                be quite difficult, and is not yet complete, but the
                effort has been rewarded with great success.&nbsp; It is
                a 3-phase process:<br>

            LUM69R2, and the revision for which we actually have scans
            (see the item above) as LUM69.&nbsp; The reason for calling
            it "LUM69" rather than continuing to call it "LUMINARY" is
            that originally it was branched off of LUMINARY at LUMINARY
            69, so that development for Apollo 11 could continue with
            LUMINARY 70, LUMINARY 71, and so forth, while separate
            development for Apollo 10 continued with LUM69 rev 1 and
            LUM69 rev 2.&nbsp; In other words, strictly speaking, this
            is not LUMINARY 69 rev 2 — there's no such thing! — but
            rather LUM69 rev 2.&nbsp; And if we had contemporary
            printout of the program, the tops of the pages would say
            "REVISION 002 OF PROGRAM LUM69".<br>
            <span id="moreLUMINARY69REV2" style="display:none"> <br>
              How is such a reconstruction even possible?&nbsp; Well,
              Mike Stewart did the reconstruction, and <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n68/mode/1up">has



















                explained it in quite a bit of detail</a>.&nbsp;
              However, I'll try to give you a relatively brief
              overview.&nbsp; There are 4 key ingredients:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>We know the <i>checksums</i> of all of LUM69R2's
                  memory banks, because they are listed in the
                  recently-discovered engineering drawing
                  2021152B.&nbsp; From this and other documentation,
                  there is a high degree of confidence that the contents
                  of only 2 of the 36 memory banks have changed from
                  LUM69.</li>
                <li>We have LUMINARY Memo #75, which <i>describes</i>
                  what those changes ought to be.</li>
                <li>We have LUMINARY Memo #78, which describes a similar
                  change in Luminary 95 source code.</li>
                <li>We have the Luminary 99 source code, which derives
                  from Luminary 95.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>With all of that at our disposal, the appropriate
                changes in Luminary 99 can be back-ported to Luminary
                69, and then the fact that we know the LUM69R2 checksums
                means we can check that the back-ported changes do
                indeed produce the proper bank checksums.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As a cross-check, Nik Beug has flown the reconstructed
                software in the Orbiter/NASSP Apollo 10 simulation, and
                reports that it works as expected.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So in conclusion, we're pretty sure we do have the
                LUM69R2 software for Apollo 10, <i>without</i> ever
                having been given the assembly listing for the software!

            We do not have physical program listings for any of them,
            but their source code has been reconstructed from other
            available data, and we are confident that these
            reconstructions are correct.<br>
            <span id="moreLUMINARY9678" style="display:none"> <br>
              How can we be confident of that?&nbsp; Mike Stewart
              performed the reconstruction and has provided a detailed
              explanation (<a
                href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/pull/1078">Luminary

                96 here</a>).&nbsp; In brief, we have known-good source
              code for Luminary 99 (see below).&nbsp; <a
                href="Documents/LUM85_text.pdf">LUMINARY memo #85</a>
              describes the differences between Luminary 99 and 98, so
              we can use that information to reconstruct Luminary 98
              from 99.&nbsp; Similarly, <a
                href="Documents/LUM83_text.pdf">LUMINARY memo #83</a>
              describes the differences between Luminary 98 and 97, so
              that allows reconstruction of Luminary 97 from 98.&nbsp;
              As far as Luminary 96 is concerned, the <a
                href="Documents/LNY-59.jpg">software anomaly report
                LNY-59</a> describes two minor differences between
              Luminary 96 and 97.&nbsp; Meanwhile, <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n70/mode/1up">engineering



















                drawing 2021152</a> lists all of the memory-bank
              checksums for Luminary 96 and 97; since they match the
              reconstructed Luminary 96 and 97 code exactly, we can be
              confident that Luminary 96 and 97 are <i>very</i> likely
              to be correct.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately, Luminary 98 was merely an engineering
              revision of the software for which no core-rope modules
              were manufactured, so drawing 2021152 does not record its
              memory-bank checksums.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, since
              the correctness of our Luminary 98 reconstruction is a
              prerequisite for the correctness of our Luminary 97
              reconstruction, which we are confident in, we can have a
              pretty fair degree of confidence that Luminary 98 is
              correct as well.<br>
              <br>
              <a name="Kernan" id="Kernan"></a>Luminary 96 and 97 are
              connected by a very interesting story. I'll let James
              Kernan, one of the original AGC developers and the Apollo
              11 Luminary "rope mother", tell it in his own words:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <small>I was an employee
                  at Draper Lab, and was in charge of the Lunar Module
                  LGC computer programming group and also in charge of
                  Assembly Control for the flight software during the
                  Apollo 9-12 software development period.&nbsp; The
                  latter responsibility included reviewing all proposed
                  alterations to the flight software and the YUL
                  assembler inputs.<br>
                  <br>
                  I can explain the confusion over the Luminary version
                  that flew on Apollo 11.&nbsp; We were aiming for
                  Luminary Revision 99 as the Apollo 11 Lunar Module
                  flight software.&nbsp; There was a tradition (or rule)
                  that the flight software version should have no
                  revision, so we renamed Luminary Revision 099 as Lum99
                  Revision 0.&nbsp; At the last minute, Dan Lickly, our
                  chief engineer, appeared with ephemerides updates and
                  it took two tries to get it right.&nbsp; The result
                  was that we created Lum99 Revision 1 and Lum99
                  Revision 2.&nbsp; We made a no-change version of the
                  latter and named it Lum99R2 Revision 0.<br>
                  <br>
                  The tapes and ropes were made from that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  That is my recollection.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did
                  not have the foresight to keep a printout of the
                  flight version.</small><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Some years later, he retells the story as follows:<br>
              <blockquote><small>The evening of the release for Apollo
                  11, John Sutherland and I were in the assembly control
                  room about to make the final assembly of
                  Luminary.&nbsp; For reasons unsupportable by reason, I
                  had decided that the Luminary revision for Apollo 11
                  would be less than 100 and lo and behold we were about
                  to make revision 99.&nbsp; The procedure for releasing
                  a program for manufacture entailed assigning a
                  &lt;unique name&gt; Revision 0 by NASA &lt;part
                  number&gt;.&nbsp; The Revision Number had to be 0 and
                  the author had to be NASA with the manufacture part
                  number included.&nbsp; So we chose Lum99 Revision 0 by
                  NASA &lt;part number&gt;.&nbsp; We had previously got
                  the part number from Bob Millard in the Program
                  Office.&nbsp; The LM part numbers were in the 2
                  million series (if I remember correctly) and CM
                  numbers were one million.&nbsp; We had just made
                  LUMINARY Revision 99 when Dan Lickly, our chief
                  engineer, came into the room with the news that the
                  ephemeris numbers had to be updated.&nbsp; This seemly
                  upset my desire to keep the revision number under 100.
                  But the Yul system was flexible.&nbsp; We changed the
                  name to LUM99R1, and since it took 2 to get the
                  ephemeris numbers right, the final listing is named
                  LUM99R2 Revision 0 by NASA &lt;part number&gt;.&nbsp;
                  So if you have a listing of what you think is the
                  landing program for Apollo 11, look at the name,
                  revision, and author to make sure.&nbsp; I did not
                  keep a copy ( I wish I had).&nbsp; The mainline
                  development of Luminary for subsequent missions
                  continued with revision 100.</small><br>
              </blockquote>
              But wait, you say: These stories relate to Luminary 99,
              not to 96!&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Yes, that's true.&nbsp; But Jim's stories have a problem,
              in that there's no documentary evidence whatever to
              support them if taken at face value.&nbsp; Every other
              scrap of evidence we have, some of it quite compelling,
              tells us that Luminary 99 rev 1 was flown in Apollo 11,
              and there is no mention at all, anywhere, of a Luminary 99
              rev 2.<br>
              <br>
              So how are we to reconcile Jim's very-detailed
              recollections with the documented facts?&nbsp; As
              mentioned above, <a href="Documents/LNY-59.jpg">software
                anomaly report LNY-59</a> tells us that there's a
              problem in Luminary 96, and that the problem is two
              incorrect ephemeris constants ... which could easily be
              exactly what Jim remembers being wrong about Luminary 99
              rev 1.&nbsp; Moreover, LNY-59 was filed by Jim
              himself!&nbsp; So insofar as the specific software
              problems are concerned, it's easy to see that Jim's
              stories are more likely to be about Luminary 96/97 than
              about Luminary 99 rev 1/2.<br>
              <br>
              And yet ... Jim's stories are so <i>detailed</i>. He's so
              <i>certain</i> about them. And they persist over
              time.&nbsp; How could they possibly be wrong in the way
              I'm suggesting?<br>
              <br>
              As it happens, I've just finished reading a book about how
              human memory works — if you're interested, it's <i>Remember:



















                The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting</i>, by
              Lisa Genova — and from it, this kind of memory error seems
              extremely plausible.&nbsp; The book says that in some
              sense, human memory is a kind of read-writeback system; in
              other words, every time you recall a memory, it is then
              subsequently written back to refresh it.&nbsp; So what you
              recall the next time isn't the original memory, but
              instead whatever was written back the previous time you
              recalled it.&nbsp; Moreover, the memory may have been
              subtly, unintentionally edited in the brief interval
              between recall and writeback.&nbsp; The whole thing is
              like <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">a
                game of Telephone</a>, in which a repeatedly-retold
              story inevitably become mutated while being retold, until
              it is unrecognizable when it eventually returns to its
              originator.&nbsp; Ironically, the bigger the impression
              the event originally made upon you — as is the case in
              this story of Jim's — the more <i>certain</i> you are of
              your memory of it, but also you retell it more often, and
              hence your recollection of the event mutates <i>more</i>
              over time.&nbsp;&nbsp; And why would it mutate in just
              this way?&nbsp; Well, it makes a lot better story if it
              occurs at the last minute in the final release of Apollo
              11, rather than in an earlier version that ended up not
              being flown.&nbsp; Every time the story is repeated, it's
              under pressure to mutate in a way that make it more
              interesting or significant.&nbsp; Keep that in mind the
              next time you embellish one of your memories when you
              recount it as a story to impress someone; you're fooling
              not just your listener, but maybe your future self as
              well!<br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, I'm no memory expert myself, so you can
              accept or reject my rationale about Jim's story however
              you like.<br>
              <br>
              Actually, Jim's story <i>is</i> correct in one
              interesting regard, namely that the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris">ephemeris</a>
              data in Luminary 99 Rev 1 still ended up being
              out-of-date, but just not out-of-date enough to be of
              concern.&nbsp; I'm sure Jim knew this, and that it
              probably had some role in mutating his recollection.&nbsp;
              How do we know the ephemeris was outdated?&nbsp; Well,
              ephemeris data in an AGC program covers the timespan of a
              year, <a href="Documents/SGA_Memo20_650929.pdf">beginning
                on July 1 of one year and continuing through June 30 of
                the following year</a>, and so the missions in the time
              range July 1, 1969, through June 30, 1970, should all have
              the same ephemeris data.&nbsp; Those missions happen to be
              Apollo 11, Apollo 12 , and Apollo 13.&nbsp; The ephemeris
              data is roughly the last 50 lines of the CONTROLLED
              CONSTANTS in the Luminary source code, or in this case<br>
              <ul>
                <li><a
                    href="listings/Luminary099/CONTROLLED_CONSTANTS.agc.html">Apollo

                    Luminary 99 Rev 1 CONTROLLED CONSTANTS</a></li>
                <li><a
                    href="listings/Luminary116/CONTROLLED_CONSTANTS.agc.html">Apollo

                    href="listings/Luminary131/CONTROLLED_CONSTANTS.agc.html">Apollo

              </ul>
              <p>and it's pretty easy to see that there's a mismatch
                between Luminary 99 Rev 1 and the other two.&nbsp; Nor,
                as Jim's story would suggest, does it match <a
                  href="listings/Luminary069/CONTROLLED_CONSTANTS.agc.html">Apollo
10



















                  (Luminary 69)</a>, from the preceding 12-month
                interval.&nbsp; But not to worry!&nbsp; Apollo 11
                ephemeris, as flown, was slightly out of date, but it
                was plenty fine for a lunar landing.&nbsp; I presume is
                why they didn't bother to correct it until Apollo 12.<br>
              </p>
              <p>(As it happens, I created the source code for a
                hypothetical Luminary 99 rev 2, with the correct
                ephemeris, before LNY-59 was discovered, back when we
                still believed that Jim's story really related to
                Luminary 99 rev 1.&nbsp; You can still find the <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/LUM99R2">source



















                  code</a> for that in our software repository.&nbsp;
                But it's of no historical value or validity, though it
                does work fine for a lunar landing, so I no longer
                include it in this table.)<br>

          <td valign="middle">One of the original AGC programmers, Allan
            Klumpp, kept a copy of Luminary 99 Rev 0 (or 99/0 for
            short), since donated to <a href="http://www.klabs.org">klabs.org</a>,
            having been told that it was the version that flew on Apollo
            11.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that turns out not to have been the
            case, but it was indeed the first revision of Luminary
            released for manufacture for Apollo 11 ... by which I mean
            that its core-rope memory modules were actually
            manufactured, though not flown.<br>
            <span id="moreLUMINARY99" style="display:none"> <br>
              We know that the program identifies itself as "REVISION
              099 OF AGC PROGRAM LUMINARY BY NASA 2021112-051" in the
              page headings of the printouts, so from <a
                href="R700-3-Table4-11.jpg">the chart at the top of this
                page</a> we know that it's the revision immediately <i>preceding</i>
              the flown version.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we at the Virtual
              AGC Project have never actually had access to the Luminary
              99/0 hardcopy itself, or to any scans of it.&nbsp; I hope
              some day to have it scanned, though with each passing year
              that seems an increasingly distant dream.&nbsp;
              Apparently, Luminary 97 was actually the first AGC
              software version actually targeted for Apollo 11, and thus
              had already been modified by the time of Luminary 99/0.<br>
              <br>
              As it turns out, our Mike Stewart (thanks Mike, and Nik
              Beug who also helped out) has noticed that we have just
              enough info at our disposal to <i>reconstruct</i> the
              source code for Luminary 99/0 even in the absence of the
              program listing itself.&nbsp; And having reconstructed the
              source code, we thus get the executable octal rope for
              free, and can run it in the AGC simulator.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              The source code reconstructed by Mike is what you see
              linked at the left.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              A few things worked in Mike's favor in performing the
              reconstruction.&nbsp; For one thing, at the time the
              reconstruction was done, we already had the program
              version immediately following it (namely Luminary 99/1,
              see the very next row in this table), and a version not
              much earlier (namely Luminary 69/2, see the preceding row
              in this table).&nbsp; For another, in hardcopies of
              program listings like those for Luminary 99/1, the
              relatively few lines which have <i>changed</i> from prior
              versions are marked with a *, making them relatively easy
              to find.&nbsp; Finally, while Allan did not give us his
              hardcopy of Luminary 99/0 to scan, he <i>did</i> agree to
              look at the memory-bank checksums for us, and was kind
              enough to give us the checksum of the single memory bank
              that differed from 99/1 ... so we could easily verify that
              the reconstruction was very <i>likely</i> to be
              correct.&nbsp; Of course, one can never be 100% sure, in
              the continued absence of the hardcopy.&nbsp; But we're
              pretty confident that the reconstruction is accurate;
              admittedly, it's possible we may not have found all of the
              program-comment changes.<br>
              <br>
              In case you're wondering, the only change between this
              version and the flown version (099/1) is the correction of
              a long-standing bug, in which a reset of the computer
              incorrectly reset (cleared) certain of the hardware
              timers, thus resulting in events that were triggered by
              the next expiration of those timers occurring at the wrong
              time.<br>

            version that was flown in the Apollo 11 Lunar Module.&nbsp;
            By the way, strictly speaking I don't think this program is
            LUMINARY, but instead had been branched off from the main
            branch of LUMINARY source code (..., LUMINARY 97, LUMINARY
            98, LUMINARY 99, LUMINARY 100, ....) at LUMINARY 99.&nbsp;
            This new branch of code was called "LMY99" rather than
            "LUMINARY", so that's why at the tops of the pages of the
            assembly listing you see that it's listed as "PROGRAM LMY99"
            rather than "PROGRAM LUMINARY", and that's why the revision
            level is listed as 001 rather than 099.&nbsp; This kind of
            trick allowed development for Apollo 12 to continue with
            LUMINARY 100, LUMINARY 101, and so on, while development for
            Apollo 11 continued with LMY99.<br>

              The MIT Museum copy is dated 14 July, 1969, which seems
              odd at first glance, since it would be far too late to
              actually have been included in the Apollo 11
              mission.&nbsp; AGC developer Hugh Blair-Smith speculates
              that this is the date of the printing rather than of the
              program build, and that seems plausible ... it seems as
              though you'd want to have it, for historical purposes!
              &nbsp; At any rate, the printout identifies itself as
              "REVISION 001 OF AGC PROGRAM LMY99 BY NASA 2021112-061",
              which according to <a href="R700-3-Table4-11.jpg">the
                chart at the very top of this web-page</a> tells you
              that it is indeed the version that was flown in the
              mission ... but keep reading, because there are curious
              postscripts!<br>
              <br>
              AGC developer Don Eyles also has a copy of Luminary 99,
              though oddly named AP11ROPE BY EYLES rather than LMY99 BY
              NASA, and it was printed in 1970 for some reason.&nbsp;
              Our scan was financed by Vipin Rathor (thanks,
              Vipin!)&nbsp; After a full analysis of AP11ROPE yet, I can
              tell you the following:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>The octal rope for AP11ROPE — i.e., the executable
                  form into which the source code compiles — is <i>identical</i>
                  to that of Luminary 99/1.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp;
                  differences in the source code are confined to things
                  like program comments which don't affect the
                  executable code.</li>
                <li>There is precisely one difference between the
                  program comments in AP11ROPE and our earlier scan from
                  the MIT library, and that is on page 2 of the listing,
                  in which a group of software modules is mentioned as
                  "LEMONAID" in the one case, and "LNYAIDE" in the
                  other.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Regarding the software modules just mentioned, even
                  though Don hadn't changed the program comment naming
                  them, he actually referred to this section (pp.
                  153-489) as "AP11AID", indicating that he presumably
                  intended to make changes in this area to further his
                  purpose in branching AP11ROPE from LUMINARY, but just
                  hadn't done so yet.&nbsp; We know this because of the
                  fact that assembler-generated lines in the printout
                  refer to this section not as LEMONAID but as AP11AID.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Finally, "LEMONAID" was the name for this section in
                  LUMINARY 69, so that fact that the program comments in
                  AP11ROPE continue to refer to it as LEMONAID rather
                  than as LNYAIDE implies that AP11ROPE was not branched
                  directly from LUMINARY 099/1, in spite of being
                  essentially identical to it.&nbsp; <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              It's worth mentioning that we have a pair of "digital
              simulations" of the landing.&nbsp; These were simulations
              performed during the Apollo era, and <i>not</i>
              simulations we have performed as part of the Virtual AGC
              project.&nbsp; They are very complete, containing not only
              pad loads, but also position/velocity data, notations of
              what the astronaut is supposed to input on the DSKY, what
              the DSKY is displaying on a moment-to-moment basis,
              occasional memory dumps, and so on. &nbsp; There are two
              such surviving simulations for Apollo 11, both from Don
              Eyles's personal collection.&nbsp; We have had them
              scanned, with Matthew Fite financially sponsoring <a
href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo//Documents/apollo11landingd00miti_0.pdf">the
















                1969 version</a> and Fabrizio Bernardini financially
              sponsoring <a
                href="https://archive.org/details/dianarev12level302eyle/mode/1up">the
















                1971 version</a>.&nbsp; (Thanks Matthew and
              Fabrizio!)&nbsp; The two simulations are somewhat
              different; i.e., these are <i>not</i> merely two
              different scans of the same thing.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
              the printout for the 1971 simulation is quite
              low-contrast, and its full-color scans quite hard to read.<br>
              <br>
              The 1969 digital simulation was done a few days <i>after</i>
              the actual landing.&nbsp; While we're not 100% sure why it
              was made, one speculation is that it was done in order to
              investigate the causes of the 1201 and 1202 program alarms
              that had been experienced during the landing itself.&nbsp;
              Don Eyles agrees that this must have been what he
              intended, and points out that his notes indicate that
              TLOSS (the maximum amount of CPU time that it was
              permissible to "lose") was set to 10% in that run. (It was
              the fact that the CPU time lost in interacting with the
              rendezvous radar was excessive that caused the Apollo 11
              1201/1202 alarms. See <a href="Documents/LUM140_text.pdf">LUMINARY


















                Memo #140</a>, for example, for some background
              information about TLOSS.)<br>
              <br>
              Also, you may wonder, why was there a digital simulation
              of Apollo 11 in 1971, a couple of years <i>after</i>
              Apollo 11 landed on the moon?&nbsp; Shouldn't the
              simulations only have been useful <i>before</i> the
              landing?&nbsp; Well, Don Eyles had this simulation
              performed for his own purposes and (after nearly 50
              years!) is no longer sure quite what that purpose
              was.&nbsp; He worked on several off-the-main branch AGC
              programs, such as ZERLINA (see below), intended to explore
              improved methods for performing the landing; my theory is
              that this simulation provided baseline data against which
              to measure such improvements, and Don admits that this is
              a plausible theory.<br>
              <br>
              Speaking of ZERLINA, if you examine the scans, you may
              notice that the label on the binder identifies the 1971
              simulation as "DIANA Rev. 12".&nbsp; It is <i>not</i>
              DIANA, however: the binder containing the simulation's
              printout had <i>formerly</i> contained a copy of DIANA,
              we believe, and Don simply reused it for this printout
              without relabeling it.&nbsp; DIANA was another
              off-the-main-branch program, like ZERLINA, which was
              developed by Peter Adler and Don Eyles in order to explore
              an improved time-sharing technique that would avoid the
              1201 and 1202 program alarms experienced in the Apollo 11
              landing.&nbsp; The approach wasn't adopted, though, and
              copies of DIANA no longer exist as far as we know.&nbsp;
              (At any rate, neither Don nor Peter has a copy.)<br>

              Let me point out a few other documents that help to
              provide insight into Luminary 116' innards.<br>
              <br>
              The <a href="Documents/j2-80-MSC-69-FS-4_text.pdf">Programmed
















                Guidance Equations</a> is an MSC document whose purpose

              of various program performance features and to permit more
              effective review of published computer program
              documentation".&nbsp; In other words, while it does
              contain material related to guidance equations, it is
              perhaps better to think of this as being a pseudo-code
              description of the Luminary 116 program.<br>
              <br>
              The <a href="Documents/apollo12landingd00miti.pdf">digital
















                simulation of the landing</a>, from Don Eyles's personal
              collection (with scanning financially sponsored by Matthew
              Fite), had been made a few months <i>after</i> the Apollo
              12 landing itself.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; Surely, the
              simulation is useful only <i>before</i> the landing?
              Niklas Beug has researched the matter, and has noticed
              that a couple of the pad-load settings (namely TCGIBRAK
              and TCGFBRAK) in the digital simulation are a bit
              puzzling.&nbsp; What these tricky pad-load values do is to
              prevent the time-consuming computation of the matrix for
              converting between the coordinate system of the Inertial
              Measurement Unit's stable platform and the coordinate
              system of the landing site from occurring within
              P63.&nbsp; This is fine because the stable platform is
              aligned (by the astronauts) with the landing site
              reference frame before the approach occurs, so the two
              coordinate systems are one and the same.&nbsp; The Apollo
              12 software, then, was used for testing that this would
              work simply because it was coincidentally the most-current
              software revision at the time, and not because the digital
              simulation had anything to do with Apollo 12 as
              such.&nbsp; And Niklas has actually performed a simulated
              landing with these pad-loads to insure that it can be
              done.&nbsp; Admittedly, Don Eyles isn't particularly
              receptive of this explanation, so the conclusion remains
              in doubt.<br>

            the revision eventually flown in the mission. Unfortunately,
            for over a decade, I said here that it was the revision
            actually flown.&nbsp; Niklas Beug was sharp enough to notice
            what I was not, namely in the table from <a
              href="R700-3-Table4-11.jpg">document R-700 shown at the
              top of this very web-page</a> that what <i>we</i> have is
            the first version (December 1969) of Luminary 131, but that
            subsequent versions were released in January and February
            1970, and it was the latter of which that was flown. <br>
            <span id="moreLUMINARY131" style="display:none"> <br>
              In the early years of this project (2003-2016), we relied
              on a scanned PDF of Luminary 131 that had appeared on the
              now-defunct History of Recent Technology (HRST)
              website.&nbsp; We're not entirely sure of the history of
              that scan, though there is <a
                href="ScansForConversion/Luminary131/coverLetter.png">a
                great cover letter</a> from original AGC developer Jim
              Kernan that goes with it. What we are pretty sure of is
              that David Craig, apparently a great collector of AGC
              artifacts, asked for an AGC program listing, got this one
              (possibly xeroxed by Hugh Blair-Smith according to one
              theory), and that Gary Neff scanned it, passing the scans
              along to the HRST website administrators.&nbsp;
              Unfortunately, the image quality became severely
              compromised after that point ... but whatever the image
              quality, we have to be grateful to all of these folks,
              because it was really the existence of this scan that made
              our entire Virtual AGC project possible.&nbsp; Thanks,
              guys!&nbsp; Indeed, Gary Neff also later kindly provided
              me with a replacement for a page which is garbled in the
              HRST version. <br>
              <br>
              Nevertheless, however grateful we may feel for the HRST
              version, we're luckier today to have an infinitely
              superior scan, made for us from the personal collection of
              AGC developer Don Eyles, and scanned for us by
              archive.org.&nbsp; A few pages (1728-1734) happen to be
              missing from Don's copy, and I've simply inserted them
              from the HRST copy.&nbsp; You can still find the original
              scan in our Document Library, but I'm providing only the
              link to the better version here.<br>
              <br>
              Finally ... we can tell that these two different scans
              actually came from the same <i>physical</i> copy.&nbsp;
              This makes sense from Jim Kernan's cover letter to David
              Craig, which says that Don Eyles supplied it.&nbsp;
              However, if you try to check the scans for the
              hand-written notes that appear on many of the AGC
              listings, you soon realize that the HRST version doesn't
              have the notations that the Eyles version has, which is at
              first blush is impossible from the same printout!&nbsp;
              Well, if you're persistent enough, you do eventually find
              notations that appear on both of them.&nbsp; (Look on page
              750.)&nbsp; So the conclusion must be that Don (or
              somebody) wrote in most of these notes <i>after</i> the
              HRST version was copied in 1991, rather than during the
              actual Apollo project.&nbsp; Isn't that nice to think that
              the program was actually being read and deeply examined,
              instead of simply being forgotten on a shelf?<br>
              <br>
              If you're interested in insights into the internal
              structure of Luminary 1C, you might also want to look at <a
                href="Documents/19740073277.pdf">the Programmed Guidance
                Equations document</a>.&nbsp; It is an MSC document
              whose purpose is "to provide more effective identification
              and analysis of various program performance features and
              to permit more effective review of published computer

            whose ropes were manufactured for Apollo 13, and it was the
            revision eventually flown in the mission.&nbsp; By referring
            to it as LUMINARY 131/1, I'm playing loose with the
            facts.&nbsp; In reality, it was "LM131 rev 1" and strictly
            speaking isn't even a revision of LUMINARY at all.<br>
            <span id="moreLM131rev1" style="display:none"> <br>
              The thousand words of explanation that follow are
              concisely summarized in the figure to the left, which
              depicts the evolution of the LM software in the time-frame
              of development for Apollo 13.&nbsp; The left-hand column
              in the figure is the main line of LUMINARY development, in
              which there is a program called "LUMINARY" that progresses
              through a sequence of revisions such as 129, 130, 131,
              132, and so on.<br>
              <br>
              What you <i>don't</i> see in that clean, concise
              depiction of revisions is the machinery for deciding what
              gets changed in one revision of the software to the
              next.&nbsp; It's not just the whims of the development
              teams.&nbsp; Rather, the software is strictly controlled,
              and there is an official process which must be followed to
              authorize (and test) which changes are incorporated in
              which missions.&nbsp; One part of the process is that each
              potential change is described by a form specifying not
              only the problem which the change is intended to fix, but
              often outlining the potential solution as well.&nbsp;
              These forms have names like Problem Change Requests and
              Notices (PCRs and PCNs) or Software Anomaly Reports.&nbsp;
              The former are either approved or rejected by NASA's
              Software Control Board (SCB) while the latter are either
              approved or rejected by MIT/IL's Assembly Control Board
              (ACB).&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Thus for each mission, there's a list of
              officially-approved PCRs/PCNs/Software Anomaly Reports by
              which it differs from the preceding revision.&nbsp; From
              the figure, you can see that the first software released
              for Apollo 13, LUMINARY 130, needed to be corrected by a
              single PCR (PCR 893), at which point LUMINARY 131 was
              released. Everybody thought that things were swell as far
              as Apollo 13 was concerned, and moved on to developing
              LUMINARY 132, LUMINARY 133, and so on, for Apollo 14.<br>
              <br>
              Well, when I say <i>everybody</i> thought things were
              swell, I'm glossing over the fact that brains at NASA were
              still percolating even after the software had been
              released.&nbsp; What NASA wondered was whether a feature
              referred to as "Auto P66" could possibly still be added in
              time for Apollo 13.&nbsp; Ironically, of course, Auto P66
              would never be used on Apollo 13, regardless of whether or
              not the software supported it.&nbsp; But nobody knew that,
              so MIT/IL agreed, and PCR 988 was born!<br>
              <br>
              However ... by that time, LUMINARY 132 was long gone, and
              it and its children were now loaded with changes
              authorized only for Apollo 14.&nbsp; What you do in these
              situations is to "branch" the development.&nbsp; In other
              words, a new program — in this case called "LUM131" — was
              created by cloning LUMINARY 131.&nbsp; All changes for
              Apollo 14 would continue to be added <i>only</i> to
              LUMINARY, while all changes for Apollo 13 would
              independently be added only to LUM131.&nbsp; (PCR 988
              would have to be added to <i>both</i> programs, and would
              eventually separately be added for Apollo 14 somewhere
              around LUMINARY 147.)<br>
              <br>
              Thus work proceeded normally on incorporating PCR 988 into
              LUM131, which eventually went through 8 revisions,
              reaching a release of LUM131 rev 9.&nbsp; Everything was
              once more swell with Apollo 13, and everybody moved on to
              other things.<br>
              <br>
              But wait!&nbsp; When I say <i>everybody</i> moved on, I'm
              glossing over the fact that even after software is
              released for the manufacturing of the core-rope memory
              modules, post-release testing ("Level 6 Testing") still
              proceeds using physical AGCs and memory modules.&nbsp;
              Usually that testing works out well, but in <i>this</i>
              instance they discovered that TLOSS was too big: i.e.,
              that the too many CPU cycles were being used by the
              combined hardware and software!&nbsp; This was a critical
              problem that needed to be fixed in Apollo 13, and couldn't
              wait until Apollo 14.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Hence, PCR 1013 was born.&nbsp; The software was once
              again branched, and a new program, "LUM131A", was created
              from LUM131 rev 9 for the purpose of incorporating PCR
              1013.&nbsp; Now, that's a bit of a mystery.&nbsp; Why
              branch again, when you could just continue development
              with LUM131 rev 10, 11, 12, etc.?&nbsp; I don't know the
              answer; perhaps additional changes not authorized for
              Apollo 13 had already been incorporated into LUM131 rev
              10.&nbsp; Well as I say, it's a mystery.<br>
              <br>
              At any rate, incorporation of PCR 1013 proceeded as
              LUM131A passed through revisions 1, 2, and 3, at which
              point it was finally ready!<br>
              <br>
              But now here's an additional mystery, since what was
              actually released for the mission was called program
              "LM131 rev 1" rather than "LUM131A rev 3".&nbsp; By most
              indications, these seem to have been the identical thing,
              with no differences between them.&nbsp; So why branch the
              software again?&nbsp; Was LUM131A continuing to undergo
              changes not authorized for Apollo 13, and thus there were
              LUM131A rev 4, 5, etc., that we don't know about?&nbsp; Or
              some conflict with their naming conventions, and they
              didn't like the "A" at the end of "LUM131A"?&nbsp; But
              again, we don't know.<br>
              <br>
              So if you'll forgive a few question marks we haven't been
              able to fill in, that's the whole long, strange journey of
              Apollo 13's LM software, from LUMINARY 130 to LUMINARY 131
              to LUM131 rev 9 to LUM131A rev 3 to LM131 rev 1.<br>

          <td valign="top"><a name="Zerlina"></a>ZERLINA was an
            off-the-main branch AGC program, by Don Eyles, which
            experimentally developed a number of proposed improvements
            to Luminary.&nbsp; Some of these improvements were actually
            incorporated in later versions of Luminary ... but also,
            many were never used, even where they were demonstrably
            better, due to the need to avoid unnecessary risks —
            changing software is always a risk! — as the Apollo program
            approached its end. For example, I believe that improved
            methods for increasing the positional accuracy of the
            landing were explored in it, partially due to some ideas of
            astronaut John Young, who flew Zerlina in the LM simulator.<br>
            <span id="moreZERLINA56" style="display:none"> <br>
              Our scan of ZERLINA, by the way, was financially sponsored
              by Linden Sims.&nbsp; Thanks, Linden!<br>
              <br>
              Zerlina itself was apparently branched from Luminary 145,
              and was developed independently for a period of 6-7
              months.&nbsp; Quite a few <a
                href="links.html#LUMINARY_Memos">LUMINARY Memos</a>
              describe the evolution of Zerlina, such as memos #138,
              #149, #161, #171, and #177. Memo #177 covers Zerlina 56
              specifically, so as far as we know, 56 was probably the
              last version of Zerlina.<br>
              <br>
              Zerlina was not the <i>only</i> such experimental branch
              of the AGC code, but it is the only one (that we know of)
              to have survived, and it is the one about which we have
              the most information.<br>
              <br>
              Regarding the digital landing simulation linked at the
              left, it is an Apollo-era simulation run by Don Eyles,
              rather than a "modern" simulation done by the Virtual AGC
              project.&nbsp; The printout came from Don's own private
              hoard, and the scanning for our Internet Archive
              collection was financed by Niklas Beug and Alex Bart
              (thanks, guys!).<br>
              <br>
              In fact, Nik has actually flown a lunar landing using
              Zerlina in the NASSP/Orbiter spacecraft simulator, and has
              shared a video of it:<br>

            163 and Luminary 173 were the first and second revisions of
            Luminary targeted for the Apollo 14 Lunar Module.&nbsp;
            Their core-rope modules were manufactured, but they were not
            actually flown in the mission.&nbsp; (See Luminary 178
            below.)<br>
            <br>
            No contemporary program listings for Luminary 163 and 173
            are known to us, but the programs have been reconstructed
            with a high degree of confidence.&nbsp; You should consult
            Mike Stewart's notes on the reconstruction (see issues <a
              href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/pull/1098">#1098</a>
            and <a
              href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/pull/1099">#1099</a>
            in our software repository) to understand the reconstruction
            process and the differences from software version to
            software version.&nbsp; Regarding confidence, however, the
            important point to note in these (and in all such)
            reconstructions is that in addition to matching the
            documented version-to-version changes, the memory-bank
            checksums of the reconstructed software match those of the
            manufactured core-rope modules as listed in MIT/IL
            engineering drawing <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n80/mode/1up">2021152N</a>.&nbsp;



















            However, things like program comments and page numbering,
            which do not affect the contents of the rope memory, may
            differ from those of the true program listings.<br>

              We've never found any original printout of the Luminary
              178 program, but Mike Stewart has managed to reconstruct
              the program, and we have a very high degree of confidence
              that the reconstruction is correct.&nbsp; By that, I mean
              that the source code which has been reconstructed
              assembles to a core-rope image in 100% byte-for-byte (or
              word-for-word, to be picky) agreement with what was flown
              in Apollo 14 — i.e., a 100% correct executable
              program.&nbsp; However, because of the nature of the
              reconstruction process, it's extremely likely that some
              program comments or other superficial features that don't
              affect the final core-rope image won't agree perfectly
              with the original code, if/when we ever find a copy of it.<br>

              want to be awed.&nbsp; I'm willing to summarize it for you
              in a <i>slightly</i> less mind-boggling way.<br>
              <br>
              At the time the reconstruction was done (Summer 2019), the
              closest revisions to Luminary 178 that were available to
              us were those of <a href="#Luminary131">Luminary 131</a>
              (Apollo 13) and <a href="#Luminary210">Luminary 210</a>
              (Apollo 15).&nbsp; Note the huge gaps:&nbsp; There were 47
              revisions of Luminary between Apollo 13 and 14, and 32
              revisions of Luminary between Apollo 14 and 15 ... and the
              reconstruction requires you to either add in or subtract
              out most of those changes!&nbsp; So how does one fill in
              such huge gaps?<br>
              <br>
              Fortunately, Mike noticed additionally that we had a copy
              of <a href="#Zerlina">Zerlina 56</a>, which is not
              technically Luminary, but which was branched from Luminary
              145, and had had <i>most</i> of the changes up through
              Luminary 183 added to it afterward.&nbsp; So Zerlina 56 <i>ought</i>
              to be much closer to Luminary 178 than either Luminary 131
              or 210 is.&nbsp; Additionally, our document library has a
              vast store of "<a href="links.html#LUMINARY_Memos">Luminary


















                Memos</a>", many of which are devoted to describing
              (albeit only textually) the differences from one Luminary
              (and Zerlina) revision to the next.&nbsp; Simply slogging
              through all of the differences between Luminary 131,
              Luminary 210, and Zerlina 56, and cross-referencing those
              differences to the Luminary Memos (and other supporting
              documentation), was all it took to reconstruct Luminary
              178.&nbsp; Well, that and a lot of cleverness, and several
              months of effort!&nbsp; In the end, Mike says that only 6
              lines of code needed to be written from scratch, as
              opposed to being taken as-is from one of those other
              sources.<br>
              <br>
              And perhaps most-importantly, since nobody (even Mike!)
              would have been likely to attempt a reconstruction without
              it, we have MIT/IL engineering drawing <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n80/mode/1up">2021152N</a>.&nbsp;



















              This drawing is a list of the memory-bank checksums of all
              manufactured Luminary rope-memory modules.&nbsp; Since the
              memory-bank checksums for Luminary 178 listed in drawing
              2021152N <i>agree</i> with the memory-bank checksums you
              get when you assemble the reconstructed Luminary 178
              source code, we are confident the reconstruction is
              correct!<br>
              <br>
              As the final icing on the cake, Niklas Beug, a developer
              and user of <a href="https://github.com/dseagrav/NASSP">NASSP,



















                the Apollo-mission add-on for the Orbiter spaceflight
                simulator</a>, has flown the reconstructed Luminary 178
              code in the simulator, and performed a landing with it,
              apparently without problems of any kind ... I guess that
              means that the simulator <i>didn't</i> have a ball of
              solder rolling around inside the control panel and
              threatening to short out the ABORT button.&nbsp;
              (Ha!)&nbsp; I have no video of the simulated landing to
              show you, but at least you can see the lander resting at

      In other words, to create a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
      binary executable rather than using the one provided with yaAGC
      (such as Luminary131.bin), one simply needs to assemble the file
      MAIN.agc.&nbsp; Typically, if all files remain organized the way
      they are in the yaAGC distribution tarball, the sequence of steps
      for doing so (from a command-line prompt) would be something like
      this:<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <br>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Luminary131</span><br
          style="font-family: monospace;">
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">../yaYUL/yaYUL --force
          MAIN.agc &gt;Luminary131.lst</span><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The listfile (Luminary131.lst) so produced is a bit more
      manageable than scans of the original printouts, in that it is a
      hundredth the size and you can perform text-searches on it.&nbsp;
      The binary so produced, MAIN.agc.bin, should be byte-for-byte
      identical to the binary (Luminary131.bin) provided with the yaAGC
      distribution.&nbsp; Therefore, the following Linux command should
      reveal no differences between the two:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
          monospace;">diff -s MAIN.agc.bin Luminary131.bin</span><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      (Replace "diff -s" with "fc /b" in Windows.)&nbsp;<br>

              A point which may not be completely appreciated is that
              Luminary131.bin was <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
              created from the assembly-language source files.&nbsp;
              Therefore, the byte-for-byte equivalence mentioned above
              actually has some significance.&nbsp; In fact, both the
              assembly-language source code and Luminary131.bin (or
              Luminary131.binsource) come from separate readings of the
              original <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
              assembly listing scan, so their equivalence provides an
              important check on validity.&nbsp; (See below.)&nbsp; The
              file Luminary131.bin was created from the
              human-readable/editable ASCII file Luminary131.binsource
              by means of the program <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oct2Bin</span>,
              with the following steps:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace;">
                cd Luminary131<br>

              Admittedly, few people are likely to perform any

      100% accurate.&nbsp; If you're not willing to take my word for
      that, and if the discussion in the preceding section doesn't

      The Luminary 099 page images became available after the Colossus
      249 and Luminary 131page images had already been converted to
      source-code files, and prior to any other missions becoming
      available.&nbsp; The conversion technique was very abbreviated
      compared to that of Luminary 131, as follows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A small corps of volunteers—thanks (in alphabetical order)
          Fabrizio Bernardini, Hartmuth Gutsche, Onno Hommes, Jim
          Lawton, and Sergio Navarro!—took the existing Luminary 131
          source-code files and laboriously compared them line-by-line
          to the Luminary 099 assembly-listing page images, porting the
          differences they found.</li>
        <li>The resulting Luminary 099 source code was assembled using <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> to produce a binary
          executable, which was horribly wrong at this point, but was
          used to create a "binsource" file (which is an octal listing
          of the entire program).</li>
        <li>The binsource file was laboriously proofed against the octal
          listing in the page images (this time by me), and
          corrected.&nbsp; As a double-check, the bank checksums are all
          correct.</li>
        <li>Finally, at every point where the binary created from the
          source code by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
          differed from the binsource file, the source code was compared
          to the page images and corrected.&nbsp; After all corrections
          were made, the binary created by <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">yaYUL</span> was identical to the binary created from
          the binsource file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The binary thus produced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
        is supplied in the source tree and used for regression testing.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Validity of the Other Versions</h3>
      Well, it's much the same as what's above, so I'm not going to keep
      describing the same steps over and over again.&nbsp; Suffice it to
      say that we verified them all using the same standards.<br>
