LM-Simulator Help
=================

The program "LM_Simulator" simulates the Lunar Module of the NASA Apollo Moon landing project.
It is an add-on to Ron Burkey's "yaAGC" which is a complete emulation of the original Apollo Guidance Computer
running the real AGC Software developed by the MIT.
In simple words, you have the computing capacity of the Apollo Program at your fingertips which enables you to
simulate real world Lunar Module flight states by typing in the same AGC commands as the Apollo Astronauts did.

Please refer to Ron Burkey's web page (http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/) to get an extensive description of the
Apollo Guidance Computer itself as well as to download the whole source code package ready for Linux, MS Windows
and MAC or just the Windows binaries for the stand-alone version of the LM-Simulator.



The following Systems are part of the Simulation:
=================================================
- yaAGC as Apollo Guidance Computer Emulator
- The whole Lunar Module Apollo Guidance Software
- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- FDAI (Flight Director Attitude Indicator) inluding:
     + Yaw, Pitch and Roll Rate Indicators
     + Error Needles to display data under the subsequent modes:
         1.) DSKY: V61E -> DISPLAY DAP FOLLOWING ATTITUDE ERRORS
         2.) DSKY: V62E -> DISPLAY TOTAL ATTITUDE ERRORS WITH RESPECT TO NOUN 22
         3.) DSKY: V60E -> DISPLAY VEHICLE ATTITUDE RATES ON FDAI ERROR NEEDLES
- All Crew Switches connected to the AGC
- The Rotational (RHC) and Translational (THC) Hand Controller
- All binary AGC system inputs by providing check-buttons to change their status (e.g. Overtemperature)
- All binary AGC outputs by interpreting the different BIT combinations and presenting the status in a readable form
- A physical model to simulate the LM behavior in space.
     + The Calculation of the Moment of Inertia bases on the same hyperbola equation as used by the AGC state estimator
- The four quad RCS thruster system in conjunction with the above mentioned physical model
- Descent and Ascent Engine (Veryfied by Tsiolkovsky's Rocket Equation)
- Stage Separation
- A Bit-Monitor to trace the AGC inputs and outputs



Architecture Overview:
======================
LM-Simulator connects via TCP/IP directly to "yaAGC". To use a joystick (RHC/ACA), which is strongly 
recommended, Ron Burkey's program "yaACA" has to be started (not available for the stand-alone version).

-----------------              ---------------              -----------
|               |    TCP/IP    |             |    TCP/IP    |         |
| LM Simulator  | <----------> |    yaAGC    | <----------> |  yaACA  |
|               |              |             |              |         |
-----------------              ---------------              -----------



Configuration:
==============
If you start LM-Simulator without any parameter (wish lm_simulator.tcl) then it assumes a config file 
within the same directory called "lm_simulator.ini". If that config file is not available then 
LM-Simulator starts with internally defined standard values based on the LM-7 mission.


Command Line Configuration:
---------------------------
--port=PortNum          Changes the port number (by default, 19801) used to connect to yaAGC.  
                        This can also be changed in the configuration file.

--cfg=IniFilename       This option changes the name or directory of the configuration-file used.
                        By default, the file is "lm_simulator.ini", located in the installation directory.



Program-Menu Structure:
=======================
The program is divided into several sub-windows which can be called through the "Systems" menu:

Menu:                                Function:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit -> Clear Message Window         Clears the Log Window
Edit -> Exit                         Leaves the Program

Systems -> DSKY Lite                 Display/Keyboard interface to the AGC
Systems -> AGC Outputs               Monitoring and Correlating of the AGC Binary Outputs     
Systems -> AGC LM System Input       Simulation of all binary AGC input values
Systems -> AGC Crew Inputs           Crew switches, buttons, RHC/ACA, THC connected to the AGC
Systems -> FDAI / IMU                Flight Director Attitude Indicator which shows the
                                     LM attitude in relation to the Inertial Measurement Unit
Systems -> Simulation Monitor &      Monitor simulation parameter like thrust and amount of
           Control                   propellant and control the Descent- and Ascent-Engine 
                                     as well as the stage separation.

How to run LM Simulator in a Linux and Windows environment?
===========================================================
In a LINUX environment you need to have TCL/TK installed because LM Simulator has been written by using that
interpreter language.
Just do the following to start the application:
- Start the Apollo Guidance Computer Emulator: yaAGC
- As an option start the Rotational Hand Controller Interface for PC Joysticks: yaACA
- Finally start the LM-Simulator itself: wish lm_simulator.tcl
If you want to use the application within an MS Windows operating system then you can download a stand-alone
version which can be executed by a simple double click on lm_simulator.exe
