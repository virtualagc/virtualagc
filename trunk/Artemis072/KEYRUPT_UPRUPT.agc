# 'UPLINK ACTIVITY LIGHT' IS TURNED OFF BY .....

#	2.	ERROR RESET
#	3.	UPDATE PROGRAM (P27) ENTERED BY V70,V71,V72, AND V73.
#
#				      _
# THE RECEPTION OF A BAD CODE (I.E., CCC FAILURE) LOCKS OUT FURTHER UPLINK ACTIVITY BY SETTING BIT4 OF FLAGWRD7 = 1.
# THIS INDICATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GROUND BY THE DOWNLINK WHICH DOWNLINKS ALL FLAGWORDS.
# WHEN UPLINK ACTIVITY IS LOCKED OUT, IT CAN BE ALLOWED WHEN THE GROUND UPLINKS AN 'ERROR RESET' CODE.
# (IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE 'ERROR LIGHT RESET' CODE IS PRECEEDED BY 16 BITS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS 1 FOLLOWED
# BY 15 ZEROS. THIS WILL ELIMINATE EXTRANEOUS BITS FROM INLINK WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT OVER FROM THE ORIGINAL
# FAILURE).
#
# UPLINK ACTIVITY IS ALSO ALLOWED (UNLOCKED) DURING FRESH START WHEN FRESH START SETS BIT4 OF FLAGWRD7 = 0.
