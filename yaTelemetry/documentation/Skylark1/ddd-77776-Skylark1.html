    <p>CDUX,Y,Z. The actual values of the IMU CDU angles. Each register
      is an unsigned 15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and is updated
      by counter interrupts. A middle gimbal angle greater than 70
      degrees will light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the DSKY. When |MGA|
      exceeds 75 degrees, automatic maneuvers are inhibited. Whenever
      |MGA| exceeds 85 degrees the ISS stabilization loop will be
      disabled except during Average-G when the "config" window of
      DAPDATR1 indicates Saturn configuration. As a result, the CDUZ
      register should maintain values that correspond to middle gimbal
      angles between -70 degrees and +70 degrees.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>10b</h1>
    <p>CDUT. The optics trunnion angle CDU, scaled (degrees-19.7754)/45
      (two's complement). The angle measurement varies from -19.775° to
      45°, corresponding to a range of 0° to about 65° in actual
      trunnion. </p>
    <h1>11-13</h1>
    <p>ADOTs (if CSM-alone or Docked DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if
      TVC DAP on). ADOTs are DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e. the
      outputs from the CSM-alone or Docked DAP rate filter), roll, pitch
      and yaw, about the control axes. These axes are aligned with the
      RCS jet quads and, consequently, are rotated with respect to the
      NAV BASE axes, -7.25 degrees about +X. ADOTs are scaled (degrees/
      second)/450. OGARATE is the measured roll rate obtained by
      back-differencing the outer gimbal angle (OGA) measurements every
      0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>. This quantity will
      normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet failed-on could
      produce 2-3°/sec rates. OMEGABs are the measured attitude rates
      about the pitch and yaw body axes, obtained by transforming the
      back-differenced CDU readings taken each DAP sample period.
      OMEGAYB is computed each pitch DAP pass; OMEGAZB is computed each
      yaw DAP pass. The first OMEGAZB value when the TVC DAP is started
      (or after a hardware restart) is measured over 1.5 DAP sample
      periods. The time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the same as
      for the OMEGACs. The maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5
      deg/sec. <br>
      <br>
      <u>NOTE:</u> Even though OGARATE is computed and stored as a
      single precision quantity, it can be considered a double precision
      word in which the least significant half is always zero. This is
      insured by the TVC zeroing loop.<br>

    <p>AK,AK1,AK2.&nbsp; The X, Y and Z (roll, pitch and yaw,
      respectively) attitude errors used to drive the FDAI display,
      scaled degrees/180. The roll attitude error register (AK) is
      loaded with one-quarter the "raw" value during P11 and entry
      programs while Entry DAP is running, to increase the scale by a
      factor of four. The attitude errors are about the control axes for
      CSM-alone or Docked DAP and about the body axes for TVC and Entry
      DAP. Zeros in bits 15, 14 and 13 of DAPDATR1 and a one in bit 2 of
      Flagword 6 indicate that the Entry DAP is active. During CSM-alone
      or Docked DAP operation the particular error quantities depend
      upon the display mode selected, as follows: MODE 1 (selected by
      V61) results in Autopilot phase-plane errors; MODE 2 (selected by
      V62) results in total attitude errors with respect to the angles
      in N22; MODE 3 (selected by V63) results in total astronaut
      attitude errors with respect to the angles in N17. In MODE 1 the
      errors should generally remain less than the attitude deadband,
      ADB. The values are calculated every 200 ms during CSM-alone or
      Docked DAP operation, whereas in TVC DAP operation, AK is updated
      every 0.5 second in TVC EXECUTIVE with the complement of OGAERR,
      and AK1 and AK2 are updated every TVC DAP sample period (in PCOPY
      and YCOPY) with the respective values of ERRBTMP. The error
      needles themselves, however, are updated with AKs only every
      one-half second on a call from TVC EXECUTIVE. Also, with TVC DAP,
      AK will normally have a magnitude of less than 5 degrees but a jet
      failed-on could produce a diverging roll attitude. AK1 and AK2
      will normally have peak values of up to 3 degrees, converging to
      0-1 degrees with time.<br>

      radians/4. It will range at less than 200 n.mi. and is calculated
      each 2 seconds after the initiation of P63 until the end of P67.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>35</h1>
    <p>RDOT. Altitude rate. The radial component of velocity (negative
      if descending), scaled (feet/sec)/(2 × 25766.1973). This is a
      scalar component calculated in earth-centered reference
      coordinates. If bit 9, flagword 6 (RELVELSW) is zero, the velocity
      used is inertial. If bit 9, flagword 6 is a one, a velocity
      relative to air mass is used. The expected range of values runs
      from less than -7000 ft/sec to +1000 ft/sec and is calculated each
      2 seconds after P63 until the end of P67.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>36</h1>
    <p>THETAH. The range between the present position and the estimated
      landing site, expressed as an angle and scaled, degrees/360. The
      expected value is less than 180° It is calculated each 2 seconds
      after start of P63 until the end of P67. It is used in P61 for
      computing EMS display but is not on the Powered downlist.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>37</h1>
    <p>LAT(SPL). The geodetic latitude of the entry target, scaled
      degrees/360. A positive quantity denotes North while a negative
      quantity indicates South. This parameter is pad loaded or DSKY
      loaded when P61 or P62 is in progress.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>38</h1>
    <p>LONG(SPL). The longitude of the entry target scaled, degrees/360.
      A positive quantity indicates East while a negative quantity
      denotes West. This parameter is pad loaded or DSKY loaded when P61
      or P62 is in progress.<br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h1>39a</h1>
    <p>ALFA/180.&nbsp; The pitch attitude angle, used by ENTRY DAP and
      scaled, degrees/180. It is the third rotation of the CM body triad
      in the Euler sequence R, β, α, and is about <u>UBY</u>. The value
      range is ±180° and is calculated each 0.1 second after the DAP is
      turned on in P62. Operation of such is indicated by a non-zero
      value in bit 12, flagword 6. (Bits 1 and 2 are also non-zero.)<br>
    </p>
    <h1>39b</h1>
    <p>BETA/180. The yaw attitude angle, used by ENTRY DAP and scaled,
      degrees/180. It is the second rotation of the CM body triad in the
      Euler sequence R, β, α, and is about <u>UBZ</u>. The value range
      is ±90° and is calculated each 0.1 second after the DAP is turned
      on in P62. This state is indicated by a non-zero value in bit 12,
      flagword 6. (Bits 1 and 2 will also be non-zero.)</p>

    <p>R3D1 stands for digit one of the third register and VD1 stands
      for the first digit of the verb display, etc. For the right
      character of a pair, bit 5 is the MSB with bit 1 the LSB. For the
      left character of a pair, the MSB is bit 10 with bit 6 the LSB.
      Bit 11 of some of the DSPTABs contains discrete information, a one
      indicating that the discrete is on. For example, a one in bit 11
      of DSPTAB+1 indicates that R3 has a plus sign. If the sign bits
      associated with a given register are both zeros, then the content
      of that particular register is octal; if either of the bits is
      set, the register content is decimal data. The five bit codes
      associated with the digits are as follows:</p>

    CDUX,Y,Z. The actual values of the IMU CDU angles. Each register is
    an unsigned 15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and is updated by
    counter interrupts. A middle gimbal angle greater than 70 degrees
    will light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the DSKY. When |MGA| exceeds 75
    degrees, automatic maneuvers are inhibited. Whenever |MGA| exceeds
    85 degrees the ISS stabilization loop will be disabled except during
    Average-G when the "config" window of DAPDATR1 indicates Saturn
    configuration. As a result, the CDUZ register should maintain values
    that correspond to middle gimbal angles between -70 degrees and +70
    degrees.

    axes, -7.25 degrees about +X. ADOTs are scaled (degrees/
    second)/450. OGARATE is the measured roll rate obtained by
    back-differencing the outer gimbal angle (OGA) measurements every
    0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>. This quantity will
    normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet failed-on could
    produce 2-3°/sec rates. OMEGABs are the measured attitude rates
    about the pitch and yaw body axes, obtained by transforming the
    back-differenced CDU readings taken each DAP sample period. OMEGAYB
    is computed each pitch DAP pass; OMEGAZB is computed each yaw DAP
    pass. The first OMEGAZB value when the TVC DAP is started (or after
    a hardware restart) is measured over 1.5 DAP sample periods. The
    time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the same as for the
    OMEGACs. The maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec. <br>
    <br>
    <u>NOTE:</u> Even though OGARATE is computed and stored as a single
    precision quantity, it can be considered a double precision word in
    which the least significant half is always zero. This is insured by
    the TVC zeroing loop.<br>

    <p>ROLLTM.&nbsp; The roll attitude angle used by Entry DAP, scaled
      degrees/180. It is the first Euler rotation of the CM body triad
      about the negative relative velocity vector -<u>UVA</u>, along
      which <u>UBX</u> points. The value ranges ±180°, is calculated
      after the DAP is turned on in P62 and is updated each 0.1 second
      during its operating period. Operation is indicated by a non-zero
      in bit 12 of flagword 6.</p>

      value will range ±180° and is initially set in P62, based on
      HEADSUP, and holds until the drag exceeds 0.05g. The quantity will
      be computed each 2 seconds after P64 until the velocity becomes

      individual bits of which are used to indicate the source of a
      hardware restart and/or AGC warning. The channel is initialized to
      0 by a V36E (request fresh start). The channel will be zeroed by
      the final V33E on a P27 state vector uplink and also by a crew or
