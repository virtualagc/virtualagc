    <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; Telemetry documentation for this specific Lunar
    Module software version is not (yet) available, most likely due to
    an unavailable <i>Guidance System Operations Plan</i> (GSOP) for
    it.&nbsp; The documentation herein is based on assumptions about the
    contents of the unavailable GSOP documents, so do not assume that it
    is perfectly reliable.&nbsp; Careful examination of the source code
    for the AGC software version, if available, may provide additional
    detail in resolving questions; refer particularly to source-code

      error counter commands; 29a is trunnion, 29b is shaft.&nbsp; They
      are placed in the RR error counters and specify the rate at which
      the RR antenna is driven.&nbsp; Values range from +384 to -384 and
      vary according to the angular error between the present and
      desired RR positions.&nbsp; Calculated every 0.5 second in the
      Radar Designate Routine (DODES) whenever the LGC is driving the RR
      antenna which occurs when:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The RR monitor (R25) detects the antenna out of mode limits.</li>

            target vector which lies outside "the cone".&nbsp; ("The
            cone" is a mathematically-defined cone whose vertex is the
            origin of coordinates, whose axis is the 180° transfer
            direction, and whose semi-cone angle is specified to
            INITVEL.)&nbsp; The semi-cone angle is set to 15° by P34,
            P35, P74 and P75 because active vehicle transfer angles
            between 165° and 195° are normally avoided in the targeting
            procedure.&nbsp; However, if a transfer angle falling within
            this 180° ± 15° sector is intentionally selected by one of
            the targeting programs (P34 or P74), or results from one of
            the maneuver programs (P35 or P75) during an intercept
            trajectory targeted for more than 180°, the Lambert Aim
            Point Maneuver Prethrust Routine increases the semi-cone
            angle to 45° so that active vehicle transfer angle will not
            change from inside to outside the cone angle during the
            powered maneuver.&nbsp; Such a condition is undesirable
            since the intercept trajectory would be retargeted during
            the powered maneuver.&nbsp; Likewise, if the initial
            transfer central angle falls outside the 15° semi-cone
            angle, the semi-cone angle is decreased to 10° to reduce the
            possibility of a transfer angle changing from outside to
            inside the cone during a powered maneuver.&nbsp; NORMSW

    <p>R3D1 stands for digit one of the third register and VD1 stand for
      the first digit of the verb display, etc.&nbsp; For the right
      character of a pair, bit 5 is the MSB with bit 1 the LSB.&nbsp;
      For the left character of a pair, the MSB is bit 10 with bit 6 the
      LSB.&nbsp; Bit 11 of some of the DSPTABs contains discrete
      information, a one indicating that the discrete is on.&nbsp; For
      example, a one in bit 11 of DSPTAB+1 indicates that R3 has a plus
      sign.&nbsp; If the sign bits associated with a given register are
      both zeros, then the content of that particular register is octal;
      if either of the bits is set, the register content is decimal
      data.</p>

    <p>RR TRUNNION and SHAFT ERROR COUNTERS.&nbsp; Rendezvous Radar
      error counter commands; 79a is trunnion, 79b is shaft.&nbsp; They
      are placed in the RR error counters and specify the rate at which
      the RR antenna is driven.&nbsp; Values range from +384 to -384 and
      vary according to the angular error between the present and
      desired RR positions.&nbsp; Calculated every 0.5 second in the
      Radar Designate Routine (DODES) whenever the LGC is driving the RR
      antenna which occurs when:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The RR monitor (R25) detects the antenna out of mode limits.</li>

    A magnitude of 384 corresponds to a rate command of about 10

    <p>PIPTIME1.&nbsp; The time at which the accelerometers were read
      (associated with words 96-98, but since the group is not a
      snapshot quantity, their values as transmitted may not be valid
      simultaneously).&nbsp; When the PIPAs are read, the time is stored
      in PIPTIME1; when the state vector is updated, the contents of
      PIPTIME1 is stored in PIPTIME.&nbsp; Scaled centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>,
      referenced to computer clock.<br>

    <h1>96-98</h1>
    <p>DELVs (X, Y, Z).&nbsp; The accumulated PIPA counts when the
      servicer is running.&nbsp; At the start of each 2-second cycle the
      PIPAs are zeroed and the contents of the PIPAs are loaded into
      DELVs.&nbsp; In stable member coordinates.&nbsp; Scaled
      (centimeters/second)/2<sup>14</sup>.<br>

    <p>PSEUDO55.&nbsp; Filled with exactly what goes into Counter 558
      whenever Counter 558 is filled by the landing throttle program
      (once every 2 seconds during landing).&nbsp; Scaled lbs/2.817 × 2<sup>14</sup>).<br>

    <p>TGO.&nbsp; Calculated time to engine cutoff.&nbsp; Calculated
      every 2 seconds during P40, P42 (after burn starts).&nbsp; Also
      calculated 5 seconds before ignition in P40, P42.&nbsp; Scaled
