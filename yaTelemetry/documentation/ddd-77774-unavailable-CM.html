    <p>CSM STATE VECTOR and TIME. The CMC's latest calculated state
      vector for the CSM in either earth-centered or moon-centered
      reference coordinates. During the Orbital Integration Routine, the
      sphere of influence will be indicated by Flagword 8, bit 12
      (CMOONFLG): zero = earth-centered; one = lunar-centered. It is
      important to note that the Average-G routine is initialized with a
      state in RN, VN which can have a different origin than is
      indicated by CMOONFLG. This means an inconsistency in the Downlink
      of the state vector actual origin and CMOONFLG origin. Words 2-4
      contain the position components, X, Y, Z, scaled meters/2<sup>29</sup>,
      Words 5-7 contain the velocity components, X, Y, Z, scaled
      (meters/centisecond)/2<sup>7</sup>. Word 8 contains the time
      associated with the CSM state vector in words 2-7, scaled
      centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>, referenced to the computer clock.
      These parameters are calculated whenever the CSM state vector is
      permanently extrapolated or changed.<br>

    <h1><a name="10"></a>9a,9b,10a</h1>
    <p>CDUX (outer gimbal) CDUY (inner gimbal) CDUZ (middle gimbal): The
      actual values of the IMU CDU angles. Each register is an unsigned
      15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and is updated by counter
      interrupts. A middle gimbal angle greater than 70 degrees will
      light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the DSKY. Whenever the magnitude of
      the MGA exceeds 85 degrees the ISS stabilization loop will be
      disabled. As a result, the CDUZ register should maintain values
      that correspond to middle gimbal angles between -70 degrees and
      +70 degrees.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>10b</h1>
    <p>CDUT. The optics trunnion angle CDU, scaled (degrees -
      19.7754)/45 (two's complement). The angle varies from -19.775° to
      +45°. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>11-13</h1>
    <p>ADOTs (if RCS DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if TVC DAP on).
      ADOTs are the RCS DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e. the
      outputs from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw, about
      the control axes. These axes are aligned with the RCS jet quads
      and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV base axes,
      -7.25 degrees about +X. ADOTs are scaled, (degrees/second)/450.
      OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured roll rate obtained by
      back-differencing the outer gimbal angle (OGA) measurements every
      0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>, This quantity will
      normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet failed-on could
      produce 2-3°/sec rates. OMEGABS, in words 12 and 13, are the
      measured pitch and yaw attitude rates about the body axes,
      obtained by back-differencing the CDU readings every TVC DAP
      sample period. The time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the
      same as for the OMEGACs, described in words 85-87 of the Powered
      downlist. The maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>14a,14b,15a</h1>
    <p>AKs. The X, Y and Z (roll, pitch and yaw, respectively) attitude
      errors used to drive the FDAI display, scaled degrees/180, The
      roll attitude error register (AK +0) is loaded with one-quarter
      the "raw" value during P11 (and entry programs while Entry DAP is
      running, although the cell is not telemetered then) to increase
      the scale by a factor of four. The attitude errors are about the
      control axes for RCS DAP and about the body axes for TVC and Entry
      DAP. Zeros in bits 15, 14 and 13 of DAPDATR1 and a one in bit 2 of
      Flagword 6 indicate that the Entry DAP is active, During RCS DAP
      operation the particular error quantities depend upon the display
      mode selected, as follows: MODE 1 (selected by V61) results in
      Autopilot phase-plane errors; MODE 2 (selected by V62) results in
      total attitude errors with respect to the angles in N22; MODE 3
      (selected by V63) results in total astronaut attitude errors with
      respect to the angles in N17, In MODE 1 the errors should
      generally remain less than the attitude deadband, ADB, (either 0.5
      degree or 5 degrees as selected in DAPDATR1). The values are
      calculated every 200 ms during RCS DAP operation, whereas in TVC
      DAP operation, AK is updated every 0.5 second in TVC EXECUTIVE
      with the current value of OGA, and AK 1 and AK 2 are updated every
      TVC DAP sample period (in PCOPY and YCOPY) with the respective
      values of ERRBTMP. Also, with TVC DAP, AK will normally have a
      magnitude of less than 5 degrees but a jet failed-on could produce
      up to 30 degrees. AK 1 and AK 2 will normally have peak values of
      up to 10&nbsp; (3 in some software versions) degrees, converging
      to 0-4 (0-1 in some software versions) degrees with time.<br>

    THETADX, THETADY, THETADZ. During normal RCS DAP operation, when the
    CMC Mode switch is in AUTO or HOLD and there are no RHC commands,
    these registers contain the desired current, (i,e., of this DAP
    cycle opposed to final) roll, pitch, and yaw CDU angles, treated as
    15-bit unsigned fractions and scaled degrees/360, These quantities
    are used in the computation of phase plane attitude errors and are
    calculated as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>During automatic maneuvers they are updated every 100
        milliseconds.</li>
      <li>During attitude hold they are constants (the desired CDU
        angles to be held).</li>
      <li>At the end of manual rate maneuvers, after rate damping is
        complete, THETADX, Y &amp; Z are set to the current CDU angles.</li>
      <li>During manual rate maneuvers and when in FREE mode the
        registers are not updated. </li>

    <h1>18</h1>
    <p>TIG. The time of ignition (prethrust) or time of cutoff (while
      thrusting). The changeover in definition occurs at ignition if an
      impulsive burn and at first TGOCALC (nominal TIG+2) if steering.
      This item is scaled, centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>. It undergoes a
      single-shot calculation by P39, P34 and P35 (prethrust, time of
      ignition); a single-shot update by P40 for slipped TIG when
      integration for AVE G cannot be completed in time (time of
      ignition); a single-shot computation of the time of engine cutoff
      by P40 impulsive burn logic; or two-second updates of time to
      engine cutoff, initiated at the first steering pass (nominal
      TIG+2). Upon engine failure, the most significant half of TIG is
      set to -24<sub>8</sub>, and the least significant half remains
      unchanged. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>19</h1>
    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">DELLT4 (The desired
        transfer time) The time from TIG until the target (RTARG) is
        reached, scaled centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>. It is used as an
        input to the INITVEL subroutine and calculated by each user of
        this subroutine. <br>
      </font></p>
    <h1><a name="20"></a>20-22</h1>
    <p>RTARG. The aimpoint vector X, Y, Z, in either earth-centered or
      lunar-centered coordinates and scaled meters/2<sup>29</sup>. The
      origin of the coordinate system is the same as that of the CSM
      state vector at TIG. Caution must be exercised in ground/AGC
      communications whenever the spacecraft is operating near the
      "sphere-of-influence" switchover point. Bit 12, flagword 8
      (CMOONFLG) indicates whether the CSM state vector is earth- or
      moon-centered. This parameter is calculated in P34/P74, P35/P75,
      P38/P39, P78/P79 and updated in the Initial Velocity Subroutine. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>23</h1>
    <p>TGO, The time to go until engine cutoff, scaled centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>.
      At TIG-5, for an impulsive burn (TGO &lt;6) TGO is calculated once
      and represents the time from now until engine cutoff. If the
      estimated maneuver time is greater than six seconds, active
      steering is used and TGO becomes the length of time from the last
      PIPA reading to engine cutoff. During this steering burn, TGO is
      calculated each two seconds from start steer to stop steer, Start
      steer begins at TIG+2 for nominal TIG-0 ignition and at TIG+4 for
      slipped ignition. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>24</h1>
    <p>PIPTIME1. The time (T2/T1) at which the PIPAs are read, scaled
      centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>. Integration stores the preread state
      vector time in anticipation of reading PIPAs at that time. PIPASR
      stores TIME2/TIME1 every two seconds during Average g (TIG-30 to
      P40/41 exit; etc.). Since the group is not a snapshot quantity,
      their values as transmitted may not be valid simultaneously. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>25-27</h1>
    <p>DELVs. The sampled X, Y, &amp; Z PIPA accumulations (velocity
      increments) with compensation for PIPA bias and scale factor
      errors. These quantities are in the stable member coordinate
      system and are scaled, (cm/sec)/(5.85 × 2<sup>14</sup>.
      Calculation takes place every two seconds during AVE G, The
      variation with time and the range of values depend on the
      acceleration level and compensation. There is a zeroing of all
      low-order components and a momentary zeroing of DELVY and DELVZ
      prior to the loading of PIPA contents into respective high-order
      words (part of READACCS, or REREADAC task). PIPA compensation
      follows in Servicer job (inhinted, so that all or not PIPA
      compensation shows up). <br>
    </p>
    <h1>28</h1>
    <p>PACTOFF (pitch), YACTOFF (yaw). The SPS engine gimbal-actuator
      trim angle estimates in the pitch and yaw planes (used to align
      the engine with the vehicle cg), scaled (seconds of arc)/(85.41 ×
      2<sup>14</sup>), These values are added to the DAP filter output
      every DAP sample period as part of the engine gimbal servo
      command, The variation is usually less than ±2 degrees over the
      course of a burn, These are the upper halves of the
      double-precision registers, PDELOFF and YDELOFF. These items are
      set initially by astronauts in P40 (R03). They change
      significantly at switchover which is about 3.4 seconds after
      ignition for CSM; 6.4 seconds for CSM/LM. Incremental changes are
      made every 0.5 second after switchover and an end-of-burn update
      is made following the engine shut-down command, <br>
    </p>
    <h1>29</h1>
    <p>PCMD (pitch), YCMD (yaw). The pitch and yaw SPS engine
      gimbal-actuator position commands from the respective TVC DAPs,
      scaled (seconds of arc)/(85.41 × 2<sup>14</sup>). The expected
      range of values is between ±1 degree, while the maximum possible
      values are ±6 degrees. They are calculated at every TVC DAP sample
      period: 40 ms for CSM, 40, 80 ms for CSM/LM. <br>

    <p>CSTEER. The Cross Product Steering Constant, "c", used by P40/P41
      in the equation Δ<u>m</u> = c<u>b</u>Δt - Δ<u>v</u> and certain
      prethrust computations. It is scaled "c"/4. The least significant
      half of this word will always be made a +0 whenever CSTEER is set
      to ECSTEER or zeroed. The value range will be from -4 to +4 (less
      one bit). It is set by P40 prethrust to ECSTEER if a Lambert burn.
      It will be zeroed by P40 prethrust if an external ΔV burn and also

            defined as a difference between "present" attitude and an
            attitude specified in N22 or N17. Consequently, these
            attitude errors may assume large values. The phase plane
            attitude errors, however, are quantities used by the RCS DAP
            to command jet firings when the CMC MODE SWITCH is in AUTO
            and HOLD and thus should generally remain within the

            whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset) target
            vector which lies inside the cone"; reset to 0 by INITVEL
            whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset) target
            vector which lies outside "the cone". ("The cone" is a
            mathematically-defined cone whose vertex is the origin of
            coordinates, whose axis is the 180° transfer direction, and
            whose semi-cone angle is specified to INITVEL.) The
            semi-cone angle is set to 15° by P34, P35, P38, P39, P74,
            P75, P78, and P79, because active vehicle transfer angles
            between 165° and 195° are normally avoided in the targeting
            procedure, However, if a transfer angle falling within this
            180° ± 15° sector is intentionally selected by any one of
            the above targeting programs, or by the results from any one
            of the above maneuver program during an intercept trajectory
            targeted for more than 180°, the Lambert Aim Point Maneuver
            Prethrust Routine increases the semi-cone angle to 45° so
            that active vehicle transfer angle will not change from
            inside to outside the cone angle during the powered
            maneuver. Such a condition is undesirable since the
            intercept trajectory would be retargeted during the powered
            maneuver. Likewise, if the initial transfer central angle
            falls outside the 15° semi-cone angle, the semi-cone angle
            is decreased to 10° to reduce the possibility of a transfer
            angle changing from outside to inside the cone during a
            powered maneuver. NORMSW is set to 0 by P31 and P37 because
            the semi-cone angle should be set to 10° for these programs.
            NORMSW should generally remain 0, unless transfers between
            165° and 195° are intended. NORMSW is equivalent to the

            a desired sign of the radial velocity of the final radius
            (to indicate whether trajectory is to be inbound or outbound
            here) which would require a transfer past the hyperbolic
            asymptote of the conic. For example, a spacecraft which is
            inbound can never return inbound to a radius which is
            greater than its current radius, and likewise a spacecraft
            which is outbound can never return outbound to a radius

    CDUX (outer gimbal) CDUY(inner gimbal) CDUZ (middle gimbal):&nbsp;
    The actual values of the IMU CDU angles.&nbsp; Each register is an
    unsigned 15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and is updated by
    counter interrupts.&nbsp; A middle gimbal angle greater than 70
    degrees will light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the DSKY. Whenever the
    magnitude of the MGA exceeds 85 degrees the ISS stabilization loop
    will be disabled except during Average-G when the "config" window of
    DAPDATR1 indicates Saturn configuration.&nbsp; As a result, the CDUZ
    register should maintain values that correspond to middle gimbal
    angles between -70 degrees and +70 degrees.<br>

    CDUT.&nbsp; The optics trunnion angle CDU, scaled

    ADOTs (if RCS DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if TVC DAP on).&nbsp;
    ADOTs are the RCS DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e. the outputs
    from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw, about the
    control axes.&nbsp; These axes are aligned with the RCS jet quads
    and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV base axes,
    -7.25 degrees about +X.&nbsp; ADOTs are scaled,
    (degrees/second)/450.&nbsp; OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured
    roll rate obtained by back-differencing the outer gimbal angle (OGA)
    measurements every 0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>.&nbsp;









    This quantity will normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet
    failed-on could produce 2-3°/sec rates.&nbsp; OMEGABs in words 12
    and 13, are the measured attitude rates about the pitch and yaw body
    axes, obtained by transforming the back-differenced CDU readings
    taken each DAP sample period.&nbsp; OMEGAYB is computed each pitch
    DAP pass; OMEGAZB is computed each yaw DAP pass.&nbsp; The first
    OMEGAZB value when the TVC DAP is started (or after a hardware
    restart) is measured over 1.5 DAP sample periods.&nbsp; The time
    sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the same as for the OMEGACs,
    described in words 85-87 of the Powered List.&nbsp; The maximum
    OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec.<br>
    <h1>64a,64b,65a</h1>
    AKs.&nbsp; The X, Y and Z (roll, pitch and yaw, respectively)
    attitude errors used to drive the FDAI display, scaled
    degrees/180.&nbsp; The roll attitude error register (AK+0) is loaded
    with one-quarter the "raw" value during P11 and entry programs while
    Entry DAP is running, to increase the scale by a factor of
    four.&nbsp; The attitude errors are about the control axes for RCS
    DAP and about the body axes for TVC and Entry DAP.&nbsp; Zeros in
    bits 15, 14 and 13 of DAPDATR1 and a one in bit 2 of Flagword 6
    indicate that the Entry DAP is active.&nbsp; During RCS DAP
    operation the particular error quantities depend upon the display
    mode selected, as follows:&nbsp; MODE 1 (selected by V61) results in
    Autopilot phase-plane errors; MODE 2 (selected in V62) results in
    total attitude errors with respect to the angles in N22; MODE 3
    (selected by V63) results in total astronaut attitude errors with
    respect to the angles in N17.&nbsp; In MODE 1 the errors should
    generally remain less than the attitude deadband, ADB, (either 0.5
    degree or 5 degrees as selected in DAPDATR1).&nbsp; The values are
    calculated every 200 ms during RCS DAP operation, whereas in TVC DAP
    operation, AK is updated every 0.5 second in TVC EXECUTIVE with the
    complement of OGAERROR, and AK 1 and AK 2 are updated every TVC DAP
    sample period (in PCOPY and YCOPY) with the respective values of
    ERRBTMP.&nbsp; The error needles themselves, however, are updated
    with AKs only every one-half second on a call from TVC
    EXECUTIVE.&nbsp; Also, with TVC DAP, AK will normally have a
    magnitude of less than 5 degrees but a jet failed-on could produce a
    diverging roll attitude.&nbsp; AK1 and AK2 will normally have peak
    values of up to 3 degrees, converging to 0-1 degrees with time.<br>

    THETADX, THETADY, THETADZ.&nbsp; During normal RCS DAP operation,

    Fresh Start. FAILREG and FAILREG+1 are also reset to zero by use of
    the "ERROR RESET" keycode. FAILREG contains the first alarm code
    received after the "ERROR RESET", FAILREG+1 contains the second, and
    FAILREG+2 will always contain the most recent alarm code. Octal

    PIPA's. The accumulation of output pulses from the X,Y, and Z
    accelerometers (a measure of the velocity changes), scaled
    (centimeters/second)/(5.85 × 2<sup>14</sup>). These registers are
    zeroed by PIPUSE (called by LASTBIAS which is called by PREREAD at
    the start of AVEG). They are then read and zeroed every two seconds
    by READACCS (or REREADAC) throughout AVEG.<br>
    <h1>74</h1>
    ELEVATION ANGLE. The angle between the local horizontal plane of the
    active vehicle and the line of sight vector to the passive vehicle
    at TPI. The scaling is degrees/360. This parameter is an input (N55)
    to P34/P74 (preset to 0); also to P32/P72 and P31 (preset to
    208.3°). Also set to 0 on final pass through P34 (elevation option)
    in MINKEY. The angle is measured in a counter clockwise rotation
    from the forward-direction path of the active vehicle (determined by
    the positive direction of the active vehicle's velocity vector) to
    the active-passive line of sight vector.<br>
    <h1>75</h1>
    <p>CENTRAL ANGLE. The angle traversed by the passive vehicle between
      TPI time (TTPI) and intercept time (TPASS4), scaled degrees/360,
      This item can be computed by the TPI Search program or inputted
      via the DSKY and it is used in computing the time of flight
      (TPASS4-TTPI), It is calculated once during each pass through P17
      (TPI Search). <br>

    <p>ERRORX, ERRORY, ERRORZ. The RCS DAP phase plane (roll, pitch,
      yaw) attitude errors scaled degrees/180. During steady state
      operation the magnitude of ERRORX, Y, and Z should be less than
      the attitude deadband, ADB, (either 0.5 deg. or 5 deg.). When the
      CMC mode switch is in AUTO or HOLD, a magnitude greater than the
      ADB which exists for long intervals without diminishing at the
      rate as specified in DAPDATR1 would be an indication of bad RCS
      DAP performance. The RCS control axes, with which these errors are
      concerned, are rotated, with respect to the body axes, by -7.25
      degrees about the +X axis. The error values are calculated: <br>
