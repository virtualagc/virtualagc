## Filename:    SYSTEM_TEST_STANDARD_LEAD_INS.agc
## Purpose:     A section of LM131 revision 1.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the final
##              release of the flight software for the Lunar Module's (LM)
##              Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 13. The code has
##              been reconstructed from a listing of Luminary 131 and a dump
##              of a core rope memory module B5, part number 2010802-171,
##              which is the only module different between LM131 revision 1
##              and Luminary 131. The executable generated from this source
##              has been verified against the module dump, so while the names,
##              comments, and ordering may not be exactly correct, the
##              resulting binary is.

# E/BKCALL	FOR DOING BANKCALLS FROM AND RETURNING TO ERASABLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE IS CALLABLE FROM ERASABLE OR FIXED.  LIKE BANKCALL, HOWEVER, SWITCHING BETWEEN S3 AND S4
# IS NOT POSSIBLE.
#
# THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS:
#
#	TC	BANKCALL
#	CADR	E/BKCALL
#	CADR	ROUTINE		WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN FIXED.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY TERMINATE, BAD STALL OR TC Q.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY PROCEED OR GOOD RETURN FROM STALL.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY ENTER OR RECYCLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE REQUIRES TWO ERASABLES (EBUF2, +1) IN UNSWITCHED WHICH ARE UNSHARED BY INTERRUPTS AND
# OTHER EMEMORY PROGRAMS.
#
# A + L ARE PRESERVED THROUGH BANKCALL AND E/BKCALL.

		MASK	LOW10		# GET CURRENT EBANK.  (SBANK SOMEDAY)
		ADS	EBUF2	+1	# FORM BBCON.  (WAS FBANK)
		NDX	EBUF2

		TC	SWCALL		# GO TO ROUTINE, SETTING Q TO SWRETURN
					# AND RESTORING A + L.
