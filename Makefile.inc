# Mod history:	2016-10-04 JL   Created.
#               2016-10-04 JL   Added format target.
#		2016-10-05 JL	Re-enable HTML output.
#		2016-10-11 RSB	The executable and html are now built separately,
#				rather than in one step, since they actually 
#				need different command-line switches in yaYUL
#				for optimum prettiness.
#		2016-10-21 RSB	Hadn't been accounting for the fact that 
#				oct2bin need different args for --block1.
#		2016-11-07 RSB	The 2016-10-11 change must have broken building
#				the HTML for Validation.agc, which in turn
#				broke the ability to build the installer
#				for VirtualAGC.
#		2016-11-11 RSB	Added the (optional) EXTRA_TARGETS.
#               2024-05-13 RSB  Updated the notes to cover the case of having
#                               *only* a binary file but no *.agc files.
#		2025-01-13 RSB  Now allow the calling Makefile to override the
#				assignment of TOPLEVEL within this file.
#				Basically, if that's done it allows the AGC
#				program to reside in a single source-code file
#				that's not named MAIN.agc.

# Notes: 
#
#  1. `BASENAME` must be set to the flight name in the calling Makefile.
#
#  1A.By default, we expect the top-level AGC source-code file to be named
#     MAIN.agc.  If the AGC source code fits into a single source-code file
#     that you don't want to be named MAIN.agc, and more-likely want to be
#     the same as the `BASENAME`, the calling Makefile should define the
#     variable `TOPLEVEL`, such as
#                TOPLEVEL=$(BASENAME)
#     or whatever's appropriate.
#
#  2. Define `NO_BINSOURCE for those missions that do not have a binsource file.
#
#  3. For normal missions, a binsource is used to generate a known-good bin 
#     image, and the output of yaYUL is compared against it to check for 
#     correctness. 
#
#  4. For `Validation`, or for missions where we do not have a known-good 
#     image, the bin file generated by yaYUL is used as is. 
# 
#  5. To get yaYUL to generate HTML output, define `GEN_HTML`.
#
#  6. If you have nothing *but* a binary file, and no *.agc files, in place of
#     including this Makefile.inc it's better for the calling Makefile to
#     have this:
#               #include ../Makefile.inc
#               .PHONY: clean default
#               default:
#               clean:

# Used by the install target, whatever that's for.
