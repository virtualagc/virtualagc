        align="right"></a>The purpose of this project is to provide
    computer simulations of the onboard guidance computers used in the
    Apollo Program's lunar missions — but <i>primarily</i> the Apollo
    Guidance Computer (AGC) used in the Command Module and the Lunar
    Module —, and to generally allow you to learn about these guidance
    computers.&nbsp; Since the resources available in this project have
    ballooned so much over the years, exploring it for the first time
    can be quite intimidating.&nbsp; We invite you to look at our <a
      href="ForDummies.html">"kinder and gentler" introductory page</a>
    before immersing yourself in the full, gory detail presented by the
    bulk of the website.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Also, if you have some specific interests and don't want to wade
    through a bunch of stuff unrelated to them, the search bar at the
    top of this page might help.&nbsp; This quick cheat sheet might help
    too:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're interested in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) ...</li>

            Module</a> and <a href="Luminary.html">for the Lunar Module</a>.&nbsp;

    The video clip above (courtesy of user Dean Koska and YouTube)
    illustrates some of the cute things you can do with Virtual AGC if
    you're of a mind to do so.&nbsp; Dean compiled our <a
      href="yaAGC.html">simulated AGC CPU</a> to run on a Palm
    Centro—explaining that a regular Palm was too slow.&nbsp; He created
    his own simulated display/keypad ( <a href="yaDSKY.html">DSKY</a>),
    presumably aided by the <a href="developer.html">developer info</a>
    we provide for just such a desire.&nbsp; (And sorry, Dean's Palm
    port isn't provided from our <a href="download.html">downloads page</a>.)<br>
    <br>
    Here are some other video clips (courtesy of Niklas Beug and
    YouTube) which take a little longer to watch (20 minutes), but are
    perhaps even more instructive.&nbsp; <a href="yaAGC.html">Our
      simulated AGC software</a> has been integrated into <a
      href="https://github.com/dseagrav/NASSP/tree/master">the NASSP
      add-on</a> for <a href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/">the
      Orbiter space-flight simulator</a>, and is used there to fly
    simulated Apollo or Apollo-like missions.&nbsp; And you can fly such
    simulated missions&nbsp; too, using that software, as if you were
    Neil Armstrong yourself ... assuming you're up the challenge!&nbsp;
    The videos below show simulated Apollo 11 and 15 lunar landings,
    using our AGC and the actual original Apollo 11 and Apollo 15
    guidance-computer software running on it.&nbsp; Of course, all the
    fancy graphics is NASSP/Orbiter's and not ours, but the AGC is
    behind the scenes, helping to run the spacecraft, and the
    accompanying text describes how the AGC is being used!&nbsp; The
    Apollo 15 video is quite exciting, as the LM swoops in over the
    Lunar Apennine Mountains to the landing site in Hadley Rille.&nbsp;
    (I suppose I should also mention that Nik provided these videos in
    full HD Quality, though you'll only see a much-reduced quality in
    the tiny boxes below, so you might want to head over to YouTube
    itself to watch them, if you want to get the full glory of the
    things.)<br>

    <h2><a name="What_Is_An_AGC_"></a><small><big>What are "Block I",
          "Block II", the "AGC", "AGS", "LVDC", and "OBC"?</big><br>
      </small></h2>
    "AGC" stands for <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>pollo <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">G</span>uidance <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>omputer.&nbsp; The AGC was the
    principal onboard computer for NASA's Apollo missions, including all
    of the lunar landings.&nbsp; Both the Command Module (CM) and the
    Lunar Module (LM) had AGCs, so two AGCs were used on most of the
    Apollo missions, but with differing software.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    computer and its software were developed at MIT's Instrumentation
    Laboratory, now known as Draper Labs.<br>
    <br>
    The "block II" AGC, employing the AGC4 instruction set, is the
    particular computer model in which we're interested, most of the
    time. The block II AGC was used not only on Apollo 7 through Apollo
    17 (including all actual lunar landings), but also on three Skylab
    missions, on the Apollo-Soyuz test mission, and on a <a
href="http://www.klabs.org/history/history_docs/reports/dfbw_tomayko.pdf">fly-by-wire






      research project using F-8 aircraft</a>. Nevertheless, only 57
    AGCs were constructed—and 138 display-keyboard units (DSKYs) for
    them—and all of the ones installed in the Lunar Modules were not
    returned to the Earth—so they are definitely collector's items. <br>
    <br>
    There was also the "block I" model of the AGC, which predated the
    block II model.&nbsp; The block I model was supposed to fly in
    Apollo 1 and 2.&nbsp; But since Apollo 1 was tragically destroyed by
    fire, and Apollo 2 never flew, the block I model was never used in
    any manned mission.&nbsp; It was, nevertheless, used in the unmanned
    Apollo 3, 4, and 6 missions.<br>
    <br>
    And of course, don't forget the "block III" model of the AGC, which
    ... wait just one second there, buddy!&nbsp; Anyone who has done any
    reading at all about Apollo, knows there's no such thing as the
    block III AGC.&nbsp; Okay, that's true, but one of the original AGC
    developers, Hugh Blair-Smith, developed some thoughts in his spare
    time about what a block III AGC might look like, and has been kind
    enough to send them to us.&nbsp; If you're an advanced student of
    the AGC who has already absorbed everything there is to know about
    the block II system, <a href="BlockIII.html">you might be
      interested in reading what Hugh has to say about it</a>.<br>
    <br>
    "AGS" stands for <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>bort <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">G</span>uidance <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">S</span>ystem, of which the computer
    portion was known as the Abort Electronics Assembly (AEA).&nbsp; The
    AGS/AEA was a completely separate computer system from the AGC, with
    a different architecture, different instruction-set, different
    runtime software, and designed/manufactured by different groups than
    the AGC.&nbsp; It was in the LM as a kind of backup for the AGC, but
    was only supposed to be used (as the name implies) in case of an
    aborted landing.&nbsp; It's sole purpose was to get the LM from
    wherever it was back into lunar orbit, so that the CM could
    rendezvous with the LM.<br>
    <br>
    The "LVDC" ( <span style="font-weight: bold;">L</span>aunch <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">V</span>ehicle <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">D</span>igital <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>omputer) had yet a different
    architecture, instruction set, software, and manufacturer.&nbsp; It
    was a computer mounted in the Saturn rocket itself, and its
    responsibility was to control the firing of the rocket engines to
    give the rocket the proper trajectory.&nbsp; It was discarded when
    the CSM discarded the rocket, and consequently was used during only
    a very short time interval relative to the total length of the
    mission.<br>
    <br>
    The Gemini spacecraft also had an <b>O</b>n <b>B</b>oard <b>C</b>omputer





    (OBC), having a similar functionality to the Apollo AGC, though with
    greatly reduced capabilities and sophistication, but with a computer
    architecture very similar to the Apollo LVDC.<br>
    <br>
    Because we have much more information about the AGC than we do about
    the AGS,&nbsp; LVDC, and OBC, the bulk of this website and of the
    Virtual AGC project in general concentrates on the AGC.&nbsp;
    Coverage of the other computers is mostly confined to the <a
      href="yaAGS.html">AGS page</a>, <a href="LVDC.html">LVDC page</a>,
    and the <a href="Gemini.html">Gemini</a> <a href="Gemini.html">page</a>
    of this website.&nbsp; And similarly, there is much more discussion
    of the block II AGC than of the block I AGC.<br>
    <h2><a name="What_Virtual_AGC_Is"></a>What "Virtual AGC" Is</h2>
    <i>Virtual AGC</i> is a computer model of the AGC. &nbsp;It does not
    try to mimic the <span style="font-style: italic;">superficial</span>
    behavioral characteristics of the AGC, but rather to model the AGC's
    <i>inner workings</i>. &nbsp;The result is a computer model of the
    AGC which is itself capable of executing the original Apollo
    software on (for example) a desktop PC.&nbsp; In computer terms,
    Virtual AGC is an <span style="font-style: italic;">emulator</span>.&nbsp;
Virtual






    AGC also provides an emulated AGS and (in the planning stages) an
    emulated LVDC and OBC.&nbsp; "Virtual AGC" is a catch-all term that
    comprises all of these.<br>
    <br>
    The current version of the Virtual AGC software has been designed to
    work in Linux (including Raspberry Pi), in Microsoft Windows, and in
    Mac OS X.&nbsp; It also works in at least some versions of
    FreeBSD.&nbsp; <br>
    <h2><a name="What_Virtual_AGC_Is_Not"></a>What Virtual AGC Is Not</h2>
    In and of itself, Virtual AGC is not a full-fledged flight
    simulator, nor a lunar-lander simulator, nor even a behavioral
    simulation of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) or Command-Module (CM)
    control panels.&nbsp; (In other words, if download and run our
    software and expect a realistic LM control panel to suddenly appear
    on your computer screen, you'll be disappointed.)&nbsp; Virtual AGC
    can be used, however, as a <span style="font-style: italic;">component</span>
    of such a simulated spacecraft, and developers of such software are
    encouraged to do so.&nbsp; Indeed, some developers already have, and
    you may have seen a sample video near the top of this page of such a
    simulation in operation!&nbsp; In particular, there is full support
    for our AGC and AGS emulations in <a
      href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/">the Orbiter space-flight
      simulator</a> with <a
      href="https://github.com/dseagrav/NASSP/tree/master">the NASSP
      add-on</a>. <br>
    <h2><a name="Principal_Elements_of_Virtual_AGC_"></a><small><big>Existing
Elements






          of the Virtual AGC Project</big></small></h2>
    <p>This isn't exactly an exclusive list, but some of the important
      things we provide in the Virtual AGC project proper are listed
      below.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>AGC Elements<br>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>yaAGC</b> is an emulation of the AGC CPU.&nbsp; To
        function, it requires a LM or CM "core rope" binary (see below).<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>yaDSKY</b> is a simulation of the Display/Keyboard used in
        Apollo. &nbsp;It supplies input to <b>yaAGC</b>, or receives
        output from it.&nbsp; The design of the emulator is modular, so
        the DSKY simulation may be easily replaced if you don't care for
        mine, or if you want to replace it with a complete control-panel
        simulation.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> is a
        simulation of various other Guidance &amp; Navigation (G&amp;N)
        system components, such as the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU),
        an FDAI ball, an alternative simulated DSKY, and a monitor for
        the AGC's i/o-channel activity.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> is a dumb
        terminal on which telemetry downlinks from <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> may be viewed, similar
        to the way such telemetry from the AGC was originally viewed by
        Mission Control.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> is a program
        that emulates the LM's hand-controller (possibly with a
        joystick), and to communicate the desired pitch/roll/yaw changes
        to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.</li>
      <li><b>yaYUL</b> is an assembler, capable of converting AGC4
        assembly language programs like <b>Luminary</b> or <b>Colossus</b>
        (see below) into the binary executable format (a "core rope")
        needed by the AGC.</li>
      <li><b>Luminary</b> is the name of the original 1960's and 1970's
        software used for the Apollo Lunar Modules in the actual
        missions.&nbsp; Both binary executable (needed by <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>) and source code
        (needed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>) are
        provided.&nbsp; We have many, many versions of this software,
        for different missions.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Colossus</b> is the name of the original 1960's and 1970's
        software used for many (but not all) of the Apollo Command
        Modules.&nbsp; As with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>,
        both binary and source are provided, and we have many versions
        of the software.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Validation</span> is the name
        of a newly-created AGC assembly-language program that provides a
        validation suite for helping to assure that the implementation
        of the virtual CPU is correct.<br>
      </li>
      <li>We have 1000+ scans of many, many of the original Project
        Apollo documents in our document library.</li>
      <li>We're making an ongoing effort to provide hardware support
        (both electrical and mechanical) for the original AGC and DSKY
        designs, and for the Guidance &amp; Navigation (G&amp;N) system
        in general:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Tens of thousands of scans of the original G&amp;N
          electrical and mechanical drawings.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>Many electrically-accurate transcriptions of AGC/DSKY
          electrical drawings in a modern CAD (Computer Aided Design)
          system.</li>
        <li>Translations of into AGC electrical design into the Verilog
          for simulation of the AGC electrical circuitry.</li>
        <li>(Coming real soon now.)&nbsp; 3D-models created from
          AGC/DSKY mechanical design files, for 3D printing.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>AGS Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> is an emulation
        of the AGS CPU.&nbsp; To function, it requires a binary of one
        of the flight programs (see below).</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> is a simulation

    <h2><a name="Licensing"></a>Licensing</h2>
    In general, software not original to Project Apollo is copyrighted
    by the original author, usually Ron Burkey (me!), but is provided to
    you as "free software" under the GNU <a href="http://www.fsf.org">General





      Public License</a> (GPL), though a few programs have been
    explicitly put into the public domain.&nbsp; Software originally
    from Project Apollo (such as <b>Luminary</b> and <b>Colossus</b>)
    is in the public domain, to the best of my non-lawyer
    understanding.&nbsp; Newly-written or revised documentation is being
    placed in the public domain.<br>
    <br>
    Note that if you want to use <b>yaAGC</b> or <b>yaDSKY</b> as
    components of a more-complete Apollo simulation, the modularity of
    the design allows them to be run as stand-alone programs (whilst
    communicating with your own software), and doing so does not force
    any particular licensing requirements upon your own code.
    &nbsp;However, if you choose instead to <span style="font-style:
      italic;">incorporate</span> the code directly into your program or
    to link to it, your program will itself need to be licensed under
    the GPL unless you feel like negotiating an alternate license with
    me.<br>
    <br>
    By "negotiate", I don't mean I'll charge you any money, but merely
    that I want to make sure it would be appropriate to give you an
    alternate license.&nbsp; By way of illustrating what I mean, the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> source code license
    includes&nbsp; a "special exception" as allowed/required by the GPL,
    allowing linking to the non-free <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span>
    spacecraft-simulator SDK libraries, which are free of charge but <i>not</i>
    under a GPL-compatible license.&nbsp; And as long as you are making
    your program freely available in the same way as <b>Orbiter</b>
    does, I would be very inclined to offer you such a special exception
    as well ... but you have to talk to me about it, and won't get it
    just by imagining it's okay.&nbsp; Refer to the <a
      href="developer.html">Developer info</a> page for more detail.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, you could develop your own AGC simulator if you don't
    feel like asking me for a non-GPL license for mine.&nbsp; It's not
    as if it's rocket science ... oh, but wait .... <img alt=""

    <h2><a name="Running_the_Emulator"></a>Running the Emulator ... or,
      A Brief Introduction to the GUI<br>
    </h2>
    What I'll discuss here is merely how to run the pure Virtual AGC
    software as provided directly by this project.&nbsp; If you want to
    run a full-up spacecraft simulation like <a
      href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/">Orbiter</a> with <a
      href="https://github.com/dseagrav/NASSP/tree/master">the NASSP
      add-on</a>, you'll have to look at the NASSP documentation
    instead.<br>
    <br>
    The first step, of course, is to download the Virtual AGC software
    and install it or build it for the computer platform you're using,
    by following the instructions on the <a href="download.html">download






      page</a>.&nbsp; While the Virtual AGC project provides many
    different programs that implement bits and pieces of the full
    emulation, and which can be run separately if you need to craft the
    various options for your own purposes, the only program you normally
    need to worry about running is the one that's actually <span
      style="font-style: italic;">called</span> <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp; <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> is a GUI front-end
    which allows you to choose almost any reasonable set of options
    related to the emulation, and then to run all of the emulation
    programs needed, in a way that allows those programs to
    intercommunicate properly.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Hopefully, <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> is
    itself simple enough that it really requires very little explanation
    to use, and your troubles will really begin only after the emulation
    is actually running!&nbsp; But I'll provide a very brief overview
    here.&nbsp; There's also <a href="yaTelemetry.html#VirtualAGC">a
      more detailed explanation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span></a>
    available for your enjoyment.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Screenshot of
        VirtualAGC program." src="Screenshot-VirtualAGC.jpg"
        style="border: 2px solid;" width="1147" height="966"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The screenshot above (or a reduced-size variation, depending on your
    screen size or the command-line options you use) depicts the one and
    only window of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    program.&nbsp; There are no menus, toolbars, hot-buttons, or other
    controls.&nbsp; While a large number of options are presented, you
    don't necessarily need to change any of the selected options.&nbsp;
    The defaults are as shown, and if you simply click the "Run!" button
    at the bottom of the window, the simulation will run, as which point
    various simulation windows will pop up.&nbsp; If you change any of
    the settings, the program will remember those changes and the
    settings you've selected will be the ones that appear the next time
    you run <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or,






    you could click the "Defaults" button at the bottom of the window to
    restore all of the settings to their defaults.&nbsp; There's really
    very little reason for a complete newcomer to change any of the
    settings, but you will note that you can choose from among the
    several available sets of AGC software for different Apollo missions
    in the pane labeled "Simulation Type."<br>
    <br>
    When the simulation runs, <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>'s
rather






    large window will courteously disappear to conserve space on your
    screen, to be replaced by a other popups such as the simulated DSKY
    or a telemetry window, and will only return when the simulation
    ends.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    To end the simulation, simply exit from any of the visible elements
    of the simulation—though there's a bit of platform to platform
    variation as to which components are easily terminated, so I'd
    recommend closing the DSKY.&nbsp; Within a few seconds all of the
    other elements of the simulation will automatically terminate.&nbsp;
    Note, however, that the automatic closing of all the simulation
    windows isn't active until several seconds (5 in most versions, 30
    in some) have passed from the time the simulation started up, so if
    you start a simulation and then immediately decide to shut it down,
    you'll still have to wait a little while for the process to
    complete.&nbsp; Also, on Mac OS X, there are various windows that
    simply may not close automatically,&nbsp; and these will simply have
    to be closed manually from their main menus.<br>
    <h2><a name="Quick_Start"></a>Quick Start</h2>
    I expect that anyone who would <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span>
    use Virtual AGC would likely want to adapt it quite a bit, and so
    any simple instructions I might give wouldn't help much.&nbsp; Not
    to mention the burden of training yourself on the technical
    nitty-gritty of Apollo systems before you can actually <span
      style="font-style: italic;">use</span> the AGC for anything!&nbsp;
    :-)&nbsp; But here are a few scenarios where you can quickly get to
    the point of seeing <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span>
    happen, if not necessarily anything meaningful to our sad little
    earthbound minds.&nbsp; But there are still a few things you can try
    that are amusing in a geekish sense.
    <h3><a name="Running_the_Validation_Suite_"></a>Running the
      Validation Suite<br>
    </h3>
    There is a "validation suite", which has been written from scratch
    in AGC assembly language, that attempts to check that each CPU
    instruction is implemented correctly in the AGC simulator.&nbsp; You
    won't get the "Apollo experience" by running it, but at least you'll
    be executing real AGC assembly-language code:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> as
        described above, select the "Validation Suite" choice in the
        "Simulation Type" area, and hit the "Run!" button. &nbsp;</li>
      <li>On the DSKY, you'll see 00 appear in the PROG and NOUN fields,
        and you'll see the OPR ERR&nbsp; annunciator will light.&nbsp;
        This means that the validation program is ready to start.&nbsp;
        Press the DSKY's PRO key to start the program.&nbsp; The OPR ERR
        annunciater will turn off to indicate that the command was
        accepted.</li>
      <li>After several tens of seconds, 77 will appear in the PROG
        field and the OPR ERR annunciator will light.&nbsp; If anything
        other than 77 appears in the PROG field, then the numbers in the
        PROG and NOUN fields will indicate which area of the test
        failed.&nbsp; (You can press PRO again to proceed with the
        remaining tests.)<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">Because of some current bugs
            (07/19/04) in the way I initialize Colossus, there will be
            some program alarms at startup, and the PROG indicator will
            light to inform you of this.&nbsp; You can view the alarms
            by keying in V05N09E at the DSKY.&nbsp; (In normal AGC
            shorthand, 'V' is short for "VERB", 'N' is short for "NOUN",
            and 'E' is short for "ENTR".&nbsp; So "V05N09E" means to hit

            Program alarms 1105 and 1106 happen to be "downlink too

            of the numerical registers.&nbsp; After about 5 seconds, the

            Because of a bug in the simulator (as of 07/19/04), the PROG

            memory is divided into 36 banks, numbered 00-43
            (octal).&nbsp; A so-called "bugger word" has been stuck at
            the end of each bank—no comments on this terminology,
            please, since I didn't invent it; when I asked Don Eyles
            some question that involved them, he somewhat-laconically
            stated "we called them check sums"—which causes the checksum
            of the bank to come out to a known value.&nbsp; This known
            value is the same as the bank number when possible, and is
            the logical complement of the bank number otherwise.&nbsp;
            (For example, the checksum of <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">Colossus</span> bank 00007 is 00007, but the
            checksum of bank 00006 is 77771.&nbsp; Both are
            correct.)&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>'s
"show-banksum"






            program can be used to display the bank numbers, one by
            one.&nbsp; You can execute the show-banksum program by
            keying in V91E on the DSKY.&nbsp; After a few seconds, the
            statistics for bank 00 will be shown:&nbsp; R1 (the topmost
            5-digit display) will contain the computed checksum; R2 will
            contain the bank number; and R3 will contain the bugger
            word.&nbsp; Each of the displays will be in octal, as
            indicated by the fact that the +/- sign is blank.&nbsp; To
            advance to the next bank, key in V33E.&nbsp; (Hitting the
            PRO key does the same thing.)&nbsp; If you have the patience
            to advance through each of the banks, the next V33E (or PRO)
            after bank 43 will wrap-around to bank 00 again.&nbsp; To
            terminate the show-banksum program, you can key in V34E.<br>
            <br>
            By the way, the bank-6&nbsp; bugger word shown (05143) is
            for Colossus 249.&nbsp; If you ran the Artemis 072 program,
            it would have been 04275, while if you ran the Luminary 131

            In case you make a mistake, you can clear R1 any time before

            00004.&nbsp; This just happens to be the first instruction
            executed after power-up.&nbsp; It is an <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INHINT</span> instruction,
            and disables interrupts.&nbsp; The contents of R2 (the
            middle 5-digit register) are not cleared, and thus are just
            whatever lingers from before.<br>

            forth, up to 03400-03777 for memory bank E7.&nbsp;
            Alternately, you can "monitor" a memory location (i.e., get
            updates for it once per second) by using VERB 11 rather than
            VERB 01.&nbsp; For example, V11N02E25E will monitor register
            25, the "TIME1" register, which is an internal counter that
            increments every 10 ms.&nbsp; In general, of course, the
            numbers won't mean much unless you reference them to the
            Colossus 249 assembly listing.<br>
            <br>
            In the accompanying screenshot, we actually do look at the
            TIME1 register, and discover that at that instant it
            contained the value 20245 (octal).&nbsp; Of course, you'll
            see something different.&nbsp; Display R2 is not changed, so

    using the hand-controller (joystick), see the orientation of the
    spacecraft change on the 8-Ball, fire the thrusters, etc.&nbsp; The
    instructions for his tutorial are actually build into the program
    itself, so I'll just tell you enough to read his tutorial rather
    than duplicating the tutorial's information here:<br>

      <li>Since you will be using the ACA simulation (joystick) for
        this, <a href="yaTelemetry.html#Usage_of_yaACA3">you may need
          to do a little configuration of the joystick first</a>, or
        risk finding out that (say) you have no yaw control.<br>

        can unclick the AEA simulation if you like.&nbsp; The Telemetry
        monitor won't be directly used either, but I like it so much I'd
        never advise you to deselect it.)</li>

    <p><img src="V21N27E10E-PROG.png" alt="" width="196" height="223"
        align="right">One nice thing about open-source software (which
      our Virtual AGC Project is!) is that other people are free to
      incorporate the software within their own projects, and thus it
      can see a more-rapid diffusion into a wider sphere of usage than
      would have been possible if (say) it was just me developing it by
      myself.&nbsp; In the case of Virtual AGC, one thing that has been
      done with it is that it has been incorporated into <a
        href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/">the Orbiter Space Flight
        Simulator system</a>, via the <a
        href="http://nassp.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page">Project
        Apollo NASSP add-on</a>, which people then use to fly very
      realistic or imagined Apollo missions.&nbsp; The NASSP folks have
      been kind enough to incorporate the capability of logging
      interactions between the simulated AGC and simulated DSKY, with
      the result that we can "play back" (though not interact with) such
      realistic logged activity on the simulated DSKY.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This capability is only available in Virtual AGC software
      versions 2017-12-11 and later, and it works as follows:&nbsp; if
      you left-click on the PROG lamp indicator with the mouse, a
      file-dialog will open up.&nbsp; Of course, in the <i>real</i>
      DSKY, PROG was not a button; it was merely a lamp.&nbsp; But we've
      assigned it this additional function in our simulated DSKY.&nbsp;
      In the file-dialog, select the pre-recorded script<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>Apollo8-launch.canned</tt><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As you may imagine, this is a recorded Apollo 8 launch sequence,
      which takes about 15 minutes to play back.&nbsp; You'll see
      various things in watching it:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>PROG 02, VERB 75.&nbsp; The script begin at T-40, i.e., 40
        seconds prior to launch, and in this state the AGC simply waits
        to receive an ignition signal from the Saturn rocket ... or
        technically, what it will eventually receive is the "liftoff
        discrete" from the S-IVB stage.&nbsp; Program 02 is the Gyro
        Compassing Program, and its purpose is "to provide the stable
        member orientation for launch".&nbsp; The "stable member" is a
        part of the inertial measuring unit (IMU) which holds the
        gyroscope (for determining the spacecraft orientation) and the
        accelerometers.&nbsp; The astronaut doesn't actually have to
        select Program 02, because it is automatically selected by
        Program 01 (the initialization program), which was run prior to
        T-40, and hence you won't see it in the playback.<br>
      </li>
      <li>PROG 11, VERB 06, NOUN 62.&nbsp; At ignition, the AGC
        automatically transitions from Program 02 to Program 11, the
        Earth Orbit Insertion Monitor Program.&nbsp; Realize that the
        AGC itself was not able to control the Saturn rocket itself,
        other than the Saturn IVB stage, and the Saturn was controlled
        instead by its own internal computer, <a href="LVDC.html">the
          LVDC</a>. The AGC's real work began later! Nor did the AGC
        receive any information from the LVDC as to the quantities it is
        monitoring and displaying on the DSKY.&nbsp; The LVDC and AGC
        separately each had access to their own inertial measurement
        units (IMUs) that measured the acceleration and orientation of
        the spacecraft, and by mathematically integrating this data from
        the IMU, the LVDC and AGC could independently figure out
        everything they needed to know about the current state of motion
        of the rocket ... and hopefully the LVDC and AGC would come up
        with very similar results.&nbsp; So this monitoring activity is
        much less trivial that it may sound to you at first.&nbsp; As
        for what's actually being monitored in this program, the AGC is
        driving the FDAI (i.e., the "eight ball" or "attitude
        indicator") is being driven to show the astronaut the
        orientation of the rocket in a nice graphical way, though the
        FDAI is not a part of the DSKY.&nbsp; But the AGC is also
        computing trajectory parameters and displaying them on the
        DSKY.&nbsp; Those parameters, from top to bottom, are "VI" (the
        inertial velocity magnitude, in feet per second), "H DOT" (the
        rate of change of altitude above the launch pad, also in feet
        per second), and "H" (the height above the launch pad, in tenths
        of a nautical mile).<br>
      </li>
      <li>PROG 11, VERB 16, NOUN 50.&nbsp; After a few minutes, the
        astronaut has initiated this monitoring command.&nbsp; You'll
        notice that the KEY REL lamp is flashing, because the previous
        monitoring (VERB 16, NOUN 62) wasn't actually terminated but
        merely temporarily interrupted, and the astronaut is being
        warned that when he terminates the VERB 16 NOUN 50 monitoring
        he'll automatically return to the other monitoring.&nbsp; As for
        what's being monitored here, from top to bottom, it's the
        "splash error" (in tenths of a nautical mile), and a couple of
        other items about which the documentation is inconsistent.&nbsp;
        The "splash error" part sounds a bit confusing, but apparently
        in Program 11 it has nothing to do with splash-down, but is
        rather the negative of the range to target.<br>
      </li>
      <li>... and so on.&nbsp; Eventually, after this phase of the
        mission is completed, the astronaut keys in VERB 37 ENTR 00 ENTR
        to return to program 00, and then keys in VERB 66.&nbsp; I'm not
        sure why the latter was done.&nbsp; It was for transferring
        state vectors (i.e. the position, velocity, and orientation)
        from the LM's AGC to the CM's, or vice-versa.&nbsp; But of
        course, for Apollo 8 there was no LM.&nbsp; Oh well, I'm
        inexcusably ignorant, so it's probably the correct thing to do!<br>

            passed.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Oops! the test has failed.&nbsp; That's because the
            self-test is pretty thorough; it tests not only memory
            checksums, but also the operation of various CPU
            instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The possible error codes here are:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> +000000 &nbsp; Test still

            I was having a little problem with the instruction set when
            this screenshot was taken, thus the self-test failed.&nbsp;
            Fortunately, the AGS flight programs have been written to
            continue operating in the case of self-test failure, even
            though it is "not recommended".&nbsp; The current version of
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> actually does
            pass the self-test, and so you'll see a code of +100000

            operations listed above are very representative from the
            user-interface perspective of all the other kinds of
            operations you can perform on the DEDA.&nbsp; There are
            basically two classes of DEDA-based operations:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Get a running display of the contents of a memory
                location.&nbsp; The command sequence for this is <span

                    style="font-style: italic;">OctalDigit1 OctalDigit2
                    OctalDigit3</span> READOUT</span> .&nbsp; Upon
                receiving this command, the AGS CPU will monitor the
                selected memory location and display it on the DEDA
                every 1/2 second.&nbsp; You can pause the readout by
                hitting <span style="font-family: monospace;">HOLD</span>,
                or resume it by hitting <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">READOUT</span> again.&nbsp; The flight
                software will automatically scale the data or otherwise
                modify it (by changing units of measurement) in a way
                appropriate to the particular memory location before
                displaying the data.&nbsp; If you make a mistake in the
                key sequence, the OPR ERR lamp will light, and you'll
                have to hit <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLR</span>
                to clear the error condition.</li>
              <li>You can change the value of a location of
                memory.&nbsp; In doing so, the flight software may
                choose to interpret your action as a command to perform
                some further action, but I'm not up to speed on what
                those other actions might be.&nbsp; The command sequence
                is <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLR <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">OctalDigit1 OctalDigit2

                    italic;">Digit1 Digit2 Digit3 Digit4 Digit5</span>
                  ENTR</span> .&nbsp;&nbsp; The 5-digit data may be
                octal or decimal, but that is dependent on the
                particular memory location chosen, and isn't a choice
                that the astronaut/user makes.&nbsp; Again, a mistake in
                the sequence will cause the OPR ERR lamp to light.</li>
            </ol>
            Of course, there are operations the astronaut/user can
            perform that are outside of this framework, such as hitting
            the ABORT button or downloading the spacecraft state vector
            from the AGC.&nbsp; However the abort button is a separate
            switch rather than being a part of the DEDA, and I've not
            perfected AGC-to-AGS communication yet.<br>

      (for the advanced student)</h3>
    Prior to the descent of Apollo 14's LM to the lunar surface, a short
    in the LM control panel caused the abort switch to be triggered
    intermittently.&nbsp; If this actually happened during the landing,
    an abort would have automatically occurred (meaning that the lower
    stage of the LM would have been jettisoned and the upper stage would
    have blasted back into space).&nbsp; No landing would have been
    possible, and the astronauts would have faced the grave situation of
    needing rescue by the command module.&nbsp; It was therefore
    necessary, in the orbit or two before descent, for the some of the
    software designers to work out a fix for this problem that allowed a
    software lockout of the abort switch during the initial phase of the
    descent, but also allowed reenabling the abort switch later in the
    descent, in case the astronauts needed to use it.&nbsp; They did, in
    fact, work out such a fix.&nbsp; Your mission, should you choose to
    accept it, is this:&nbsp; Work out such a fix and send it to
    me.&nbsp; Remember, your fix can only involve erasable memory, since
    the core-rope containing the program cannot be altered.&nbsp; The
    fix needs to be keyed in at the DSKY by the astronauts.&nbsp; You
    have about 90 minutes to figure it out.&nbsp; Go!<br>

    Use Virtual AGC as a clock for your PC desktop.&nbsp; (My word, this
    software is versatile!)&nbsp; I'd suggest using the "DSKY Type" of
    "Half-size" for this.&nbsp; Use the <a href="#MonitorTime">instructions
given






      above</a> for setting and monitoring the time.&nbsp; You'll have
    to reset the time very morning, because the "hours" will not wrap
    around to 0 after 24.&nbsp; (And besides, the timers will overflow
    after 2<sup>28</sup>/100 seconds, or just over 31 days.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint:</span>&nbsp; Once you get
    this working well, you'll want to be able to start this up
    automatically, and not have to run <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    every time.&nbsp; Well, when <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    runs the simulation, it does so by creating batch files (in Windows)
    or a shell script (in Linux or Mac OS X), then simply running those
    batch files or shell scripts.&nbsp; When you run a custom program in
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, you use the
    "More" button in the simulation window to show you the contents of
    those batch files or shell scripts.&nbsp; So you can reuse or adapt
    those files for starting up your own simulation.<br>
    <br>
    Actually, we now have <a href="DIY.html">a "do it yourself" page</a>
    that gives a lot of helpful information on the topic of creating
    your own custom AGC code.&nbsp; In fact, it provides sample AGC code
    that actually implements the clock app, without requiring you to
    manually enter the time at power-up or every morning.&nbsp; Check it

    <h3>AGC Software Developers<br>
    </h3>
    Of course, it goes without saying that the greatest thanks go to the
    original software developers of the Apollo project, even if I've
    never personally had any contact with most of them.&nbsp; Hugh
    Blair-Smith needs to be specially mentioned, since his activities
    had a special relevance to my own project, and since he has
    patiently allowed me to pepper him with many questions.&nbsp; Don
    Eyles as well has made himself especially available, and has
    provided huge amount of software and documentation to us.&nbsp; But
    we are told that as many as 300-400 programmers contributed to the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> source code.&nbsp;
    Though not specifically a <span style="font-style: italic;">software</span>
    developer, Eldon C. Hall also has been very specifically helpful to
    me; Fred Martin, and Jim Kernan have also turned out be particular
    heroes in terms of the operation of this project. <br>
    <br>
    I've not yet uncovered a "full" list of the AGC software
    developers.&nbsp; But we're not totally helpless in figuring out at
    least a partial list.&nbsp; <a
      href="Documents/Memo-Lickly681007_text.pdf">A memo by Dan Lickly
      (a developer himself) about software testing</a> gives us a list
    developers who were responsible for specific "programs", "routines",
    and "areas" within LUMINARY, as of October 1968, and another,
    more-abbreviated <a href="Documents/LUM6_text.pdf">memo by George
      Cherry</a> gives a similar list as of January 1968.&nbsp; Some of
    the folks in those memos are known <i>not</i> to have been AGC

    Of course, we can't assume from this snapshot in time of one
    specific program (LUMINARY, but not COLOSSUS) that these were the
    only folks involved, nor even necessarily the most-significant
    ones.&nbsp; We know that some of the original developers of these
    software items had already moved on, and so it wouldn't be
    surprising if some of these "responsible" folks on the list were
    basically trainees who maintained software that was already mature
    and never needed any changes.&nbsp; Or perhaps not!&nbsp; We can't
    tell from just the list by itself.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Indeed, you can get a very different outlook if you look at the
    program comments within the software itself.&nbsp; For example, in
    the list above, John Vella and Marjorie Besas are responsible for
    PINBALL (the display/keyboard program); what does the source code
    for PINBALL itself tell us?&nbsp; Well, the software neglects to
    tell us who wrote PINBALL originally, but it does show a
    modification by "FILENE" in 1967, and another by "BARNERT" in 1969,
    but neither Filene nor Barnert is on the list above.<br>
    <br>
    If we do poke around in the AGC software source code, we can come up
    with a competing list of the programmers who originally wrote or
    modified the code.&nbsp; But many in the seemingly faceless mob who
    wrote the software never thought to tell you who they were at
    all.&nbsp; Here's the list of the ones that did choose to identify
    themselves, along with a sprinkling of names that I got through
    personal correspondence with developers.&nbsp; There's some overlap
    with the list above, but not much!<br>

    It should go without saying that by singling out coders, I don't
    mean to imply that hardware design, system architecture, or even
    program management is not important.&nbsp; The AGC hardware was
    certainly pretty revolutionary for its time, in terms of
    miniaturization and reliability.&nbsp; And indeed, the electrical
    schematics we have are littered with signatures, initials, and dates
    of the responsible folks ... tiny, illegible smudges of names in our
    scans of them.&nbsp; So in the end, we only know a tiny (but
    important) subset of those involved.<br>
    <br>
    A <span style="font-style: italic;">complete</span> AGC honor roll
    would need to include names like Charles Stark Draper and many
    others.&nbsp; But the Virtual AGC project certainly emphasizes the
    software aspects of the AGC over the hardware aspects, so the
    software developers are the ones particularly being honored here. As
    it happens, developer Peter Volante has sent me a bunch of org
    charts showing a little bit about how the MIT Instrumentation Lab's
    internal Apollo organization evolved over time, and many of the
    names listed above appear in those org charts, though in a
    more-structured way:<br>

      <li>I'm grateful to the folks at MIT's Dibner Institute's
        now-discontinued History of Recent Science and Technology
        website for making the scans of <span style="font-weight:

        responsible for providing the online version of <span

        David Mindell for helping me to move in the right direction with

        valuable information about the available AGC-related material at

      <li>Gary Neff deserves a big vote of gratitude for having the
        foresight (and presumably fortitude) to create the page scans of
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> 131 software
        source code.&nbsp; Without those I wouldn't even have attempted
        this project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Neff has also been extremely
        helpful in supplying me with quite a lot of replacement scans
        for garbled pages (52 of them so far) in the currently-available
        online versions of&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>

          things.</li>
        <li>Mike Stewart for using his hardware-based AGC simulator to

        to note adequately here, but I've tried to acknowledge you
        throughout the website where your contributions are
        relevant.&nbsp; If I've unfairly overlooked you, attribute it to
        a 1201 alarm in my brain; let me know and I'll fix it.</li>

    <h2><a name="Solution_to_the_Apollo_14_Final_Exam"></a>Solution to
      the Apollo 14 "Final Exam" Problem</h2>
    Above, we semi-jokingly proposed as a <a
      href="#Final_exam_for_the_advanced_student_">"final exam" problem</a>
    a situation which actually occurred during Alan Shepard and Edgar
    Mitchell's attempt to land the LM during the Apollo 14
    mission.&nbsp; <a
      href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14AbortDiscrete.html">Paul
      Fjeld has provided a lot of detail about this at the Apollo Lunar
      Surface Journal</a>, by consulting mission transcripts.&nbsp; Our
    Onno Hommes has also gotten an explanation directly from Don Eyles,
    the AGC developer who solved the final exam problem in real time
    during the mission and, as far as I know, the only AGC coder ever to
    be dramatized (in the Apollo 14 episode of <span style="font-style:
      italic;">From the Earth to the Moon</span>).&nbsp; And <a
      href="http://www.doneyles.com/LM/Tales.html">Don has written about
      it himself</a> (among many other stories) pretty interestingly, in
    a fairly popularized way. &nbsp; But here's the detailed solution,
    in as nearly Don's words as we can make it:<br>
    <br>
    <table summary="" style="text-align: left; width: 75%; margin-left:
      auto; margin-right: auto;" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"
      border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(204,
            204, 204);"> The procedure developed to work around the
            erroneous abort signal on Apollo 14 was as follows:<br>
            <br>
            (1) After the NOUN 62 countdown starts (an automatic display
            of the countdown toward engine ignition), but before
            ignition, key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> VERB 21 NOUN 1 ENTER 1010
              ENTER<br>
              107 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            to set the mode register to 71 to indicate that an abort had
            already occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the numbers are in
            "octal" (i.e. based on the root of 8 not 10) so that the
            number "107" actually means "71".<br>
            <br>
            (2) Exactly 26 seconds after ignition, manually advance the
            descent engine throttle to 100%.<br>
            <br>
            (3) Key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER 101
              ENTER<br>
              200 ENTER 1 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            to enable the landing guidance equations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
            equations were prevented from starting automatically because
            the mode register is set to the phony value of 71.<br>
            <br>
            (4) Key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER 105
              ENTER<br>
              400 ENTER 0 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            to explicitly disable the abort monitor. This clears the <span
              class="e">FLAGWORD</span> bit that controls the abort
            monitor.<br>
            <br>
            (5) Key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> VERB 21 NOUN 1 ENTER 1010
              ENTER<br>
              77 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            to set the mode register to its proper value of 63.<br>
            <br>
            (6) Return the manual throttle to its minimum
            setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The throttle stays at 100% because it is
            now being commanded by the guidance
            equations.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this step were omitted the
            throttle would be forced to stay at 100% when the guidance
            equations later request partial thrust, with bad effects. </td>

    Of course, I bet it seems pretty obvious <span style="font-style:

    Nik Beug has made a YouTube video illustrating actual use of this
    fix, using our AGC simulation built into the Orbiter spacecraft
    simulator as part of <a
      href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nassp/">the NASSP project</a>.&nbsp;
The






    video actually illustrates two scenarios:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>For the first couple of minutes, shows what would the actual
        spurious abort have looked like.&nbsp; (Answer:&nbsp; It
        separates the ascent and descent stages of the LM, and takes the
        ascent stage back into orbit.&nbsp; You don't die, but you don't
        land!)</li>
      <li>The remainder of the video shows how to enter the fix, prevent
        the spurious abort, and proceed to the surface.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Enjoy!<br>
