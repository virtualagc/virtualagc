The prettify lexer extensions agc,aea and apollo can be used to add syntax highligthing to HTML pages with AGC/AEA assembly in them.


USAGE
-----
<html><head><meta content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" http-equiv="content-type">
<title>AGC/AEA Assembly Listing</title></head>
<link href="./prettify.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="./prettify.js" type="text/javascript" onerror="alert('Error: failed to load ' + this.src)"></script>
<script src="./lang-apollo.js" type="text/javascript" onerror="alert('Error: failed to load ' + this.src)"></script>
</head>
<body  onload="prettyPrint()">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
<pre class="prettyprint lang-apollo">
	ASSEMBLY CODE HERE
</pre></span></body></html>


If you want to use the specific agc or aea language extensions replace the literal "apollo" with either agc or aea. The reason for having one lexer (i.e. lang-apollo) for both assembly languages is to have a common HTML lead in structure for the VirtualAGC HTML assembly listings and it allows potentially the .s files to be decorated if google accepts the lang-apollo extension so both the .s of AGC and AEA would be decorated using one single lexer extension.

When using prettify make sure the doc paths to the .js and .css files are proper.

For example:

Assuming the directory structure:

<path>/source/Artemis072
<path>/source/Colossus249
<path>/source/FP6
<path>/source/FP8
<path>/source/Luminary131
<path>/source/Prettify

Make sure the paths in the above template to the .css and .js files are like:
../Prettify/prettify.css
../Prettify/prettify.js
../Prettify/lan-apollo.js

NOTES
-----

Google Chrome seems to render these things extremely fast. 
However Firefox and IE work fine they just are slower when dealing with 
large HTML pages like the assembly listings. IE has the worst performance.
