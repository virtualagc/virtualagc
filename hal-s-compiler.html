    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
    <p>It is not feasible at the present time to run the original Shuttle-era version of the compiler for the HAL/S language to compile Space Shuttle flight software.&nbsp; Refer to <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle.html">our Space Shuttle flight-software page</a> for more context.<br></p>
    <p>That orginal HAL/S compiler was known as <tt>HAL/S-FC</tt>.&nbsp; Even if it were possible to run that original compiler, it would in any case produce only object code which could be run on an IBM System/360 mainframe, or else on the IBM AP-101S General Purpose Computers (GPC) of the Shuttle itself ... neither of which (with certain provisos insofar as System/360 is concerned) can be run on "modern" computers likely to be available or useful to most folks interested in this Virtual AGC Project website.<br></p>
    <p>Therefore, for the Shuttle flight software to be generally accessible, we instead need modern versions of several HAL/S-related development tools, including at minimum:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A HAL/S compiler.</li>
      <li>A linker for HAL/S object code.</li>
      <li>An emulator for HAL/S executable code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ideal HAL/S emulator and executable-code format would be such that the emulator could be easily integrated with spaceflight-simulation systems such as Orbiter or FlightGear, and would execute the HAL/S software rapidly and efficiently, supporting the entire HAL/S language and its entire feature set.<br></p>
    <p>The "ideal" just mentioned is quite difficult to achieve in one giant leap forward, and so I intend to achieve it in two stages, which I refer to as "preliminary" and "advanced".&nbsp; Potentially even-more-advanced stages may follow those, and I suppose there may be potential intermediate stages as well, but I don't care to speculate about them at the present time.&nbsp; I expect to implement the entire preliminary stage entirely by myself, but I also expect that help (any volunteers?) will be needed to reach the advanced stage.<br></p>
    <p>Sections below are devoted to a summary of the roadmap, and to the (in-progress, partially-implemented) preliminary version of the compiler.<br></p>
    <h1><a name="Roadmap"></a>Roadmap</h1>
    <p>In brief, the "modern" HAL/S compiler is structured as follows:<br></p>
    <ol>
      <li>A preprocessor.</li>
      <li>A combined tokenizer+parser.</li>
      <li>A code generator.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because modules of HAL/S code may be separately compiled, thus producing multiple output object-code files, an additional linker program is potentially needed to combine the object-code files into a single executable file.<br></p>
    <p>To produce efficient code, it is likely that some additional optimizer program will be needed for processing the object-code files and/or executable files, so eliminating redundant or useless instructions, replacing code sequences by more-efficient code sequences, and so on.<br></p>
    <p>Finally, unless the executable file is itself natively executable on the target computer system, then it will necessarily be in some format that must itself be executable only in an emulator program, and thus such an emulator program is needed as well.<br></p>
    <p>Of the software components mentioned above, the "preliminary" stage of the development tools includes:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The preprocessor</li>
      <li>The tokenizer+parser</li>
      <li>A code generator for the PALMAT intermediate language (discussed in <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#PALMAT">the Appendix</a>).</li>
      <li>An emulator for the PALMAT intermediate language.</li>
      <li>An <i>interpreter</i> loop (not mentioned among the minimal requirements earlier), which uses the items above for inputting and immediately executing lines of code not necessarily comprising an entire HAL/S program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have no firm schedule for completing "preliminary" development.&nbsp; The preliminary version is partially usable now (February 2023), with a restricted HAL/S feature set.&nbsp; I certainly hope it will be complete prior to the end of 2023.&nbsp; But it isn't required for the preliminary version to be 100% complete before commencing the "advanced" development.<br></p>
    <p>Of the preliminary components mentioned above, most but not all of them can be suitably retained in the "advanced" stage.&nbsp; The problem begins with the PALMAT intermediate language, because it does not employ an encoding conducive to efficient storage of the object files, and the problems continue with the PALMAT emulator, because in addition to the inefficiency of the PALMAT format itself, the emulator is written in Python and cannot be adequately improved in terms of execution speed.<br></p>
    <p>Therefore, once the preliminary stage of development is completed, the preprocessor, parser, and PALMAT code generator can continue to be used but the following advanced development, at minimum, needs to take place as well:<br></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>An efficient object language must be designed, perhaps just a better way of encoding PALMAT numerically rather than its current JSON representation.&nbsp; For the sake of discussion, I'll call this efficient represention "GALMAT", but in practice it may not have that name.&nbsp; For example, one <i>could</i> develop a PALMAT-to-C translator, and then GALMAT would simply be C.&nbsp; I argue neither for nor against that, but it would have some obvious advantages and some unobvious disadvantages.<br></li>
      <li>Software for translating PALMAT to GALMAT must be created.</li>
      <li>Optimization sofware for PALMAT and/or GALMAT object code must be created.</li>
      <li>A linker for GALMAT code must be created.</li>
      <li>An emulator for GALMAT files must be created, preferentially written in C for integration purposes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>No interactive interpreter loop is needed in the advanced stage.<br></p>
    <h1><a name="Preliminary"></a>Preliminary Version of the Compiler</h1>
    <p>By the way, it's helpful to understand Python (or JavaScript) datatypes somewhat, in order to understand the description that follows.&nbsp; At the very least, you should know the distinctions between "lists" vs "tuples" vs "sets" vs "dictionaries".
</p>
    <h2><a name="Code"></a>Code</h2>
    <h3>Folder Setup</h3>
    <p>All Virtual AGC software related to the Space Shuttle, both "modern" and from the original Shuttle project, appears in <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaShuttle">the yaShuttle folder of Virtual AGC's GitHub repository</a>.  At the present time, all such software is incomplete and/or under development, and it is <i>not</i> automatically built when building Virtual AGC from source.<br></p>
    <p>There are three main categories of material found in the afore-mentioned yaShuttle folder:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Original Shuttle-era software:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The subfolder called "yaShuttle/Source Code/HAL-S-FC-REL32V0/" contains partial source code of the original HAL/S compiler.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>HAL/S source-code samples from contemporary documentation:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The subfolder called "yaShuttle/Source Code/Programming in HAL-S/", contains numerous excerpts of sample code found the book <i>Programming in HAL/S</i> or adapted from it.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>"Modern" material in yaShuttle/ itself:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The file HAL_S.cf is a description of the HAL/S language in so-called Labeled Backus-Naur Form (LBNF).  It is the basis for the modern HAL/S compiler and differs somewhat from the original Shuttle-era BNF description of HAL/S.</li>
        <li>Most of the *.py and *.c files comprise the modern compiler, although a few *.py files represent some utilities instead.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The bulk of the modern code is written in Python 3, and thus can be run in any Python 3 installation without other preparation.  <br></p>
    <p>However, the tokenizer+parser is a program in the C language, and must be compiled for the target platform.  There are two approaches to this, depending on whether or not the LBNF description of HAL/S (i.e., the HAL_S.cf file mentioned above) has changed or not.  For the sake of discussion, let's call these <i>deep builds</i> (HAL_S.cf changed) vs <i>shallow builds</i> (HAL_S.cf unchanged).  I've not as of yet given much thought or put much effort into the most-convenient way to build this program on a target-platform by target-platform basis, so I'll just explain the way I currently do it.<br></p>
    <h3>Shallow Build</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, a "shallow build" is one in which the file HAL_S.cf has not changed.<br></p>
    <p>The current Makefile is written for my own setup, namely Linux Mint 21 with the usual C compiler (<tt>gcc</tt>) and a Windows cross-compiler (<tt>x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc</tt>) installed, though I expect it would work on may versions of Linux as-is.  Simply running the command <tt>make</tt> from the folder yaShuttle/ builds both the native Linux version of the tokenizer+compiler (namely <tt>modernHAL-S-FC</tt>) and a 64-bit Windows version of it (<tt>x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe</tt>).  I've not tried to build the Windows version of the program directly on Windows, but the one included in the yaShuttle/ folder already in the repository should work fine, so there's not much need to rebuild it directly on Windows.  It even works in Linux, under WINE, though I don't recommend doing so.<br></p>
    <p>The yaShuttle/ folder in the repository also has a pre-compiled Mac OS version of the tokenizer+Parser (<tt>modernHAL-S-FC-macosx</tt>), but since Mac OS programs cannot really be built from Linux, and since it's a great hassle for me to build it directly on Mac OS, the Mac version is unlikely to be fully up-to-date except when I make an effort to release it.  Thus if you have Mac OS, you're very likely to have to build it from source yourself.  Fortunately, it's easy.  Just clone the Virtual AGC GitHub repository onto your Mac; in a console, descend into the yaShuttle/ folder, and do <tt>make modernHAL-S-FC-macosx</tt>.<br></p>
    <p>If you have some platform other than Linux, Windows 64, or Mac OS, or are using some other C compiler than what I've anticipated, you should still be able to do a shallow build of the tokenizer+parser quite easily.  Just compile all of the files yaShuttle/*.c together.  The default name the modern HAL/S compiler expects this program to have is <tt>modernHAL-S-FC.exe</tt> on Windows, <tt>modernHAL-S-FC-macosx</tt> on Mac, or <tt>modernHAL-S-FC</tt> everywhere else, but you can override this command-line switch at when you invoke the modern HAL/S compiler.  The command-line switch needed is <tt>--compiler=</tt><tt><i>NameOfCompiler</i></tt>. <br></p>
    <h3>Deep Build</h3>
    <p>A "deep build" is one in which the file HAL_S.cf has been modified in some way <i>other</i> than what's available in our GitHub repository.  (In other words, if you don't like <i>my</i> LBNF description of HAL/S, and want to make your own tweaks to it.)  In this case, an extra processing step is needed to create the *.c and *.h files for a shallow build of the tokenizer+parser as described above.<br></p>
    <p>This extra processing step requires installation of the so-called <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/">BNF Converter (BNFC) framework</a>, which builds tokenizers and parsers from an LBNF description of a context-free language, such as our LBNF file HAL_S.cf, so ...<br></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>One-time setup</b>:  Install BNF Converter.<br></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But I must warn you, while BNF Converter purports to be platform-independent, it achieves that independence by using whatever standardized tokenizer builders and parser builders are popular on the platform on which it is running.  On Linux, for example, it uses the <i>flex</i> tokenizer library and the <i>bison</i> parser library.  On other platforms it uses other libraries.  Hence, I have no way in the world to guarantee the results when running BNFC on some platform other than Linux.  Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't.<br></p>
    <p>You should be able to perform a deep build using the following command:<br></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>make distclean all</tt><br></p>
    </blockquote>
    This operation creates a subfolder called yaShuttle/temp/, uses it
    as a working directory for building new *.c and *.h files for the
    tokenizer+parser, copies those files into yaShuttle/, and then
    performs the steps for a shallow build as described above.<br>
    <p>Again ... if this doesn't work for you, I have little advice other than "next time, try Linuxing."<br></p>
    <h3>Invocation of the Modern HAL/S Compiler<br>
    </h3>
    <p>At any rate, given that a native version of the tokenizer+parser is available, the modern compiler is invoked by the command<br></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>yaHAL-S-FC.py [OPTIONS] <i>HalSourceFiles</i><br></tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You can see what <tt>OPTIONS</tt> are available by instead using the command<br></p>
    <p>	<tt>yaHAL-S-FC.py --help</tt><br></p>
    <p>However, at this stage of development, rather than using the compiler <i>as</i> a compiler (i.e., to compile source files into executable object files), you'd be more-likely to want to run it interactively as an interpreter.  I would advise you to consult the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="hal-s-interpreter.html">HAL/S Interpreter page</a> dedicated to that particular usage.<br></p>

    <p>TBD<br></p>
    <h1><a name="Validation"></a>Validation and Regression Testing<br>
    </h1>
    <p>There is a HAL/S file in the source-code tree called "val.hal" which can be used for validation and regression testing of the HAL/S compiler and emulator.  <br></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, it is a program I wrote myself, rather than being one from the Shuttle development team, so how correct you think it is depends on how much confidence you have in me.  (Don't feel guilty if you haven't any.  Just help me out by writing your own HAL/S validation program or helping to fix mine!)  I'd venture tentatively to grade val.hal perhaps 7 out of 10, though I expect it to grow continually more complete and more accurate over the course of time, even if never 100% so.  I am told by one of the original Shuttle software developers that it is unlikely any contemporary test suite for the HAL/S compiler has survived, and that mini test suites kept by individual developers have likely disappeared as well; but fortunately, in my experience, opinions that such-and-such code <i>hasn't</i> survived haven't proven to be entirely reliable.  A lot more has probably survived, completely forgotten or else selfishly guarded from prying eyes, in the hidden recesses of government or private collections than you or I will ever know.<br></p>
    <p>Running the test is quite simple, since all it asks of you is to enter either 0 or 1, and then it runs without further assistance from you:  It computes various results, and then tests those results to see if they're what I expected them to be on the basis of my understanding of the HAL/S language requirements and other contemporary documentation.   Entering a 0 at the initial prompt disables certain "time-consuming" tests (requiring a total of about 57 seconds), whereas 1 enables them.  The possibility of disabling them is really more of a convenience for my own workflow — since I tend to run these tests a <i>lot</i> — than for any more generally satisfying reason, and you'll probably always want these tests enabled.<br></p>
    <p>Each individual test prints a designation for the test (such as "8.01A" or "MATRIX MULTIPLY") and then prints either "success" or "failure".  In the case of "failure", you can use the test designation to look at val.hal and see in more detail what was happening when the test failed; it could be that val.hal itself had a bug.  The total number of failures is printed at the end, so you usually don't even need to look at the individual results.<br></p>
    <p>In general, the individual tests are implementation-agnostic, and therefore should produce the same results in any implementation.  (If you've written your own HAL/S compiler and emulator, feel free to run val.hal on it.)  There are some exceptions, at the moment involving only tests in which the arithmetical precision (which is implementation-dependent) could differ, and messages are printed along with those results to point out this possibility.<br></p>
    <p>Also, at the very end of the test run, some tests are performed for informational purposes, such as for timing the execution speed, and such tests have no "correct" success/fail result.  They can be ignored or not, as desired.<br></p>
    <h1><a name="PALMAT"></a>Appendix: PALMAT Specification</h1>
    <h2><a name="Background"></a>Background</h2>
    <p>The "preliminary" version of the HAL/S compiler produces object files in the form of an intermediate language named "PALMAT".&nbsp; This name derives from the fact that the original Shuttle era compiler, HAL/S-FC, produced an intermediate language known as "HALMAT"; but I'm not sure why HALMAT was given that name.&nbsp; HALMAT was machine-independent.&nbsp; The original compiler then optimized the HALMAT intermediate code, and translated it to whatever machine-dependent form was needed for the target computer.&nbsp; In the case of IBM System/360 (mainframe) or IBM AP-101S (Shuttle GPC) target systems, the target language was some variant of IBM's Basic Assembly Language (BAL).<br></p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, I would have simply had the modern compiler produce HALMAT instead of inventing my own intermediate language for that purpose, except that there was insufficient available surviving documentation of HALMAT to accomplish that.&nbsp; Essentially the only useful available documentation about HALMAT was in Appendix A of the document "HAL/S-360 Compiler System Specification", but the only copy we have of that is partial, and is missing perhaps 80% of Appendix A.&nbsp; I have ongoing FOIA requests in place for additional documentation, and it remains to be seen if my requested documents can be found or not; but regardless, I have chosen not to wait to find out, and that has turned out to be the correct decision.<br></p>
    <p>Thus ... PALMAT!<br></p>
    <p>The PALMAT language has a minimal instruction set intended to have behaviors that are very easy to implement in an emulator.&nbsp; Since the preliminary code compiler code generator and the preliminary emulator are written in Python, the format of a PALMAT dataset makes heavy usage of Python datatypes such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, and sets; moreover, PALMAT object files are basically just JSON representations of the Python internal dataset, and are thus both very human-friendly and very easily output from and input into Python programs.&nbsp; But use of Python-style datatypes and JSON storage formats is <i>not</i> conducive to rapid emulation.<br></p>
    <p>PALMAT is thus described in detail here in the hope of aiding translation from PALMAT to a more-efficient representation for both storage and emulation.<br></p>
    <h2><a name="ImplementationDependent"></a>Implementation-Dependent
      Details</h2>
    <p>The general HAL/S documentation leaves a number of details of the language specification as "implementation dependent", and in a spectacular display of nonsensical behavior, the Shuttle-specific documentation for HAL/S written near the end of the Shuttle program continues to do so!  Obviously I want the PALMAT-based implementation to match the behavior of the actual compiler used for the Shuttle flight software, but alas I am forced to invent my own implementation-dependence which may not match that of the original Shuttle software.  Perhaps when the actual Shuttle flight-software source code can be examined, the original implementation details can be deduced and this section will be updated.  <br></p>
    <p>Other than the unknown limits imposed by available memory (which are unlikely to be of any significance for Shuttle flight software), the following limits currently exist in the PALMAT implementation:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>INTEGER</tt> and <tt>INTEGER DOUBLE</tt> precision:  Identical and unlimited.  (Recall that in Python, unlimited-precision integer arithmetic is used internally, albeit with increasingly-large use of resources for large integers.)</li>
      <li><tt>SCALAR</tt> and <tt>SCALAR DOUBLE</tt> precision:  Identical, and match the precision of the <tt>float</tt> datatype for the Python version used to implement the PALMAT emulator.  For a 64-bit machine, I expect that's on the order of 16 decimal digits, plus sign and exponent.<br></li>
      <li>Maximum bit-string width:  Bit-string literals like <tt>BIN'101001'</tt> (or <tt>HEX'...'</tt>, <tt>DEC'...'</tt>, or <tt>OCT'...'</tt>) are supposed to pad shorter bit-strings to the implementation maximum, and for that purpose only, a maximum of 256 (<tt>MAXBITSTRING</tt>) bits per bit-string is used.  But aside from this arbitrary choice, there are no limits applied to bit-string width.  <b>Note:</b>  A bit-string is implemented as a Python integer supplemented by an attribute specifying the maximum size of the integer (which may differ for different bit-string values).  Thus bit-string operations essentially inherit the unlimited precision of integer operations.</li>
      <li>Maximum character-string width:  No limits.<br></li>
      <li>Maximum number of <tt>ARRAY</tt> dimensions:  No limits.</li>
      <li>Maximum width of an <tt>ARRAY</tt> dimension:  1,000,000,000 (<tt>MAXDIMWIDTH</tt>).</li>
      <li>Format of (<tt>SCALAR</tt>) RTL <tt>CLOCKTIME</tt> function:  Number of seconds since midnight UTC.  The returned value superficially has a precision to the microsecond, but there is no guarantee that it is accurate.</li>
      <li>Format of (<tt>INTEGER</tt>) RTL <tt>DATE</tt> function:  The UTC date at the preceding midnight, expressed in 8 decimal digits as YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is 01 through 12, and DD is 01 through 31.</li>
      <li>Format of (<tt>SCALAR</tt>) RTL <tt>RUNTIME</tt> function:  The time, in seconds, since the current instance of the PALMAT emulator began execution.  Superficially precise to the microsecond, but with no guarantee of accuracy.  If multiple HAL/S programs are running simultaneously, each emulator instance may have a different start time and therefore return a different <tt>RUNTIME</tt>, even if the programs are intercommunicating.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Datatypes"></a>Representation of HAL/S Data Types</h2>
    <p>In PALMAT, the various HAL/S data types are represented as follows:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>An individual <tt>INTEGER</tt> is represented as a Python integer.</li>
      <li>An individual <tt>SCALAR</tt> is represented as a Python float.</li>
      <li>HAL/S double-quoted strings, as appearing in <tt>REPLACE</tt> statements, are handled entirely by the compiler's preprocessor and do not appear at all in PALMAT.</li>
      <li>HAL/S single-quoted strings (<tt>CHARACTER</tt> datatype) are represented as Python strings.</li>
      <li>A HAL/S bit-string (<tt>BIT</tt> or <tt>BOOLEAN</tt> datatype) is represented as a Python list of three elements, thusly: <tt>[<i>value</i>, <i>length</i>, "b"]</tt>. Here, <i><tt>value</tt></i> is an integer representation of the bit string, with each bit position representing one of the bits of the bit-string, and the <i><tt>length</tt></i> is the maximum number of bits in the bit-string.&nbsp; The "first" bit in the string is the most-significant bit of the value, and the "last" bit of the string is the least-significant bit of the value.&nbsp; The case of <i><tt>length</tt></i>=1 corresponds to the HAL/S <tt>BOOLEAN</tt> datatype.<br></li>
      <li><tt>VECTOR</tt> is represented as a Python list of floats, though integers are tolerated as well.</li>
      <li><tt>MATRIX</tt> is represented as a Python list of lists of floats, with integers tolerated.&nbsp; The outer list represents the rows, and the inner lists represents the column-positions within the rows.&nbsp; All of the inner lists have the same length.</li>
      <li>A <tt>STRUCTURE</tt> is represented as a Python dictionary, in the obvious way.&nbsp; Note that this way of representing a structure loses certain information significant in HAL/S, specifically the defined ordering of the various fields of the structure.&nbsp; The ordering is important in HAL/S because <tt>INITIAL</tt> and <tt>CONSTANT</tt> clauses in <tt>DECLARE</tt> statements rely on knowledge of it.&nbsp; Therefore, information is maintained about this ordering, but it is separate in the identifier attributes of the identifier dictionary (see <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Identifiers">Identifiers</a>) rather than a part of the Python dictionary associated with the structure.</li>
      <li><tt>ARRAY</tt> is represented similarly to <tt>MATRIX</tt> as a hierarchy of lists, <i>except</i> that the dimensionality can be anything (rather than always 2D) <i>and</i> that every list at each level of the hierarchy has final entry of <tt>'a'</tt>.&nbsp; Each level of lists in this hierarchy has lists all of the same length.&nbsp; Elements of the final level of lists can be any of the datatypes described above, but all are of the <i>same</i> datatype.&nbsp; Explicit examples appear at the end of this section.</li>
      <li>A "pointer" to a variable is represented by the Python list <tt>[<i>index</i>, <i>identifier</i>, 'p']</tt>, where <i><tt>identifier</tt></i> is the name (a string) of the variable and <i><tt>index</tt></i> is for the scope in which the identifier's declaration appears.&nbsp; Note that pointers to variables do not appear (so far) except for the specific use of specifying target variables for a HAL/S <tt>READ</tt> statement.<br></li>
      <li>An uninitialized individual data value of any simple type (i.e., not <tt>VECTOR</tt>, <tt>MATRIX</tt>, <tt>ARRAY</tt>, or <tt>STRUCTURE</tt>) is represented by a Python <tt>None</tt>.&nbsp; Uninitialized elements of a composite type like <tt>VECTOR</tt> are represented by <tt>None</tt>, but the composite as a whole retains its structure (as a list, list of lists, structure, etc.).</li>
      <li>Additionally, though not representing any specific HAL/S data types, the Python set datatype is used in place of data under some circumstances (see <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#ComputationStack">Computation Stack</a> below).&nbsp; The Python set <tt>{ "sentinel" }</tt> is the principal example of this, and it is used to terminate variable-length sequences of data values, without itself being confusable with any existing HAL/S datatype.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are a few examples of the representation of the <tt>ARRAY</tt> vs <tt>VECTOR</tt> and <tt>MATRIX</tt> types of comparable geometries.<br></p>

    <h2><a name="ComputationStack"></a>The Computation Stack</h2>
    <p>To understand some of the descriptions below, particularly in the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Instructions">Instructions Section</a>, it's helpful to have some idea of the computational model PALMAT envisages.<br></p>
    <p>Specifically, whenever PALMAT instructions are engaged in any activities that require computation of a value, it employs a construct that I call the "computation stack".&nbsp; The computation stack is simply a last-in first-out buffer, onto which the PALMAT instructions (discussed later) can do things like push numerical values, pop numerical values to perform mathematical operations on them, and so forth.&nbsp; By combining various primitive operations of this kind, the values of expressions of any complexity can be computed, including some operations (like the HAL/S repetition operator, <tt>#</tt>) that have no analogs in programming languages which tend to be more familiar.&nbsp; I'll refer to the computation stack quite often later, and may simply call it "the stack".  There's no confusion in doing so, since there is no general-purpose stack in the HAL/S computation model, and in particular, return addresses for subroutines are not stored on a stack.<br></p>
    <p>Elements of any of the types described in the preceding section can appear on the computation stack, but not objects of any other kind.<br></p>
    <p>However, the computation stack does not form any part of the PALMAT structure we're discussing, and I mention it merely as background information; it's an an entirely separate object within the emulator from the PALMAT structure.<br></p>
    <h2><a name="Scopes"></a>Scopes</h2>
    At any rate, at the topmost level, a PALMAT structure is little more
    than a list of "scopes":<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>PALMAT = { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "scopes" : [ SCOPE0, SCOPE1, SCOPE2, ... ], <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "instantiation" : <i>N</i> , <br>    "sourceFiles" : []<br>}</tt><br></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b> There <i>can</i> be fields other than <tt>"scopes"</tt> in the PALMAT structure.  While this section focuses just on scopes, let me at least give you a brief rundown on the extra fields you do see in the sample above.<br></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">The <tt>"instantiation"</tt> is a unique integer value for each PALMAT structure created, starting at 0.  Multiple PALMAT structures are created in case there are multiple PALMAT emulation threads or processes running simultaneously.  You could think of the <tt>instantiation</tt> much like a process-identification number.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">The <tt>"sourceFiles"</tt> entry is a list of the HAL/S source-code files used during compilation.  When PALMAT instructions are generated, as is described later on, individual instructions can be tagged with the source-code file they're derived from, the line number within the source file, and a column number within the line.  Instead of attaching the full filename string to each instruction, an integer is instead used to represent the filename, and that integer is the index of the filename in the <tt>sourceFiles</tt> list.</font><br></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What these scopes signify, and the reason they are called "scopes", is that they let us determine which identifiers (variables, constants, program labels) are accessible from any given point in the code.&nbsp; As you'll see in a moment, the scopes are actually in a hierarchical arrangement that's more complex than the simple list structure shown above, and a given scope (with some exceptions) can generally access identifiers defined in itself or in its ancestors in the hierarchy, but not in its descendants or "cousins", "uncles", "nephews", etc.<br></p>
    <p>Scope 0 is the top-level scope, of which all other scopes are descendants, and essentially represents what you might call "global" elements.&nbsp; Each scope comprises the dictionary of the identifiers (variables, program labels) defined in it, along with their properties, and the list of PALMAT instructions defined in the scope, plus (potentially) other items.&nbsp; <i>Pure</i> HAL/S actually has no global variables or statements that can be compiled to instructions, but it does have other top-level compilation objects, each of which has an associated identifier, such as <br></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>PROGRAM</tt></li>
      <li><tt>FUNCTION</tt></li>
      <li><tt>PROCEDURE</tt></li>
      <li><tt>COMPOOL</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p>(In HAL/S, a <tt>COMPOOL</tt> is a set of variables which can be shared among programs, functions, or procedures which normally could not do so, perhaps due to being in separate source-code files.  This is like a FORTRAN COMMON area.&nbsp; A <tt>COMPOOL</tt> is the closest thing in HAL/S to a set of global variables.) Thus in pure HAL/S, Scope 0 would be basically be just a collection of child scopes, one for each of the programs, functions, procedures, or compools defined in it.<br></p>
    <p>However, for several reasons, such as our desire to have a HAL/S interpreter, our own implementation is "impure" in the sense that we actually <i>do</i> allow the global scope to have global variables as well as active code not wrapped in any program, function, procedure, or compool.&nbsp; These "impure" possibilities are transparent to existing Shuttle software written in "pure" HAL/S.<br></p>
    <p>To illustrate with an example, consider the HAL/S source code, <br></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>DECLARE I INTEGER INITIAL(5);</tt><tt><br></tt><tt>WRITE(6) I;</tt><br></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>which simply prints out the value 5.&nbsp; This code is impure since it exists outside of any containing <tt>PROGRAM</tt>.&nbsp; Upon compilation we get a PALMAT structure that looks like this:<br></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>PALMAT = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "scopes": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "parent": None, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "self": 0, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "children": [], <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "identifiers": {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "^I^": {"integer": true, "initial": 5, "value": 5}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "instructions": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {"fetch": [0, "I"]}, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {"write": "6"}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ], <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "type": "root"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ], <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "instantiation": 0<br>}<br></tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This structure contains everything needed to run the sample code just mentioned.</p>
    <p>There's only a single scope here, and everything occurs within this scope, but most of the basic parts are present that would appear in any scope. So what are the properties of that scope?<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>parent, self, children</tt>:&nbsp; The scopes are in a strict hierarchical arrangement, in which each scope has a parent (unless it is the global scope, 0), itself, and a list of 0 or more children.&nbsp; Each of these is identified by a corresponding numerical index within the <tt>P</tt><tt>ALMAT["scopes"]</tt> array.&nbsp; Since we have only scope 0 in our example, it has no parent, and thus its <tt>parent</tt> is listed as <tt>None</tt>, which is an object used in Python that we use here to mean that there is no assigned value.&nbsp; Moreover, it has no children.&nbsp; But it will always have itself, which it identifies as <tt>SELF 0</tt>.<br></li>
      <li><tt>identifiers</tt>:&nbsp; This is a Python dictionary of all of the identifiers (variables, constants, program labels) defined in the scope.&nbsp; In this case, there's only one variable, <tt>I</tt>.&nbsp; It has various attributes, in this case "integer", "initial", and "value", which I'll discuss later.</li>
      <li><tt>instructions</tt>:&nbsp; This a Python list of all of the PALMAT instructions for the scope, in the order in which they're executed.&nbsp; The available PALMAT instructions and their behaviors will be discussed in a later section.&nbsp; In this particular example, the first instruction <tt>{"fetch": [0, "I"]}</tt> gets the value of the variable I from scope 0, and the second instruction, <tt>{"write": "6"}</tt>, prints it out.<br></li>
      <li><tt>type</tt>:&nbsp; This is an indication of what type of compilation unit the scope is associated with.&nbsp; I'll get to those in a moment.&nbsp; The <tt>type</tt> is useful because there are cases in which a given scope has access to identifiers defined in their ancestor scopes, but only to a certain point; the <tt>type</tt> allows those demarcation points to be known in searches for identifiers within the scope hierarchy.&nbsp; (Such searches are very rare in emulation of PALMAT object code, since most can be resolved at compile-time; however, emulation-time searches associated with <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clauses in <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> calls may still be needed, until/unless I see how to eliminate them.)<br></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As I began by saying, this example is "impure" HAL/S.&nbsp; But we can convert it to a "pure" HAL/S example if we provide a <tt>PROGRAM</tt> wrapper:</p>
    <blockquote><tt>EXAMPLE: PROGRAM;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DECLARE I INTEGER INITIAL(5);</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt> </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(6) I;<br>
        CLOSE EXAMPLE;<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    Having done that, the compiled PALMAT representation becomes
    instead:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>{<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "scopes": [<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>

        }</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Thus we now have two scopes rather than just the one.&nbsp; Scope 0
    is now largely empty, just as we should have expected, except that
    it defines a single identifier, namely <tt>EXAMPLE</tt>, the
    newly-defined <tt>PROGRAM</tt>.&nbsp; Similarly, scope 1 now
    contains everything that our earlier scope 0 used to, with a few
    relatively-minor changes.&nbsp; One such change is that it now has <tt>type










      "program"</tt>, which is presumably self explanatory, as well as
    fields <tt>"name"</tt> and <tt>"attributes"</tt> that simply
    duplicate the declaration in scope 0.&nbsp; <br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; If we were to run
        this code, starting from instruction 0 in scope 0, it would
        actually do nothing at all, for there are no instructions listed
        in scope 0.&nbsp; That's perfect HAL/S behavior, since HAL/S
        imagines the existence of a "monitor" program as part of the
        operating system, and it is the monitor which initiates and
        supervises execution of a list of HAL/S <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s it is
        given, on a timesharing basis. </font><br>
    </blockquote>
    However, top-level compilation units like <tt>PROGRAM</tt>, <tt>FUNCTION</tt>,
    <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>, and <tt>COMPOOL</tt> are not the only things
    that are segregated into their own dedicated scopes by the
    compiler's code generator.&nbsp; Any HAL/S <tt>DO</tt> block or <tt>IF</tt>
    statement will trigger creation of a new child scope dedicated to it
    as well, and mark the new scope with the associated <tt>type</tt>.&nbsp;










    Here are the values of <tt>type</tt> that have been used up to now:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>"root"<br></li>
      <li>"program"</li>
      <li>"function"</li>
      <li>"procedure"</li>
      <li>"compool"</li>
      <li>"do"</li>

      <li>"do until"</li>
      <li>"if"<br></li>
      <li>"unknown"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As one final example, consider the HAL/S code, which contains several of the block types just mentioned:<br></p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>This produces a PALMAT structure like the one below.&nbsp; Since my purpose here in this section is just to illustrate how scopes interact, I won't dissect it in detail for you (exercise for the reader!), except to say that the various identifiers you see whose names are of the form <tt>xx_X</tt>, where <tt>xx</tt> is a pair of lower-case letters and <tt>X</tt> is a number, are program labels automatically created by the compiler's code generator.&nbsp; They are used both by PALMAT instructions like "<tt>goto</tt>" (discussed later) that cause some kind of jump to a different address, and by the PALMAT instructions that are the targets of such jumps.&nbsp; Thus, for example, you'll see an instruction <tt>{"goto": [0, "^ue_1^"]}</tt> in scope 0 and a matching instruction <tt>{"noop": true, "label": "^ue_1^"}</tt> in scope 1.&nbsp; The former is a jump to the latter.&nbsp; When this code is executed, beginning at instruction 0 in scope 0, the first thing that happens is a jump to instruction 0 in scope 1, which represents the <tt>DO WHILE</tt> block.&nbsp; Several instructions in the <tt>DO WHILE</tt> block are executed, until near the end of the block we see the instruction <tt>{"goto": [1, "^ue_2^"]}</tt>, which is a jump to scope 2, the <tt>IF</tt> block.&nbsp; Eventually, after scope 2 does its work it returns to scope 1 (via the instruction <tt>{"goto": [1, "^ur_2^"]}</tt>), and scope 1 eventually returns to scope 0 (via <tt>{"goto": [0, "^ur_1^"]}</tt>), at which point scope 0 runs out of instructions to execute, and emulation halts.<br></p>

    <p>This particular example happens to illustrate an interesting point about some program-label identifiers, namely that they may be <i>defined</i> in one scope but actually represent a location in a descendant scope.&nbsp; This is the case with the program labels <tt>ue_1</tt> and <tt>ue_2</tt>.&nbsp; Recall that I mentioned earlier that scopes have access to identifiers declared in their ancestor scopes, but ancestors have no access to identifiers defined in their descendant scopes.&nbsp; That's what's happening here.&nbsp; Both scopes 0 and 1 need the definition of <tt>ue_1</tt> to be accessible to them, and scope 1 has access to scope 0's definitions, but not vice-versa.&nbsp; This forces the code generator to define <tt>ue_1</tt> in scope 0, even though the label itself really refers to an address in scope 1.<br></p>
    <p>As you can probably imagine by now, any practical example of HAL/S code will compile to quite a large hierarchy of scopes, descending to many levels deep and quite wide in terms of the numbers of sibling scopes.&nbsp; Part of the job of a linker program would be arrange all of these scopes linearly in memory in a reasonably efficient way to eliminate useless jumps; whereas when emulating PALMAT directly, each scope can continue to exist in its own memory space that is essentially independent of all the others, rather than being in any particular linear memory order with respect to them.<br></p>
    <h2><a name="Data"></a>Data Model</h2>
    <p>By the "data model" for a scope, I mean the "identifiers" dictionary in the scope, which was illustrated a little bit in the preceding section.&nbsp; The <tt>identifiers</tt> dictionary has an entry — i.e., a key/value pair — for each identifier accessible to the scope and its descendant scopes, but not to other scopes.&nbsp; Very often these identifiers will be the names of variables or constants for which actual space within the scope is allocated.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the identifiers will be symbolic program labels, either for named entities (like a <tt>PROGRAM</tt>, <tt>FUNCTION</tt>, or <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>) or for positions in the PALMAT instruction stream not explicitly named by the HAL/S source code but for which a label has been transparently created by the compiler's code generator.&nbsp; Often, as mentioned above, these locations will not be in the scope where their symbolic labels are defined in the identifiers dictionary, but rather in some descendant scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in HAL/S code such as the following,<br></p>
    <blockquote><tt>F: FUNCTION(X);<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G: FUNCTION(Y);<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLOSE G;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z = G(X);<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
        CLOSE F;</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    function <tt>G</tt> (and hence the program label "<tt>G</tt>") will
    always be in a child scope of the scope of function <tt>F</tt>, and
    yet the identifier <tt>G</tt> itself will always be defined in the
    <tt>F</tt>'s scope.<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Let me detour for a moment to cover technical issues you may have noticed concerning the names of identifiers.&nbsp; There are two of these issues to be aware of:<br></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">In the identifier dictionary, you'll always find identifiers decorated by what I refer to as "carat quotes".&nbsp; For example, for a declaration like <tt>DECLARE I INTEGER</tt>, you'd find that <tt>^I^</tt> appeared as a key in the identifier dictionary rather than merely <tt>I</tt>. <br></font></li>
        <li><font size="-1"><i>Some</i> types of identifiers appear in "mangled" forms related to their datatypes.&nbsp; This mangling, discussed later in the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Preprocessor">Preprocessor Section</a>, takes the form of a suffix of either 1 or 2 lower-case letters and an underline.&nbsp; Thus in the examples you saw earlier, the <tt>PROGRAM EXAMPLE</tt> turned into the identifier "<tt>^l_EXAMPLE^</tt>".</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="-1">Or to be blunt, </font><font size="-1"><tt>^l_EXAMPLE^</tt></font><font size="-1"> is nothing more nor less than </font><font size="-1"><tt>EXAMPLE</tt></font><font size="-1">, and you can basically ignore the decorations.  Both of these modifications to the identifier names are inherited from details of the inner workings of the preprocessor and parser; I won't go into detail with that here, except to say that there is no good reason for either of these modifications to persist once PALMAT has been generated and is going to be emulated.&nbsp; Both types of modifications can simply be stripped away in "advanced" stage development.&nbsp; (Though I've seen no actual Shuttle HAL/S source code as of yet, my belief is that it is all upper case, while the carat (^) is not a legal character in HAL/S.&nbsp; So there should be no identifiers in the Shuttle flight software that mimic these modifications.  If it turns out that there are, I guess I'll have to modify the name-mangling scheme somewhat.)</font><br></p>
    </blockquote>
    The value associated with an identifier key, i.e. <tt>PALMAT["scopes"][index]["identifiers"][identifier]</tt>,
    is itself a dictionary of key/value pairs describing the
    identifier's attributes.&nbsp; At the time I'm writing this, I don't
    necessarily know all of the possible attributes an identifier may
    have, but here are the ones I do know about:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>For variables:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>One (and only one) of the following keys:&nbsp; "scalar", "integer", "bit", "character", "vector", "matrix", or "structure".&nbsp; As for the values associated with these keys:<br></li>
        <ul>
          <li>"scalar" or "integer":&nbsp; The value is always the boolean <tt>True</tt>.  (I mean the value associated with the key/value pair in the dictionary; not the value of the variable; that's covered in a moment.)</li>
          <li>"bit", "character", or "vector":&nbsp; The value is an integer, giving the width of the bit-string, character-string, or vector stored in the variable.</li>
          <li>"matrix": The value is a list of two integers defining the geometry, thusly:&nbsp; [number of rows, number of columns].</li>
          <li>"structure": TBD</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Optional "array".&nbsp; The associated value is a list of the array's dimensions:&nbsp; [N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, ..., N<sub>M</sub>] for an M-dimensional array.</li>
        <li>Optional "initial".&nbsp; This is the initial value assigned to the variable, prior to execution of any code in the scope.&nbsp; See the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Datatypes">Datatypes Section</a> for an explanation of the nature of this data.<br></li>
        <li>Optional "value".&nbsp; This is the value assigned to the variable.&nbsp; I've noted here that it's "optional", because it may be omitted from the variable's attributes prior to any assignment occurring.&nbsp; But regarding uninitialized values, see also the comments about <tt>None</tt> in the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Datatypes">Datatypes Section</a>.</li>
        <li>Optional "static".&nbsp; Always <tt>True</tt> if present.&nbsp; It means that the initialization of a variable specified by the "initial" attribute (see above) is performed just once, at startup, and is not performed again if the defining block (<tt>FUNCTION</tt>, <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>, etc.) is executed again later.&nbsp; This is the default.<br></li>
        <li>Optional "automatic".&nbsp; Always <tt>True</tt> if present.&nbsp; It means that the initialization of a variable specified by the "initial" attribute (see above) is performed anew every time the declaring block is executed.</li>
        <li>Optional "aligned".&nbsp; Always <tt>True</tt> if present. It means that data is aligned on "appropriate" storage boundaries.&nbsp; The concept of "appropriateness" isn't defined in the documentation, but apparently means appropriate for fastest execution.&nbsp; This is not applicable to the PALMAT implementation in Python, and is thus ignored in the "preliminary" PALMAT-based implementation.<br></li>
        <li>Optional "dense".&nbsp; Always <tt>True</tt> if present. It means that data is aligned to require the least amount of memory, potentially at the cost of reduced execution speed.&nbsp; Essentially, it is the opposite of "aligned".&nbsp; And like "aligned", it is ignored in the Python PALMAT-based "preliminary" implementation.</li>
        <li>Optional "access".&nbsp; Always <tt>True</tt> if present.&nbsp; This refers to a managerial control apparently used in the original Shuttle development, namely that blocks of code can be granted specific access rights to variables that define what code has permissions to do what to that variable.&nbsp; In other words, some programmers were trusted to use certain variables in certain ways, and others were not.&nbsp; However ... this managerial concept may have been useful <i>prior</i> to code creation, but has no relevance at all after the code has been written and released, because any source code surviving to that point is guaranteed to obey the imposed access controls even if the access mechanism is no longer actively in place.&nbsp; Hence, the modern implementation (at least in the "preliminary" version) simply ignores this attribute.<br></li>
        <li>Optional "lock".&nbsp; If present, it has an integer value that refers to the "lock group" to which it pertains.&nbsp; This refers to temporary locks placed on variables shared in <tt>COMPOOL</tt>s by multiple simultaneous HAL/S processes.<br></li>
        <li>Optional "remote".&nbsp; If present, it has the value <tt>True</tt>.&nbsp; This attribute means that the variable may be seldom-used, and hence may reside in some form of auxiliary memory that's slow to access, rather than in quickly-accessed local memory.&nbsp; This concept of memory maintenance has no relevance to the modern implementation in which essentially unlimited amounts of fast memory are available, and hence is ignored.</li>
        <li>Optional "rigid".&nbsp; If present, it has the value <tt>True</tt>.&nbsp; It implies that the compiler is not allowed to reorder <tt>STRUCTURE</tt> fields, but instead requires them to remain in the same order in memory as implied by their HAL/S declarations.&nbsp; I'm not certain yet whether this concept is irrelevant to the modern implementation or not; but for the present it is being ignored.&nbsp; But see the "ordering" key immediately below.</li>
        <li>Optional "ordering".&nbsp; This field is present only for certain <tt>STRUCTURE</tt>s.  It has a bookkeeping purpose for the modern compiler, and is not related to anything in the original HAL/S language or compiler.  (But see "rigid" above.)&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Datatypes">Recall</a> that HAL/S <tt>STRUCTURE</tt>s are implemented in PALMAT as Python dictionaries, and that Python dictionaries do not have any concept of the ordering of the keys therein.&nbsp; On the other hand, recall also <tt>INITIAL</tt> and <tt>CONSTANT</tt> clauses in HAL/S <tt>DEFINE</tt> statements rely on a known ordering of the elements of composite datatypes (like <tt>STRUCTURE</tt>s).&nbsp; That being the case, if <tt>INITIAL</tt> or <tt>CONSTANT</tt> is present, or <tt>RIGID</tt> (see immediately above), knowledge of the expected ordering of <tt>STRUCTURE</tt> fields must be preserved.&nbsp; The "ordering" field provides that knowledge.&nbsp; The value associated with the "ordering" key is TBD.</li>
        <li>Optional "parameter".  This field is present (with the value <tt>True</tt>) for any identifier which is a formal <tt>FUNCTION</tt> or <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> parameter in its scope.<br></li>
      </ul>
      <li>For constants, the attributes are generally similar to variables as just described.&nbsp; But here are a few differences:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The "constant" key/value pair stores the value of the constant. <br></li>
        <li>"value" and "initial" aren't allowed.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For <tt>PROGRAM</tt> names:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"program" is always <tt>True</tt>.</li>
        <li>"scope" is the index within <tt>PALMAT["scopes"]</tt> of the scope dedicated to the program.&nbsp; (The entry address of the scope's code is always 0, and is therefore not specified.)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For <tt>FUNCTION</tt> names:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"function" is always <tt>True</tt>.</li>
        <li>"parameters" is a Python list, possibly empty, of the formal names of the function's parameters.&nbsp; These are mangled names (i.e., sometimes with prefixes like <tt>xx_</tt> indicating the datatype) but without so-called carat-quotes.</li>
        <li>"scope" is the index within <tt>PALMAT["scopes"]</tt> of the scope dedicated to the function.&nbsp; (The entry address of the scope's code is always 0, and is therefore not specified.)</li>
        <li>One and only one of the datatype fields described above for variables, i.e., "scalar", "integer", "bit", etc.&nbsp; These describe the return value of the function.&nbsp; Other of the attributes described for variables may be used as well, such as "array".</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> names:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"procedure" is always <tt>True</tt>.</li>
        <li>"parameters" is a Python list, possibly empty, of the formal names of the procedure's parameters.&nbsp; These are mangled names (i.e., sometimes with prefixes like <tt>xx_</tt> indicating the datatype) but without so-called carat-quotes.</li>
        <li>"assignments" is a Python list, possibly empty, of the formal names of parameters in the <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clause. These are mangled names (i.e., sometimes with prefixes like <tt>xx_</tt> indicating the datatype) but without so-called carat-quotes.</li>
        <li>"scope" is the index within <tt>PALMAT["scopes"]</tt> of the scope dedicated to the procedure.&nbsp; (The entry address of the scope's code is always 0, and is therefore not specified.)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For <tt>COMPOOL</tt> names:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"compool" is always <tt>True</tt>.</li>
        <li>"scope" is the index within <tt>PALMAT["scopes"]</tt> of the scope dedicated to the compool.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For program labels, i.e., symbolic labels for positions within PALMAT instruction streams, other than the <tt>PROGRAM</tt>, <tt>FUNCTION</tt>, and <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> entry points mentioned above.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"label" has a Python list value of the form [scope index, offset within the instructions of the scope].</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Other ... TBD<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Instructions"></a>Instructions</h2>
    <p>This section covers all available PALMAT instructions which can appear in an instruction stream, i.e., in <tt>PALMAT["scopes"][index]["instructions"]</tt>.&nbsp; I've grouped them below according to my categorization of their functionality.<br></p>
    <p>PALMAT instructions in the preliminary compiler implementation are always Python dictionaries.  Aside from the explicit specifications for those dictionaries described below, any instruction may have the following additional fields:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"<tt>label</tt>":  This is a unique symbolic label for the instruction to which it is attached.  It is used for making that instruction the target for instructions that change the instruction flow ... i.e., it allows some other instruction to "jump" to the labeled instruction without necessarily knowing the numerical address at compile-time.  This is described in more detail in the "<tt>goto</tt>" instruction below.</li>
      <li>"<tt>source</tt>":  This associates the instruction with a specific position within the HAL/S source-code file(s).  In the preliminary implementation, the value is a Python list with three integer entries:</li>
      <ol start="0" type="1">
        <li>The index (starting at 0) of the source-code filename in the <tt>PALMAT["sourceFiles"]</tt> list.  Or else -1 if unknown.</li>
        <li>The line number (starting at 1) within the source-code file, or -1 if unknown.</li>
        <li>The column number (starting at 1) within the source line, or else -1 if unknown.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>  In general, any given HAL/S source-code line will result in generation of multiple PALMAT instructions.  It's therefore a waste to attach "</font><font size="-1"><tt>source</tt></font><font size="-1">" fields to every instruction.  The rule-of-thumb is that if any PALMAT instruction lacks a </font><font size="-1"><tt>source</tt></font><font size="-1"> field, then its </font><font size="-1"><tt>source</tt></font><font size="-1"> is presumed to be identical to that of the preceding PALMAT instruction. <br></font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">There is one exception to this rule, namely instructions with "</font><font size="-1"><tt>label</tt></font><font size="-1">" fields.  In that case, the instruction may be jumped to directly, and it's more difficult for the emulator to know what the associated source line is without the extra work of analyzing backward through the instruction <i>addresses</i> rather than the instruction flow actually executed (which the emulator already knows and thus requires no additional work).  To assist the emulator, </font><font size="-1"><tt>source</tt></font><font size="-1"> fields may therefore be attached to instructions with </font><font size="-1"><tt>label</tt></font><font size="-1"> fields, even if the actual value of the </font><font size="-1"><tt>source</tt></font><font size="-1"> may be the same as that of the preceding instruction address.<br></font></p>

    <p>Recall the discussion of the so-called <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#ComputationStack">Computation Stack</a> from earlier.&nbsp; The instructions described in this section are primarily for the purpose of performing computations on the stack.  Below, if there is a single operand on the computation stack, I'll simply refer to it as "operand".&nbsp; If there are two operands on the stack, I'll refer to the one at the top of the stack (i.e., the first to be popped) as "operand1" and the next-to-top as "operand2".<br></p>
    <p>In general, if the operands in one of the operations described below are Python integers, and if the result can continue to be represented exactly as an integer, then the result will continue to be a Python integer.&nbsp; More usually, however, numerical-operation results will be Python floating-point values.<br></p>
    <p>Note also that several <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#ControlTransfer">control-transfer instructions</a> and <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Miscellaneous">miscellaneous instructions</a> also affect the computation stack in a generally-trivial way without that being their principal function, but are included in later sections rather than in the  table below.<br></p>

          <td valign="top">Pushes a literal number (HAL/S <tt>INTEGER</tt>
            or <tt>SCALAR</tt> onto the computation stack.&nbsp; In
            this "preliminary" Python implementation, the number
            embedded within the instruction is given in string form, and
            hence must be converted by the emulator at runtime into a
            Python integer or float before pushing it onto the
            stack.&nbsp; (In an instruction corresponding to this in an
            "advanced" implementation, the literal constant could
            presumably already be in the required native arithmetical
            format, thus needing no additional conversion.)&nbsp; That's
            because the compiler's code generator retains exponential
            modifiers like <tt>B5</tt> (power of 2) and <tt>H-2</tt>
            (power of 16) as-is, accepting the loss of runtime
            efficiency.&nbsp; That was an explicit design choice in the
            design of PALMAT, if perhaps its wisdom is somewhat
            questionable.&nbsp; Of course, Python understands only
            exponential modifiers like "<tt>E12</tt>", and does not
            understand these alternate exponential modifiers, nor the
            potential use of multiple exponential identifiers within the
            same literal.<br>

            of <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Datatypes">datatype
              representation</a> given earlier.<br>
            <br>
            Note that an immediately-preceding <tt>subscripts</tt>
            instruction, if present, is used to indicate subscripts if
            the chosen variable is for a composite object like a <tt>VECTOR</tt>,
            <tt>MATRIX</tt>, or <tt>ARRAY</tt>.<br>
            <br>
            As a special case, the provided scope index can be -1.&nbsp;
            This is used within the scope of a <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> if
            the identifier is for a variable that's in the <tt>ASSIGN</tt>
            clause of the <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>'s definition.&nbsp; In
            this case, the value that is fetched is not from the local
            scope of the <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>, but rather that of the
            corresponding variable in the <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clause of the
            call to the procedure.&nbsp; To clarify, consider the
            following sample HAL/S code:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>P: PROCEDURE ASSIGN(X);</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = X;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>CLOSE P;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>...</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>CALL P ASSIGN(Z);</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            Not surprisingly, the compilation of "<tt>Y = X;</tt>"
            involves the PALMAT <tt>fetch</tt> instruction, but what
            needs to be fetched is not the value of <tt>X</tt> local to
            <tt>P</tt>, but rather the variable <tt>Z</tt> in an
            entirely different scope.&nbsp; The actual PALMAT
            instruction generated is <tt>{'fetch': (-1, X)}</tt>,
            causing the emulator to determine at runtime that <tt>X</tt>
            must be replaced (by <tt>Z</tt>) and that -1 must be
            replaced (by <tt>Z</tt>'s scope index).<br>
            <br>
            Since <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> calls can be nested, it may be
            that when an <tt>ASSIGN</tt> alias like this is resolved,
            it may turn out to be yet another <tt>ASSIGN</tt> alias
            (with a scope index of -1), thus resulting in another search
            to resolve that alias.&nbsp; And this process could (but
            wouldn't necessarily) continue for however many levels the <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>
            calls are nested.<br>
            <br>
            If some manner is found in the future of having the
            compiler's code-generator perform this lookup at compile
            time rather than forcing the emulator to do it at runtime,
            then the exception for <tt>index=-1</tt> will become
            unnecessary, though emulator code for it will be retained
            (to avoid the necessity of recompilation) if that situation
            arises.&nbsp; The preliminary implementation of the emulator
            transparently replaces these indirect references directly
            within the identifier dictionary whenever it performs one of
            these searches, so any given search is never performed more
            than once in any session.</td>

It has a variable number of operands, terminated by a sentinel (Python <tt>{'sentinel'}</tt> in the preliminary implementation).  The operand at the top of the computation stack is the repetition factor.  The remaining operands on the computation stack, down to the first sentinel encountered, comprise the sequence to be replicated.  Any operands among these latter which are composites — i.e., <tt>VECTOR</tt>, <tt>MATRIX</tt>, or <tt>ARRAY</tt> — are "unraveled" in row-major order to their constituent simple values in the process.  (The handling of unraveling of a <tt>STRUCTURE</tt> is TBD.)  The Python value <tt>None</tt> is also an allowed operand, and indicated an unused position in the sequence.  If the repetition factor is immediately followed by the sentinel without intervening operands to be replicated, it means that the value <tt>None</tt> is being replicated.  The value <tt>{'fill'}</tt> (in the preliminary Python-based implementation) can also be present as the final operand preceding the sentinel. (It corresponds to a trailing "*" in HAL/S, meaning that all remaining positions are left uninitialized. But since that's the default behavior of the emulator in the preliminary implementation anyway, the fill element is essentially ignored.)  All of the operands, including the sentinel, are popped from the computation stack, and replaced with the desired replicated sequence of operands (and <i>no</i> added sentinel).  <br></p>

          <td valign="top">This operation is difficult to describe
            concisely, because unlike almost all other PALMAT
            instructions (which are intended to be simple building
            blocks for flexibly implementing more-complex operations),
            this instruction performs a rather complex operation for a
            dedicated purpose.&nbsp; Its observable effects are simple,
            however:&nbsp; Two operands are popped from the computation
            stack, and a single <tt>BOOLEAN</tt> is pushed onto the
            stack in their place.<br>
            <br>
            Conceptually, if you have a HAL/S statement of the form<br>
            <blockquote><tt>DO FOR [TEMPORARY] X = Y TO Z BY T; ...;
                END;</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            then the <tt>+&gt;&lt;</tt> PALMAT instruction is used for
            updating the loop variable <tt>X</tt> to <tt>X+T</tt> and
            then comparing the result to <tt>Z</tt> to determine if the
            end-condition of the for-loop has been met, taking into
            account for the comparison whether the step-size <tt>T</tt>
            is positive or negative.<br>
            <br>
            The stack setup for this instruction is that <tt>T</tt> is
            operand1 (the top of stack) and <tt>Z</tt> is operand2 (the
            next-to-top).&nbsp; The <tt>index</tt> and <tt>identifier</tt>
            encoded in the instruction itself specify the loop variable
            <tt>X</tt>.<br>
            <br>
            Specifically, the <tt>+&gt;&lt;</tt> instruction can be
            said to begin with the equivalent of the PALMAT instructions<br>
            <blockquote><tt>{'fetch': (index, X)}</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>{'operator': '+'}</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>{'store': (index, X)}</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            which update the loop variable in memory and leave the
            updated value of it at the top of the stack.&nbsp; Depending
            on whether <tt>T</tt> is positive or negative, <tt>+&gt;&lt;</tt>
            then ends up with the equivalent of either the PALMAT
            instruction<br>
            <blockquote><tt>{'operator': '&gt;'}</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            or <br>
            <blockquote><tt>{'operator': '&lt;'}</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            respectively, either of which removes all remaining operands
            from the stack, leaving a single <tt>TRUE</tt> or <tt>FALSE</tt>
            to tell us if the end-condition has been met.<br>

          <td valign="top">This PALMAT instruction is related to a
            built-in function I've invented to aid creation of
            validation programs written in HAL/S for the "modern" HAL/S
            compiler, but not present in original implementations of
            HAL/S.&nbsp; The <tt>typeof</tt> instruction is generated
            when something like the following appears in a HAL/S
            expression:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>typeof('<i>IDENTIFIER</i>')</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            Here, <tt>typeof</tt> is my invented built-in function and
            <tt><i>IDENTIFIER</i></tt> is the name of any defined
            identifier within the scope, presented as a HAL/S
            string.&nbsp; Note that so-called carat-quotations should <i>not</i>
            be used.&nbsp; Name-mangling prefixes, if known, can be used
            or not, but I'd recommend <i>not</i> doing so since the
            emulator can find the identifiers without them anyway
            (albeit more slowly) and by omitting them you avoid
            potentially providing them incorrectly.<br>
            <br>
            The instruction pops the operand string from the computation
            stack and replaces it with an <tt>ARRAY</tt> of strings
            that describe the attributes of the chosen identifier.&nbsp;
            In essence it provides much the same information as the
            modern HAL/S interpreter's <tt>`data</tt> command, but in a
            form available to a test program written in HAL/S
            itself.&nbsp; The <tt>ARRAY</tt> is one-dimensional, of
            length 20, and has the following entries.&nbsp; (In general,
            an entry of an empty string, "", indicates an unused
            position.)<br>
            <ol>
              <li>The datatype of the identifier, which is one of the following:  "MISSING" (if the identifier is not found), "INTEGER", "SCALAR", "VECTOR", "MATRIX", "BIT", "CHARACTER", "STRUCTURE", "LABEL", "EVENT", or "?" (indicating a datatype <tt>typeof</tt> cannot identify, presumably due to inadequate implementation).</li>
              <li>The maximum length of a bit-string or character-string, the length of a vector, or the number of rows of a matrix. <br></li>
              <li>The number of columns of a matrix; empty otherwise.</li>
              <li>Stringified value of a <tt>CONSTANT</tt> clause in the declaration.  In the case of an <tt>INTEGER</tt> or <tt>SCALAR</tt>, this is just the numerical value formatted as a string.  In the case of a bit-string, this is the "<i>N</i>, <i>L</i>", where <i>N</i> is the integer value of the array and <i>L</i> is the length in bits.  In the case of a <tt>VECTOR</tt> or <tt>MATRIX</tt>, it is an unraveling of all of the data, separated by commas and a space.  In general, floating-point numbers are rounded to no more than 5 fractional decimal places if the numbers are small enough that there is no E-style exponent.</li>
              <li>Stringified value of an <tt>INITIAL</tt> clause in the declaration.</li>
              <li>Reserved for future use.  (These reserved positions are for attributes such as <tt>DOUBLE</tt>, <tt>AUTOMATIC</tt>, <tt>STATIC</tt>, and so on, which I haven't yet chosen to implement in <tt>typeof</tt> but may at some point.)</li>

            Moreover, <tt>typeofv</tt> can analyze any datatype found
            on the computation stack, and that's not quite the same as
            the datatypes accessible to <tt>typeof</tt>.&nbsp; Some
            additional types reported by <tt>typeofv</tt> but not by <tt>typeof</tt>
            are: "SENTINEL" (for <tt>{'sentinel'}</tt> objects), "*"
            (for <tt>{'fill'}</tt> objects), "POINTER" (for pointers to
            identifiers, from the PALMAT <tt>fetchp</tt> instruction),
            and "NONE" for uninitialized data.&nbsp; Most of these extra
            types actually cannot appear to <tt>typeofv</tt> for <i>correctly</i>-generated









            and -executed PALMAT, but remember that the purpose of <tt>typeofv</tt>

          <td valign="top">The <tt>store</tt> instruction mostly has
            the same characteristics as the <tt>fetch</tt> instruction
            (see above), except that it stores the top of the
            computation stack into a specified variable instead of
            vice-versa.&nbsp; In particular, it has the same exception
            of <tt>index=-1</tt> as do <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clauses.<br>
            <br>
            Note, though, that the operand is <i>not</i> popped from
            the computation stack, and remains on the stack even after
            its value has been stored elsewhere.&nbsp; This is to
            facilitate HAL/S capability of performing assignments to
            multiple variables in a single assignment statement.&nbsp;
            See also the <tt>storepop</tt> and <tt>pop</tt>
            instructions below.<br>
            <br>
            Note also that the <tt>store</tt> instruction will perform
            any automatic type conversions (if possible) needed to make
            the operand conform to the attributes of the variable into
            which the value is supposed to be stored.&nbsp; It makes
            these conversions in the manner specified in the HAL/S
            documentation.&nbsp; For example, if the operand is a Python
            float and the variable for storage is a HAL/S <tt>INTEGER</tt>
            (i.e., if in the identifier dictionary it has the attribute
            <tt>"integer":True</tt>), then the operand will be rounded
            to the nearest integer before storage.&nbsp; It's worth
            noting explicitly that these automatic conversions include
            arithmetical-to-string, and string-to-arithmetical.&nbsp;
            Thus if we tried to store the number 1 to a string variable,
            it would be stored as the string '1'.<br>

            The equivalence is not exact in one particular case, namely
            if <i>all</i> of the following conditions are present:<br>
            <ul>

              <li>the value on the computation stack is also a one-dimensional array (though obviously having some specific length rather than *).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If all of these conditions are true, the value on the stack is popped into the <tt>identifier</tt>'s "value" attribute <i>and</i> the dimensions of the <tt>identifier</tt> in its attribute list are rewritten to match those of the popped array.  This gimmick is used to implement the HAL/S feature of declaring one-dimensional <tt>ARRAY</tt> subroutine parameters as <tt>ARRAY(*)</tt> and allowing the subroutine itself to determine the array-length dynamically using the <tt>SIZE()</tt> RTL function. <br></p>
            <p>I say that the identifier was "initially" declared as <tt>ARRAY(*)</tt> to make it clear that any implementation must have the ability to still determine the original declaration on subsequent calls to the subroutine <i>after</i> <tt>storepop</tt> has overwritten the originally-declared length of * with some explicit number, because on the next call to the subroutine the length of the array passed to it may differ.  In this preliminary PALMAT implementation, the identifier is assigned a new attribute, "flex" (value <tt>True</tt>), to indicate that the original length was * but has since been changed.<br></p>

            location.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Specifications of the form <tt>(indexD, identifier)</tt>
            transfer control to a PALMAT instruction (in the scope
            having the specified index <tt>indexD</tt>) having the
            associated symbolic label "<tt>identifier</tt>".&nbsp; Such
            symbolic labels are attached to a PALMAT instruction by
            means of an added "<tt>label</tt>" field.&nbsp; For example,
            in the preceding section we encountered the PALMAT <tt>write</tt>
            instruction, which had the form <tt>{'write': lun}</tt>.&nbsp;










            To attach a symbolic label (say "<tt>MYLABEL</tt>") to the
            write instruction, the instruction would be modified to <tt>{'write':










              lun, 'label': 'MYLABEL'}</tt>.&nbsp; Note, however, that
            the <tt>indexD</tt> is the index of the scope in which the
            <tt>identifier</tt> is <i>defined</i>, and not the scope in
            which the targetted location resides.<br>
            <br>
            Specifications of the form <tt>(indexT, offset)</tt>
            instead transfer control to the specific numeric <tt>offset</tt>
            within the PALMAT instruction stream in the scope having the
            index <tt>indexT</tt>.&nbsp; Thus the <tt>indexT</tt> is

            <br>
            The variant in which the instruction contains both a "<tt>goto</tt>"
            key and a "<tt>symbolicLabel</tt>" key is a hybrid of the
            two above.&nbsp; The compiler's code-generator will have
            generated the <tt>(indexD, identifier)</tt> variant of the
            instruction, but after executing the instruction once, the
            emulator will have chosen to transparently replace it by the
            <tt>(indexT, offset)</tt> form in order to avoid having to
            perform the same identifier-lookup again if the same
            instruction is revisited later.&nbsp; The emulator saves the
            original form in a newly-created "<tt>symbolicLabel</tt>"
            field for debugging purposes, but does not itself use the

            built-in function that instead would be invoked by the <tt>function</tt>
            instruction).&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            In terms of the setup for this instruction, the parameters
            of the <tt>FUNCTION</tt> or <tt>PARAMETER</tt> are placed
            on the computation stack, with the first parameter being the
            top of the stack, the second parameter being next to the
            top, and so on.&nbsp; Each such subroutine has a fixed
            number of parameters, invariable, and it must pop all of
            those parameters from the stack when it is <tt>CALL</tt>'d.<br>
            <br>
            As far as the return address of the subroutine is concerned,
            the <tt>call</tt> instruction automatically creates a key
            called "<tt>RETURN</tt>" in the <tt>subroutine</tt>'s scope
            to hold it.&nbsp; Realize that subroutines in HAL/S are not
            reentrant, so this "<tt>RETURN</tt>" key cannot accidentally
            be overwritten by nested calls.&nbsp; As far as
            multiprocessing is concerned, separate programs running
            simultaneously would have separate clones of the
            subroutine's scope, and thus separate "<tt>RETURN</tt>"
            keys, and therefore also would not accidentally overwrite
            the return value.<br>
            <br>
            The instruction variant which includes the "<tt>assignments</tt>"
            key is only present for <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> calls, but this
            alone cannot be used by the emulator to differentiate
            between <tt>FUNCTION</tt> vs <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> calls,
            since some <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> definitions do not have an <tt>ASSIGN</tt>
            clause.&nbsp; Recall that in HAL/S, both the code which
            declares a procedure, such as<br>
            <blockquote><tt>P: PROCEDURE(...) ASSIGN(...); ...; CLOSE P;</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            and the code which calls the procedure,<br>
            <blockquote><tt>CALL P(...) ASSIGN(...);</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            <i>typically</i> but not always have <tt>ASSIGN</tt>
            clauses, with each identifier listed in the
            procedure-definition's <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clause being paired
            with a variable in the call's <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clause when
            the <tt>CALL</tt> occurs.&nbsp; The "<tt>assignments</tt>"
            field in the <tt>call</tt> instruction lists the variables
            selected by the function call's <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clause and
            their relationships to the corresponding variables in the
            procedure's <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clause.&nbsp; This may seem
            inelegant, but it obviates the need for having constructs
            like "pointers" to variables, and it eliminates within the
            parameter lists of <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>s the need to somehow
            distinguish explicit values vs pointers to variables.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps this is best illustrated by an example.&nbsp;
            Consider the following HAL/S code, in the global scope (0):<br>
            <blockquote><tt>P: PROCEDURE(X) ASSIGN(Y); DECLARE X, Y; Y =
                X; CLOSE P;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>DECLARE Y INITIAL(5), Z;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>CALL P(Y) ASSIGN(Z);</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            Thus we have a <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>, <tt>P</tt>, which does
            nothing more than assign <tt>Y</tt> (from its <tt>ASSIGN</tt>
            clause) the value <tt>X</tt> (its sole parameter).&nbsp;
            When the <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> is called, with a parameter
            equal to 5, its <tt>ASSIGN</tt> clause specifies the
            variable <tt>Z</tt>.&nbsp; So while <tt>P</tt> is
            executing in the context of this <tt>CALL</tt>, it's own <tt>Y</tt>
            is identified with the calling code's <tt>Z</tt>.&nbsp; In
            other words, when <tt>P(5)</tt> is called, we'd expect the
            calling code's <tt>Z</tt> variable to be set to 5.<br>
            <br>
            In terms of the PALMAT instructions generated by the
            compiler, the <tt>CALL</tt> looks like this:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>{'fetch': (0, 'Y')}<br>
                {'call': (0, 'l_P'), 'assignments': {'Y': (0, 'Z')}}</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            (Recall that <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> names are mangled by the
            compiler with an added prefix "<tt>l_</tt>".)&nbsp; So the
            emulator must be able to preserve the dictionary stored in
            the "<tt>assignments</tt>" field of the <tt>call</tt>
            instruction, and use it as a source of aliases of variables
            within the <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>.&nbsp; As mentioned for the <tt>fetch</tt>
            instruction, variables which must be aliased in this fashion
            due to their presence in the <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>'s <tt>ASSIGN</tt>
            clause are represented as belonging to scope -1.&nbsp; Since
            there is no scope -1, the emulator looks in this "<tt>assignments</tt>"
            dictionary to determine the actual scope index and
            identifier.&nbsp; The PALMAT code generated for PROCEDURE P
            looks like the following, <i>in toto</i>:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>{'storepop': (1, 'X')}</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>{'fetch': (1, 'X')}</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>{'storepop': (-1, 'Y')}</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>{'return': 1}</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            The first instruction pops the operand from the computation
            stack and store's it in <tt>PROCEDURE P</tt>'s own <tt>X</tt>
            variable.&nbsp; It then pushes the value of <tt>X</tt> back
            onto the stack — a clever code optimizer could simply remove
            both of the first two instructions — in preparation for the
            third instruction.&nbsp; For that third instruction, the
            emulator looks at the index of -1, consults the "<tt>assignments</tt>",










            and (in effect, but not literally) replaces the entire third
            instruction by <tt>{'storepop': (0, 'Z')}</tt>.<br>

            The first variant of the instruction is for return from a <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>,
            while the second variant is for return from a <tt>FUNCTION</tt>.&nbsp;










            The distinction is that while either type of subroutine will
            have popped all of its input parameters from the computation
            stack, the <tt>FUNCTION</tt> will have additionally pushed
            its return value back onto the stack before returning.&nbsp;
            Thus for a <tt>{'return": 1}</tt> the computation stack
            will be left empty, while for a <tt>{'return': 2}</tt> the
            emulator will not clean up the computation stack.&nbsp; In
            principle, for correctly written code the computation stack
            should have the correct number of values on it anyway, so
            the emulator shouldn't have to do anything different in the
            two cases.&nbsp; In practice, this can be used at runtime to
            detect conditions like functions not returning any value or
            procedures which do return values.<br>

            statements.&nbsp; Its action is as follows:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>It pops its operand from the top of the computation stack.  This operand must be an <tt>INTEGER</tt> or <tt>SCALAR</tt>; if a <tt>SCALAR</tt>, it is rounded to an <tt>INTEGER</tt>.</li>
              <li>The <tt>prefix</tt> specified in the instruction is a string.  For PALMAT generated by the compiler from a <tt>DO CASE</tt> statement, prefix is always "<tt>dc_</tt>", but in principle it could be something else.</li>
              <li>The <tt>prefix</tt> and the operand are used to construct an identifier by concatenating a suffix to the <tt>prefix</tt>:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If the operand is &lt; 1, then the suffix is "else".</li>
                <li>If the operand is ≥ 1, then suffix is the operand formatted as a string.  But if this identifier is not defined in the current scope, then the suffix is changed to "else". <br></li>
              </ul>
              <li>But if this identifier is not defined in the current scope, the suffix is changed to "exit".</li>
              <li>Control is transferred to the instruction in the current scope having the identifier as a symbolic label.<br></li>
            </ol>
            <p>For example, if prefix is "<tt>dc_</tt>" and the number 5 is at the top of the computation stack, then the case instruction attempts to transfer control to the symbolic label <tt>dc_5</tt>, but if the symbolic label <tt>dc_5</tt> is not defined in the current scope it instead tries to transfer control to <tt>dc_else</tt>, and if <tt>dc_else</tt> isn't defined then it at last transfers control to <tt>dc_exit</tt>.<br></p>
            <p>Explanation:  In a <tt>DO CASE</tt> statement, the compiler's code-generator assigns the symbolic label <tt>dc_else</tt> to the <tt>DO CASE</tt> statement's <tt>ELSE</tt> clause (if there is one).  It similarly assigns the symbolic labels <tt>dc_1</tt>, <tt>dc_2</tt>, <tt>dc_3</tt>, ... to the various statements comprising the different cases in the statement, and finally places the symbolic label <tt>dc_exit</tt> at the very end. <br></p>
            <p>Finally, while it is true that <tt>DO CASE</tt> statements can be nested, since each <tt>DO CASE</tt> statement will reside in its own PALMAT scope, there is no conflict between the <tt>dc_X</tt> labels of the nested statements.<br></p>

The top element of the computation stack is the first subscript, the next-to-top is the 2nd subscript, and so on.  Upon execution, the <tt>subscripts</tt> instruction pops all of these from the instruction stack and stores them in some implementation-dependent way to be applied to the succeeding PALMAT instruction.<br></p>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br>This instruction may also appear in standalone computation of subscripts, as may occur when processing the variable-names appearing in the left-hand side of a HAL/S assignment statement, and thus appear as the final step in such an evaluation, without there being any succeeding PALMAT instruction at all.<br></p>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br>The subscripts appearing on the computation stack are of four possible forms:<br></p>
            <ol>
              <li>A simple <tt>INTEGER</tt> or <tt>SCALAR</tt> (which will be automatically rounded to an INTEGER during execution) picks out a single element along the affected dimension.</li>
              <li>A Python list, <tt>[</tt><tt><i><tt><i>length</i></tt></i></tt><i><i>, </i></i><tt><i>start</i>]</tt>, of two <tt>INTEGER</tt>s indicates a range of <tt><i>length</i></tt> elements along the affected dimension.  This corresponds to the HAL/S "<tt><i>length</i> AT <i>start</i></tt>" subscripting convention.  HAL/S requires <tt><i>length</i></tt> (2 up to the dimensionality of the corresponding index) to be known at compile time, with <i><tt>start</tt></i> being computable, but PALMAT doesn't enforce compile-time computability.  See also <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Computations">the <tt>sliceAT</tt> instruction</a>.</li>
              <li>A Python tuple, <tt>(<i>start</i>, <i>end</i>)</tt>, of two <tt>INTEGER</tt>s indicates a range of <tt><i>end</i>-<i>start</i>+1</tt> elements along the affected dimension, beginning at <tt><i>start</i></tt> and ending at <i><tt>end</tt></i>.  This corresponds to the HAL/S subscripting convention "<tt><i>start</i></tt><tt> TO <i>end</i></tt>".  HAL/S requires both start and end to be known (or computable) at compile-time. See also <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Computations">the <tt>sliceTO</tt> instruction</a>.</li>
              <li>A Python set <tt>{'fill'}</tt> is used for a subscript specified using the HAL/S, and it is placed on the computation stack by a <tt>fill</tt> instruction.<br></li>
            </ol>
            <p>For the other subscripting conventions of HAL/S, namely "<tt>#</tt>" and "<tt>#</tt><tt>±<i>N</i></tt>" to mean the last element in the affected direction and elements relative to it, the code generator performs the trick of replacing <tt>#</tt> by a very large integer (2,000,000,000 at this writing).  The emulator performs the reverse trick of subtracting this constant from very large superscripts, and instead adding the width of the corresponding dimension to the subscript.  This allows the emulator to compute subscript expressions involving <tt>#</tt> without having to provide special software separate from the normal expression software to do so.  However, this limits the maximum width of any dimension of a composite object to half of the large constant.<br></p>
            <p>Note that although in an <tt>ARRAY</tt> of <tt>VECTOR</tt>, <tt>MATRIX</tt>, <tt>BIT</tt> or <tt>CHARACTER</tt> HAL/S visually distinguishes between the <tt>ARRAY</tt> indices and the <tt>VECTOR</tt>/<tt>MATRIX</tt>/<tt>BIT</tt>/<tt>CHARACTER</tt> indices by having a colon (:) between the two groups indices rather than a comma (,), PALMAT makes no such distinction.  Rather, if subscripts are present, it expects the number of subscripts to correspond <i>either</i> to the dimensionality of the <tt>ARRAY</tt> or else to the dimensionality of the <tt>ARRAY</tt> <i>plus</i> the dimensionality of the <tt>VECTOR</tt>/<tt>MATRIX</tt>/<tt>BIT</tt>/<tt>CHARACTER</tt> objects comprising the <tt>ARRAY</tt>.</p>
