  <h2><a name="Prerequisites" id="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
  for Binary-Package Installation<br></h2>Obviously, I'm not in a
  position to test on every platform known to man, but the
  following represents my beliefs based on the testing I've been
  able do do.&nbsp; Note that when I say that Virtual AGC "works"
  on a given platform, it may still be subject to some <a href=
  "#Some_platform-specific_odditities">limitations or reduced
  functionality</a> in some areas.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>All platforms:&nbsp; Install <a href=
    "http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl/Tk</a> if not already installed.&nbsp;
    I don't know how pervasive a problem it is—i.e., which
    operating systems or versions of <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Tck/Tk</span> it affects—but in recently
    trying to install <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> on Microsoft Vista, I found
    that the installation program does not create a file called
    "wish.exe", but instead creates a file called
    "wish85.exe".&nbsp; This prevents certain features of Virtual
    AGC from working.&nbsp; In the case of Windows Vista, I fixed
    it by duplicating the file "c:\tcl\bin\wish85.exe" and calling
    the duplicate "c:\tcl\bin\wish.exe".&nbsp; Sorry about this,
    but I don't honestly see what I can do about it.<br></li>
    <li>Linux:&nbsp; The <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">X-Window</span> system, <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">xterm</span>, and <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> libraries must be
    installed.<br></li>
    <li>Operating systems:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Mac OS X:&nbsp;<br></li>
      <ul>
        <li>10.4 and later, Intel and PowerPC, are believed to
        work.<br></li>
        <li>10.2 or prior is known <span style=
        "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> to
        work.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Windows:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>XP is known to work.</li>
        <li>Vista and Windows 7 are known to work but <a href=
        "#Some_platform-specific_odditities">various
        workarounds</a> need to be applied and some patience may be
        needed.<br></li>
        <li>Windows 98 or prior is known <span style=
        "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> to
        work.</li>
        <li>Only 32-bit systems were tried; the behavior on 64-bit
        systems is unknown.<br></li>
        <li>Others (2000) are untried and unknown.<br></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Linux 'x86:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Fedora Core 4 and later versions are believed to work;
        Fedora Core 1 is known <span style=
        "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> to
        work.<br></li>
        <li>Ubuntu 7.04 and later versions are believed to
        work.</li>
        <li>SuSE 10.1 and later versions are believed to work.</li>
        <li>Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems seem okay.<br></li>
        <li>Other distributions and earlier versions of those
        listed above: untried and unknown.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>FreeBSD:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently, I am working only with PC-BSD 7.1, which is
        based on FreeBSD 7.2.&nbsp; In the past it worked also with
        PC-BSD 7.02, which is based on FreeBSD 7.1.&nbsp; There is
        no binary package for this platform, but if built from
        source it seems to work.<br></li>
      </ul>
      <li>OpenSolaris:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently, I am working only with OpenSolaris
        0811.&nbsp; There is no binary package for this platform,
        but if built from source it partially works.&nbsp; I'm not
        satisfied with it at this point.<br></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="Downloads" id="Downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>The
  development snapshot is versioned, and all released snapshots
  remain available perpetually in the <a href=
  "Downloads/">archive</a>.&nbsp;
  However, for economy, binary downloads are not versioned and
  simply are current with the latest development snapshot.&nbsp;
  The GitHub repository represents a separate source tree that was
  forked at some point into a subversion repository at Google Code,
  then merged back in May 2009, and then finally converted to a
  GitHub repository when Google Code ceased active operation;
  therefore, all development snapshots after May 2009 can be found
  in the GitHub repository, but not prior to that time.<br>

  </table>Note that the Mac OS X binary package includes a program
  called <a style="font-weight: bold;" href=

  haven't written, but which is available under the GNU GPL
  license.&nbsp; If you so desire, you can download the
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> source code
  for the version whose binary is being provided by <a href=

  clicking here</a>.&nbsp; I have neither modified nor recompiled
  this code.&nbsp; Neither the <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> source code nor binary is

  You should note, by the way, that alternate installation options
  might be available at now-archival-only <a href=
  "http://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/">Google Code page</a> for
  certain specific computer configurations. (Whereas my "standard"
  install focuses almost entirely on wide cross-platform
  consistency.) While I won't try to track those alternate packages
  in detail here, I'm aware that (for example) there's a 64-bit
  Fedora 12 RPM there that's consistent with the 201000220
  snapshot.&nbsp; I'm told by Onno Hommes that the following
  advantages can be expected from using the RPM rather than my
  "standard" install:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Installation is faster and better-behaved if some auxiliary
    requirements like Tcl/Tk aren't installed.</li>
    <li>Better compliance to Linux standards, such as installation
    under /opt.</li>
    <li>Better permissions settings for some files.</li>
    <li>Easier upgrade.<br></li>

  Note to FreeBSD users:&nbsp; You may anticipate that the Linux

  <h3><a name="Source_Highlighting" id=
  "Source_Highlighting"></a>AGC/AEA Source-Code Syntax
  Highlighting</h3>Onno Hommes has developed AGC and AEA specific
  syntax-highlighting extensions for various editing programs often
  used for developing software source code:&nbsp; <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Kate</span>, <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">KWrite</span>, <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Kdevelop</span>, <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Eclipse</span>, <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">vim</span>, <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">TextPad</span>, and (maybe) <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">emacs</span>. &nbsp; Although there's no
  real way to integrate this feature with Virtual AGC software
  proper, each of the available downloads (source-code development
  snapshot and Linux/Win32/Mac binary installers) do provide the
  appropriate configuration files for updating the various
  text-editing programs.&nbsp; There is also a file called
  EnableSyntaxAGC.odt included there which contains instructions
  for doing so.&nbsp; (At present, you may want to use the free
  <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> office
  suite to read this file.)&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  For a binary installation, the files just mentioned can be found
  under the installation directory (typically
  "~/VirtualAGC/Resources/SyntaxHighlight" in Linux, "c:\Program
  Files\Virtual AGC\Resources\SyntaxHighlight" in Windows, and
  "~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources/SyntaxHighlight" in
  Mac OS X).&nbsp; For a development snapshot, look in
  "yaAGC/Contributed/SyntaxHighlight".<br>
  <br>
  Here's a nice screenshot (click to enlarge) of what source
  highlighting looks like in <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Kdevelop</span>.&nbsp; As you can see, it's
  a lot more pleasant to read the AGC source code with the
  highlighting than without it.<br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="SyntaxAGC-Kdevelop.jpg"><img style=
    "border: 2px solid ; width: 300px; height: 240px;" alt=
    "Screenshot of source highlighting in KDevelop" title=
    "Click to enlarge" src="SyntaxAGC-Kdevelop-thumb.jpg" height=
    "240" width="300" border="0"></a>
  </div><br>
  Of course, syntax highlighting is also provided when browsing
  AGC/AEA source code from the <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI—thanks to enhancements
  to the assemblers prompted by seeing Onno's text-editor
  extensions in action—but the <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI syntax-highlighting
  depends on having previously assembled the programs and does not
  provide developmental editing of the source code.
  <h3><a name="Debugging" id="Debugging"></a>gdb-compatible AGC/AEA
  debugging</h3>Onno has also done a lot of work on changing the
  debugging options of the AGC and AEA simulations—i.e., the
  ability to debug AGC and AEA assembly-language code—from the
  original methods I conceived to a <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>-compatible method in which
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span> commands and GUI
  front-ends like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kdbg</span>,
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>, or
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">EMACS</span> could be
  used.&nbsp; This is largely working.&nbsp; The official
  explanation is maintained by Onno at <a href=
  "http://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/">the separate website Onno
  has set up</a>.&nbsp;<br>
  <h4><a name="One-time_setup_procedure_for" id=

  one-time setup steps needed to make CUI-based debugging via
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span> work
  directly with the <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI.&nbsp; With some luck,
  we may be able to eventually provide scripts to automate the
  setup, but for now it's a manual procedure.&nbsp; <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">Note that I'm describing work in progress,
  and so my description may not yet be fully accurate</span>.<br>
  <br>
  In the explanation that follows, we'll need to refer to the
  folder in which Virtual AGC is installed, which differs from
  platform to platform and according to your installation or build
  choices.&nbsp; By default, the installation directory will be
  something like:.
  <ul>
    <li>For a default Linux binary installation:&nbsp;
    "~/VirtualAGC".</li>
    <li>For a default Win32 binary installation:&nbsp; "c:\Program
    Files\Virtual AGC".</li>
    <li>For a default Mac OS X binary installation:&nbsp;
    "~/VirtualAGC.app/Contents".</li>
    <li>For a native build from source code, it's more complex, but
    could be:&nbsp; "yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC".</li>
  </ul>For simplicity we'll just refer to it as <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>.&nbsp; Also, we'll always
  pretend for simplicity that the character '/' is used as a path
  separator, even though it is really '\' on Windows.<br>
  <br>
  So here is the setup procedure:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span></a> for your desired
    development platform.&nbsp; (If you are developing/debugging
    your AGC/AEA code in Linux, <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span> may be in your Linux
    distribution's packaging system.)</li>
    <li>Installation of AGC/AEA syntax-highlighting enhancement for
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>:</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
      <li>Copy the contents of <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>/Resources/SyntaxHighlight/CodeBlocks/lexers/
      to the lexers/ folder of your <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span> installation:</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>For a default Linux installation:&nbsp;
        "/usr/share/codeblocks/lexers".</li>
        <li>For a default Win32 installation:&nbsp; TBD.</li>
        <li>For a default Mac OS X installation:&nbsp; TBD.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Run <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>.<br></li>
      <li>Verify installation of syntax-highlighting by selecting
      Settings/Editor/Syntax-highlighting from the main menu.&nbsp;
      If "AGC Assembly" and "AEA assembly" are among the choices in
      the language-selection drop-down list, then the
      syntax-highlighting enhancement has been installed
      properly.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Configuration of AGC toolchain:</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
      <li>From the main menu, select
      Settings/Compiler-and-debugger.</li>
      <li>In the Global-compiler-settings section:</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Make sure that "GNU gcc Compiler" is the "Selected
        compiler".</li>
        <li>Click the "Copy" button and in the "Add new compiler"
        pop-up window that appears, choose the name "AGC yaYUL
        Assembler".</li>
        <li>In the "Compiler Flags" tab, make sure that no flags
        are enabled.</li>
        <li>In the "Toolchain executables" tab (which you may need
        to scroll rightward to find):</li>
        <ul>
          <li value="9"><span style=
          "text-decoration: underline;">For Mac OS X only</span>,
          in the "Additional Paths" tab next to the "Program Files"
          tab, add the path "<span style=
          "font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>/MacOS".&nbsp;
          (All of the other settings below are in the "Program
          Files" tab and apply to all platforms unless stated
          otherwise.)<br></li>
          <li>For the "Compiler's installation directory" choose
          <span style="font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>.</li>
          <li>For the "C compiler", "C++ compiler", "Linker for
          dynamic libs", and "Linker for static libs" choose either
          "yaYUL" or "yaYUL.exe" depending on your platform.</li>
          <li>For the "Debugger", set "yaAGC" or "yaAGC.exe"
          depending on your platform.</li>
          <li>Leave the "Resource compiler" setting blank.</li>
          <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For
          Win32</span>, you may will probably need to change the
          "Make program" setting whatever 'make' you're actually
          using, and to add the path in which it is located to the
          "Additional Paths" tab.<br></li>
          <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For FreeBSD
          only</span>, if you are using GNU make rather than the
          default 'make' provided by the operating system, change
          the "Make program" setting to "gmake".<br></li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Configuration of AEA toolchain:&nbsp; <span style=

  <p>I would recommend reading <a href=
  "https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/blob/master/README.md#linux-1">
  the instructions at the GitHub repository</a>, which (of course)
  cover building from a Git clone of the code base.&nbsp; However,
  the following are some older (though extremely-similar)
  instructions related specifically to building from the
  development snapshot tarballs.<br></p><span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span>&nbsp; You will need
  the normal <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span> C/C++
  compiler toolchain, as well as developer packages ("dev" or
  "devel") for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"><span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> and <a href=
  "http://www.libsdl.org/"><span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">SDL</span></a>.&nbsp; I have been using the
  2.8.<i>x</i> branch of wxWidgets, as opposed (say) to the
  3.<i>x</i> branch, and I believe you probably need to do that as
  well; fortunately, both can be installed on the computer at the
  same time. These are all available in the package repositories of
  the common current Linux distributions, though figuring out what
  the package names are can be an adventure.&nbsp; Or, you can
  install them from source if you swing that way.<br>
  <br>
  From the command line, unpack the development-snapshot tarball as
  follows:<br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">tar
    --bzip2 -xf yaAGC-dev-</span><span style=
    "font-style: italic; font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">YYYYMMDD</span><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.tar.bz2</span><br>
  </div><br>
  After unpacking there will be a new directory called
  "yaAGC".&nbsp;&nbsp; To build the programs,<br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">cd
    yaAGC</span><br style=
    "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">#
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Do
    not</span> "configure".</span><br style=
    "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
    <span style=
    "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">make</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">

    <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">#
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Do
    not</span> "make install".</span><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;"><br style=
    "font-family: monospace;"></span><br>
  </div>(Note that while there is a 'configure' script provided, it
  is presently used only for setting up builds of a couple of
  now-obsoleted programs.&nbsp; Therefore, it does not matter
  whether you run it or not, nor whether it succeeds or fails.)<br>
  <br>
  You'll find that this has created a directory
  yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/, which is same as the
  installation directory provided by the binary installer program,
  <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-installer</span>.&nbsp; To match
  the default setup of the installer program, you would<br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">mv
    yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC ~/VirtualAGC</span><br>
  </div><br>
  (assuming you don't already have a directory ~/VirtualAGC/) and
  make a desktop icon called "Virtual AGC" that links to
  ~/VirtualAGC/bin/VirtualAGC.&nbsp; The image normally used for
  the desktop icon is found at&nbsp;
  ~/VirtualAGC/bin/ApolloPatch2.png.&nbsp; At this point you would
  have something equivalent to what the binary installer would have
  provided, except that you would have no uninstaller program.<br>

  <h3><a name="BuildRPI" id="BuildRPI"></a>Raspberry Pi
  (Raspbian)</h3>This really isn't any different from building it
  on <a href="#BuildLinux">any other Linux system</a>, but I'll go
  through the steps for you anyway, which should work even on a
  completely new Raspbian install.&nbsp; Laszlo Morocz provided the
  original instructions, but I have tweaked them somewhat:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Tested with the 2016-05-27 version of
    Raspbian-Jessie.<br></li>
    <li>The build goes a lot faster if you do it on (say) a
    physical hard disk on the USB port, rather than on the standard
    SD card.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can then do the following, from a command line:<br></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>sudo apt-get install wx2.8-headers libwxgtk2.8-0
    libwxgtk2.8-dev libsdl-dev libncurses5-dev liballegro4-dev
    git<br>
    git clone https://www.github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc<br>
    cd virtualagc<br>
    make<br></p>
  </blockquote>The end result of this rather lengthy process is the
  directory (within the virtualagc/ directory containing the
  complete source tree)&nbsp; called VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/,
  which in fact contains everything you need to run the program,
  which you can do either in-place, or after copying it to some
  other location.&nbsp; To actually run the program (say, in
  place), you do this:<br>
  <blockquote>
    cd VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources<br>
    ../bin/VirtualAGC<br>
  </blockquote>Or, of course, you could create a desktop icon that
  does basically this same thing.<br>
  <br>
  Laszlo mentions the additional (disquieting) fact that the CPU
  utilization rather high, and indeed if you ran every available
  option on an early-model Pi, you could find yourself using close
  to 100% of the CPU.&nbsp; For the default configuration of
  VirtualAGC (Lunar Module AGC with DSKY and Telemetry but without
  abort system or IMU), I find the following:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Pi B+:&nbsp; 80% CPU utilization.&nbsp;<br></li>
    <li>Pi 3: 40% CPU utilization.<br></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If that's too much for you, there are some things you may be
  able to do to make it more efficient.&nbsp; First, note that the
  VirtualAGC program — which isn't a component of the simulation,
  but merely a convenient graphical interface so that you don't
  have to memorize command-line options for the actual components —
  takes 25-30% of the CPU (for either of the two Pi models
  mentioned above) by itself.&nbsp; Tou don't really need to run it
  if you don't want to.&nbsp; So:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you run the simulation just once from VirtualAGC, and
    exit the simulation immediately after starting it, you'll find
    that it has automatically created a script called "simulate"
    which can be used to start that exact configuration of the
    simulation without running VirtualAGC itself.&nbsp; As a
    result, you get CPU utilizations closer to 50% or 10%,
    respectively, on the two Pi models mentioned above.&nbsp; To
    just run that script, you do this:</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>cd VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources<br>
    ./simulate<br></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're more-adventurous, and more programming-savvy,
    there may be a way to get various programs, but specifically
    yaAGC and yaAGS, to use less CPU cycles, at the cost of less
    accuracy time-wise.&nbsp; At various places in the program
    suite, individual programs are put to sleep using the
    nanosleep() function, specifically to avoid using CPU
    cycles.&nbsp; So if you search for "nanosleep", you'll often
    find nanosleeps with of req.tv_nsec=10000000 nanoseconds, or 10
    milliseconds.&nbsp; Selectively changing some of those to (say)
    100 milliseconds (100000000) or even 250 milliseconds
    (250000000) might reduce the CPU utilization of those
    particular programs.&nbsp; If you do try it and it works better
    for you, let me know!</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="FreeBSD" id="FreeBSD"></a>FreeBSD</h3>Development
  snapshots 20090405 through 20090421 could be built natively in
  PC-BSD 7.02 (based on FreeBSD 7.1), and snapshots 20090502 and
  after can be build natively on PC-BSD 7.1 (based on FreeBSD
  7.2).&nbsp; Other versions of FreeBSD may work, but I have no
  great confidence because my knowledge of FreeBSD is nil.<br>
  <br>
  As mentioned above, I would <span style=
  "font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not</span> recommend
  installing the Linux binary version of Virtual AGC.&nbsp; You may
  be able to run the installer, but if your experience is like mine
  you won't like what happens after that.&nbsp; Thus you should
  build from source instead, according to the instructions in this
  section.<br>
  <br>
  Here's the way <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> made it
  work, in PC-BSD 7.1 with its software-developer package group
  intalled:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>I installed <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> 2.8.9 from source
    into /usr/local.&nbsp; You have to do something beyond my
    understanding to get the system to find libwx*.so* at
    runtime.&nbsp; I managed to monkey it into working, but I'm not
    sure what I did, and you FreeBSD users are unlikely to care
    about my wrong methods anyhow.&nbsp; Please let me know the
    answer if you find one.<br></li>
    <li>I installed <a href=
    "http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">readline</span></a> 6.0 from
    source into /usr/local.&nbsp; (As a BSD kind of person, you may
    be tempted to install the BSD-licensed <a href=
    "http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/">editline</a> library
    instead, but it is not fully feature-compatible and cannot be
    used.)</li>
    <li>I found that <span style="font-weight: bold;">libSDL</span>
    was already installed.</li>
    <li>I installed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span>
    ("pkg_add -r tk-wrapper").<br></li>
    <li>I unpacked the Virtual AGC snapshot tarball ("<span style=
    "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">tar --bzip2 -xf
    yaAGC-dev-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span></span><span style=
    "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.tar.bz2</span>").</li>
    <li>I cd'd into the yaAGC/ directory and built ("gmake
    FREEBSD=yes").&nbsp; <span style=
    "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Do</span> <span style=

  </ul>You'll find that this has created a directory
  yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/.&nbsp; I'd suggest you should
  also<br>

  <h3><a name="Solaris" id="Solaris"></a>Solaris</h3>Note that I've
  only tried OpenSolaris 0811.&nbsp; In order to get development
  snapshot 20090503 (and hopefully beyond) to build, having no
  knowledge of Solaris, I had to do quite a lot of ignorant
  monkeying around.&nbsp; When that happens, of course, there may
  be essential steps of the process that don't get recorded, or
  extra steps that are accomplished but serve no purpose.&nbsp; I
  expect that any Solaris users are likely clever enough about
  their OS to figure these things out and let me know of
  deficiencies in my description.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  There are so many problems on Solaris right now that I'd hesitate
  to recommend using Virtual AGC in that environment.<br>
  <br>
  At any rate, here are the one-time setup steps I performed:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>I installed (or happily accepted the pre-installation, as
    the case may be) the following packages, using the package
    system:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>SUNWgnome-common-devel</li>
      <li>SUNWGtk</li>
      <li>SUNWxorg-headers</li>
      <li>FSWxorg-headers</li>
      <li>SUNWncurses</li>
      <li>SUNWtcl</li>
      <li>SUNWtk</li>
      <li>SUNWlibsdl<br></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Installed <a href=
    "http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">readline</span></a> 6.0 from
    source into /usr/local.</li>
    <li>I installed <a href=
    "http://www.wxwidgets.org/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span></a>
    2.8.9 from source into /usr/local, configuring with "configure
    --disable-shared".&nbsp; (While there is a package called
    SUNWwxwidgets which can be installed from the package system,
    in the version I tried the switches produced by `wx-config
    --cxxflags` are incompatible with <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">gcc</span>, so I eliminated it.&nbsp; Your
    luck might be better.)&nbsp; The Virtual AGC makefiles are
    simply going to take the first <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">wx-config</span> found in the PATH, so the
    present makefiles may be too simple for you if you have more
    than one version of <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> installed.</li>
    <li>I installed <a style="font-weight: bold;" href=
    "http://alleg.sourceforge.net">Allegro</a> 4.2.2 from source
    into /usr/local, configuring as "configure --enable-shared=no
    --enable-static=yes".<br></li>
    <li>I put /usr/local/bin into my PATH, or otherwise somehow get
    /usr/local/bin/wx-config linked into your PATH.<br></li>
  </ul>After that, build Virtual AGC as follows:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Unpack the Virtual AGC snapshot tarball ("<span style=
    "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">tar --bzip2 -xf
    yaAGC-dev-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span></span><span style=
    "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.tar.bz2</span>").</li>
    <li>Then 'cd' into the yaAGC/ directory and build ("make
    SOLARIS=yes").&nbsp; <span style=
    "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Do</span> <span style=
    "font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not</span> "configure"
    and <span style=
    "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">do</span> <span style=
    "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> "gmake
    install".</li>
  </ul>You'll find that this has created a directory
  yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/.&nbsp; I'd suggest you should
  also<br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">mv
    yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC ~/VirtualAGC</span><br>
  </div><br>
  (assuming you don't already have a directory ~/VirtualAGC/) and
  make a desktop icon called "Virtual AGC" that links to
  ~/VirtualAGC/bin/VirtualAGC.&nbsp; The image normally used for
  the desktop icon is found at&nbsp;
  ~/VirtualAGC/bin/ApolloPatch2.png.&nbsp; The end result of these
  manipulations is something identical to what a binary installer
  would have produced (if one existed), except that there won't be
  any uninstaller program.<br>
  <br>
  Sadly, none of the ACA simulation (joystick) programs work in
  this environment, so you'll have no joystick controls.&nbsp; But
  I suppose it's possible that this is just my test environment,
  which is a virtual machine, so you might have better luck than
  I.&nbsp;&nbsp; And don't forget to read the <a href=

  <h3><a name="Mac_OS_X" id="Mac_OS_X"></a>Mac OS X<br></h3>Note
  that <span style="font-style: italic;">personally</span> I build
  the Mac OS X version of the Virtual AGC binaries <a href=
  "#Cross-Compiling">in Linux</a> rather than in Mac OS X.&nbsp;
  Nevertheless, in development snapshot 20090415 and later, it's
  possible to build the Mac OS X version of Virtual AGC natively
  from Mac OS X 10.5.&nbsp; I've only tried it in 10.5.6 (Intel)
  myself.&nbsp; Anything I say below about building in 10.4 is pure
  speculation.&nbsp; Note also that since I don't use this
  procedure myself, you can't expect that I try it out for every
  development snapshot.&nbsp; Building the Mac version natively
  according to the instructions below gives you something
  functionally identical to the binary download package, except
  that you won't have the alternate joystick handler (<span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>), so if the primary joystick
  handler (<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>) doesn't
  work for your joystick model then you won't be able to use a
  joystick.<br>
  <br>
  Note that most of the steps below are one-time setup, and that
  the actual build after setup is complete is quite simple.<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Mac OS X 10.5 includes <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.8.4, which in theory is
    too early a version.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it appears to work and
    I won't quibble about it.&nbsp; Mac OS X 10.4 includes
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.5, which is
    definitely (I think) not going to work, so you'll want to
    install <span style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.8.9
    or later; probably you'll need to do this <a href=
    "http://www.wxwidgets.org">from source</a>.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>, which is
    needed for the joystick handler program (<span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>) is also pre-installed, but
    I haven't figured out how to use it.&nbsp; (<span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Hint</span>: if from a command line a
    program called "sdl-config" is in your PATH, you <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">don't</span> need to install <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>; if it isn't, then you
    do.)&nbsp; So what I did was to <a href=
    "http://www.libsdl.org">download the source tarball</a>, unpack
    it, configure it ("./configure"), build it ("make"), and
    install it ("sudo make install").&nbsp; This puts <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">SDL</span> into /usr/local, where it won't
    conflict with your already-installed version.</li>
    <li>From a command-line, cd to some (preferably empty) working
    directory and unpack the Virtual AGC development-snapshot
    tarball ("tar -xjf yaAGC-dev-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span>.tar.bz2"), thus creating
    a sub-folder called yaAGC/ containing the Virtual AGC source
    tree.</li>
    <li>Browse to the web to download the <a style=
    "font-weight: bold;" href=
    "http://software.jessies.org/terminator/">Terminator</a>
    application's dmg file.</li>
    <li>Double-click the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> dmg file, and once it's
    open find the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> application (<img style=
    "width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="Terminator.png" align=
    "middle" height="41" width="42">).</li>
    <li>Drag the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span>
    application from the open dmg file to the working directory in
    which you created yaAGC/ in step 3 above.<br></li>
    <li>From a command line in that working directory, make a
    tarball from Terminator.app ("tar -cjvf Terminator.app.tar.bz2
    Terminator.app").&nbsp; Once you have the tarball, you can
    eliminate the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> app itself, along with
    its dmg file.<br></li>
    <li>From the working directory (not from within the yaAGC/
    directory) you would build Virtual AGC using the command "make
    -C yaAGC MACOSX=yes".&nbsp; In the&nbsp; folder
    yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/, you should now find the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> application (<img style=
    "width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="ApolloPatch3.png"
    align="middle" height="40" width="40">).<br></li>
    <li>If you like, drag the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> application from
    yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/ to the desktop.&nbsp; (It's better to
    drag rather than to use a 'cp' command, to make sure that Mac
    OS X admits that the folder is actually an
    application.)<br></li>
    <li>You're ready to go!</li>

  quirks</a> for this platform.
  <h3><a name="BuildOther" id="BuildOther"></a>Windows<br></h3>Note
  that <span style="font-style: italic;">personally</span> I build
  the Windows version of the Virtual AGC binaries <a href=
  "download.html#Cross-Compiling">in Linux</a> rather than in
  Windows.&nbsp; However, Onno Hommes (thanks, Onno!) has worked
  out the build procedures, so for versions of May 2009 and later,
  you should be able to do a native build on Windows.&nbsp; I have
  tried it only on Windows XP and Windows 7.&nbsp; Since I have no
  interest in it myself, this capability is not tested for every
  development snapshot.&nbsp; First-time setup of the Windows box
  is somewhat time-consuming, but the build is pretty easy after
  that.&nbsp; I have information only on using open-source tools
  for this, and if you wish to use tools like Microsoft Visual C++
  you'll have to work out the details for yourself.&nbsp; (If you
  do, expect it to be easy to build the AGC and AGS CPU simulation
  programs and more difficult to build the various GUI interfaces
  such as the DSKY and DEDA.)<br>
  <br>
  The trick is to install a Linux-like environment in which to
  build the Virtual AGC software; but the Virtual AGC software
  itself does not then need the Linux-like environment to
  run.&nbsp; Here are the steps for first-time setup.&nbsp; I fear
  that a certain amount of knowledge of UNIX-like systems is
  needed, so if you are a pure Windows person you may find that the
  following steps are more trouble to figure out than they are
  worth to you.<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>
    compiler, using the downloadable setup.exe file.&nbsp; Use the
    default choices for installation directory, etc.&nbsp; Among
    the options you should choose (if given the choice) are
    installation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">g++</span>
    compiler and of <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">make</span>.</li>
    <li>Install the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">Msys</a>
    (Linux-like command shell) environment using the downloadable
    setup.exe file.<br></li>
    <li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span>, to bring
    up a command shell.&nbsp; If you are unlucky enough to have a
    Windows user name containing spaces, you will encounter
    difficulties.&nbsp; For example, my home directory in
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> is "/home/Ron
    Burkey", and this messes up some of the build steps that need
    to be performed.&nbsp; My solution to this was to create a
    directory called "/home/rburkey" and to 'cd' to that directory
    whenever starting up Msys.&nbsp; It would also be wise to
    change the value of the HOME environment variable to reflect
    this change.&nbsp; When I refer below to your "home directory",
    I mean whatever your equivalent of "/home/rburkey" is.<br></li>
    <li>Install the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL
    library</a>.&nbsp; You should find that there is a download
    file specifically labeled as a Win32 development package for
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">MinGW</span>.&nbsp; Within
    your <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> home
    directory, unpack the download file, 'cd' into the directory it
    creates, and run the command "make install-sdl
    prefix=/usr/local".&nbsp; The /usr directory withing
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> will probably
    correspond to something like c:\msys\1.0\ in your Windows
    filesystem. &nbsp; <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">All</span> software needed to build
    Virtual AGC will be installed under /usr/local, so eventually
    it will be populated with sub-directories such as
    /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib, and so
    on.&nbsp; The Virtual AGC makefiles are hard-coded to assume
    these installation locations.&nbsp; Note, however, that the
    Virtual AGC binaries you are going to create are <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">not</span> installed under
    /usr/local.</li>
    <li>Obtain a source tarball of <a href=
    "http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>.&nbsp; At present,
    Virtual AGC binary packages are always built with <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.8.9, so 2.8.9 is a safe
    choice though it is not the only choice which works.&nbsp;
    Unpack the tarball in your home directory, 'cd' into the
    directory this creates, and then do "./configure", "make", and
    "make install".&nbsp; The "configure" step will accept various
    command-line options that select unicode vs. ansi, static
    linking vs. dynamic linking, etc., but the default options seem
    to work fine.</li>
    <li>Install <a href=
    "http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/">POSIX Threads for
    Windows</a> ("pthreads").&nbsp; There may be a number of
    methods that work, but here is what I did:&nbsp; Unpack the
    source tarball, 'cd' into the directory it creates, then run
    the command "make clean GC-inlined".&nbsp; This creates various
    files that you should copy into /usr/local as follows:&nbsp;
    copy *.dll into /usr/local/bin; copy *.h into
    /usr/local/include; copy the single libpthread*.a file created
    into /usr/local/lib and rename it libpthread.a.</li>
    <li>Install <a href=
    "http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/readline.htm">GNU
    readline for Windows</a>.&nbsp; You should find zipfiles of
    both "binaries" and "developer files" are available for
    download.&nbsp; They should both be downloaded and unpacked
    into /usr/local.&nbsp; (I.e., each zipfile contains directories
    like bin/, include/, lib/, and so on, and we want these to be
    merged into /usr/local/bin/, usr/local/include/, etc.)</li>
    <li>Install a regular-expression library.&nbsp; The <a href=
    "http://www.mingw.org">MinGW project</a> has a "contributed"
    regex library ("libgnurx") that you can use.&nbsp; Download
    both the "bin" and "dev" tarballs and unpack them into
    /usr/local.<br></li>
  </ol>If all of this was done correctly, you should now be able to
  build Virtual AGC, as follows:<br>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Unpack the development tarball in your home directory: "tar
    -xjvf yaAGC-dev-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span>.tar.bz2".</li>
    <li>Build it: "make -C yaAGC WIN32=yes".</li>
    <li>On Windows 7&nbsp; (but not on XP) I found it necessary
    additionally to copy c:\MinGW\bin\mingwm10.dll to
    yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources/.&nbsp; Whether
    this is a difference between Windows 7 and XP, or whether it's
    some ghastly improvement to MinGW since the time I installed it
    last on XP, I can't say at the present time (and am not too
    motivated to figure out).<br></li>
  </ol>This will create a directory
  yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/ which is the "installation
  directory".&nbsp; When you download and run the Virtual AGC Win32
  setup.exe file, this is the directory you get, except that the
  setup program copies "lVirtualAGC/" to "c:\Program Files\" and
  renames it "Virtual AGC".&nbsp; In fact, this directory is
  relocatable, and you can move it wherever you like; nor does it
  need to remain within the <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> environment.&nbsp; Whether you
  leave this directory in place, or whether you move it to Program
  Files, you really need to create a desktop icon in order to run
  the program.&nbsp; The desktop icon should point to
  lVirtualAGC\bin\VirtualAGC.exe as the executable, and should use
  a "starting directory" of lVirtualAGC\Resources\.&nbsp; The
  graphic normally used for the desktop icon is ApolloPatch2.jpg in
  the lVirtualAGC\Resources directory.<br>

  <h3><a name="iPhone" id="iPhone"></a>iPhone</h3>For development
  snapshot 20090802 and later, it's possible to build <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>—not the entire Virtual AGC
  suite, just <b>yaAGC</b>—from (I guess) a Mac, if you've
  downloaded an iPhone development kit.&nbsp; From the "I guess" in
  the preceding sentence, you'll probably be able to deduce that
  I'm just parrotting someone else's words and don't really know
  what I'm talking about ... and you'd be right.&nbsp; The
  instructions and mods necessary to do it came from Alberto Galdo
  (thanks, Alberto!).&nbsp; If you try it and it doesn't work,
  blame me for not implementing Alberto's instructions
  properly.&nbsp; We'll zero in on it eventually.<br>
  <br>
  To build, simply 'cd' into the yaAGC/yaAGC/ folder and do
  this:<br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    make IPHONE=yes<br>
  </div><br>
  As for how useful <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
  by itself is, it's obviously only marginally useful until such
  time as there's a DSKY.&nbsp; You should be able to do
  command-line debugging, however, so you could in theory run and
  debug AGC code.<br>
  <br>
  <h3><a name="Cross-Compiling" id=
  "Cross-Compiling"></a>Cross-Compiling</h3>On the
  very-low-probability chance that somebody actually wants to know
  how to build the Windows and Mac versions on a Linux box, it's
  very simple to do.&nbsp; It is, however, very wasteful of
  calendar time (if not personal time), computer resources, and
  bandwidth to set up the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">first</span> time, so I would not advise
  you to do it on a lark:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>The oldest Linux on which I've made this work is Fedora
    Core 5, so presumably any newer Linux would be okay.&nbsp; You
    will need the normal <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">gcc</span> C/C++ compilier toolchain, as
    well as developer packages ("dev" or "devel") for <a href=
    "http://www.wxwidgets.org/"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> (2.8.9 or later),
    <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">SDL</span></a>, and <a style=
    "font-weight: bold;" href=
    "http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro</a>.&nbsp; These are
    all available in the package repositories of the recent common
    Linux distributions, though figuring out what the package names
    are can be an adventure.&nbsp; Or, you can install them from
    source .<br></li>
    <li>Download the installation tarball for the Windows/Mac
    cross-compiling environment called <a style=
    "font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.sandroid.org/imcross">I'm
    Cross!</a>&nbsp; Please use version 20090426 or later.<br></li>
    <li>In an empty directory (which for the sake of argument I'll
    call ~/Projects), unpack the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross</span> tarball.&nbsp; This will
    give you a directory called ~/Projects/IMCROSS/.</li>
    <li>Within ~/Projects/IMCROSS/ create a text file called
    Makefile.override-settings containing the following line:&nbsp;
    "NO_SDL=".<br></li>
    <li>Install <span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span>
    using the instructions on the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> website, noting in
    particular that you may have to install some additional
    software to insure that the Mac OS X tools and libraries are
    installed.&nbsp; However, do not customize the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> installation, since
    Virtual AGC is designed to accept the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> defaults.&nbsp; This is
    the part that takes a long time, and a lot of bandwidth and
    disk space.&nbsp; The good news is that you can walk away from
    it and let it do its job unattended.<br></li>
    <li>Unpack the Virtual AGC development snapshot
    (yaAGC-dev-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2) someplace.</li>
    <li>Browse to the web to download the <a style=
    "font-weight: bold;" href=
    "http://software.jessies.org/terminator/">Terminator</a> dmg
    file.&nbsp; In theory you may be able to 'mount' this in Linux,
    but I simply opened it in Mac OS X.&nbsp; Inside, you'll find
    an application called "Terminator", which (considering the way
    Mac OS X works) is actually a folder called
    "Terminator.app".&nbsp; Make a tarball from this ("tar -cjvf
    Terminator.app.tar.bz2 Terminator.app"), and copy
    Terminator.app.bz2 to the parent directory on your Linux box
    where you unpacked the Virtual AGC development snapshot.&nbsp;
    (In other words, Terminator.app.tar.bz2 and yaAGC/ should be in
    the same directory.)<br></li>
    <li>Back on Linux again, 'cd' into the yaAGC/ directory created
    by unpacking the tarball.</li>
    <li>Do "make all-archs".</li>
    <li>In the directory yaAGC/VirtualAGC/, you'll find the
    binary-installation packages for Linux (<span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-installer</span>), Windows
    (<span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-setup.exe</span>),
    and Mac OS X (<span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC.app.tar.gz</span>).</li>
  </ol>The Windows/Mac binary packages you get this way are
  equivalent if not necessarily byte-for-byte identical to the ones
  I distribute.&nbsp; However, the Linux binary package will be
  very different, and do not be fooled into thinking that it is as
  portable as the one I provide.&nbsp; Very likely, it would work
  on only a very restricted range of Linux boxes.&nbsp; The reason
  for this is that I've gone out of my way to create a very generic
  Linux system (with static as opposed to shared libraries to the
  extent possible) on which I build the distribution Linux
  installer for Virtual AGC.&nbsp; If you want to know how to do
  <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>, <a href=
  "http://www.sandroid.org/imcross#LinuxCrossProblems">the
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> website
  provides instructions</a>.&nbsp; It's considerably <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">more</span> time-consuming to set up than a
  standard <span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> setup
  is.<br>
  <h2><a name="Running_the_Validation_Suite" id=
  "Running_the_Validation_Suite"></a>Running the Validation Suite
  of the simulated AGC<br></h2>Having installed the software as
  above, you can test the emulated CPU and DSKY using the

  <ol>
    <li>Run the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    program, select "Validation suite" as the simulation type, and
    hit the "Run" button.</li>
    <li>A code of "00" will appear in the PROG area of the DSKY,
    and the OPR ERR lamp will flash.&nbsp; This means that the
    validation program is ready to start.<br></li>
    <li>Press the PRO key on the DSKY.&nbsp; The OPR ERR light will
    go off and the validation program will begin.<br></li>
    <li>There is no indication that the test is running.&nbsp; The
    test takes about 77 seconds.</li>
    <li>If all tests are passed, then the PROG area on the DSKY
    will show the code "77", and the OPR ERR lamp will flash.&nbsp;
    (The return code is 77 because 77 is the largest 2-digit octal
    number.&nbsp; It is just a coincidence that the test duration
    is also 77 seconds.)<br></li>
    <li>If some tests fail, an error code other than "00" or "77"
    will be displayed in the PROG area on the DSKY, and the OPR ERR
    lamp will flash.</li>

  <h2><a name="Some_platform-specific_odditities" id=
  "Some_platform-specific_odditities"></a>Some platform-specific
  oddities</h2>Here are some strange things I noted when testing
  out the downloadable binary-installation packages on various
  target platforms.&nbsp; I can't say whether these quirks would
  continue to exist if Virtual AGC was built from source.&nbsp; Nor
  do I claim to have done a 100% test of all Virtual AGC features
  on each platform, since Virtual AGC is a pretty large and complex
  set of programs; in particular, I do not claim to have tested
  joystick operation with any thoroughness.&nbsp; But if you have
  difficulties, you may or may not find some help for them
  below.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Very slow machines.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>You may find that the simulation uses &gt;100% of the
      available CPU, particularly if the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span>-based <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> component is being
      used.&nbsp; I fear that the only workaround for this at
      present is to turn off the interfaces of the simulation which
      you don't need.</li>
      <li>You may find that the simulation (and particularly
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>) aborts
      at startup, possibly with a pop-up box indicating that there
      is a failure to connect to <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp; This problem is
      caused by the time needed to start the various program
      components.&nbsp; You can introduce extra delay before these
      checks are performed by editing a pair of files in the
      installation directory (by default, ~/VirtualAGC/Resources in
      Linux, c:\Program Files\Virtual AGC\Resources in Windows, or
      ~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources in Mac OS
      X).&nbsp; In the file SimStop, change "sleep 5" to "sleep
      30".&nbsp; In the file VirtualAGC.tcl, change "after 5000" to
      "after 30000".&nbsp; These change some 5-second delays to 30
      seconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Networking must be properly configured, even though Virtual
    AGC does not by default communicate with other computers,
    because Virtual AGC uses TCP ports which Virtual AGC uses to
    interconnect the various bits and pieces of the
    simulation.&nbsp; So if you don't have a network card or
    wireless, it may be difficult to get Virtual AGC to work.&nbsp;
    Specifically:<br></li>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have SE Linux (or I guess, the equivalent security
      features in Windows/Mac OS X) enabled, it may block Virtual
      AGC from using networking as being an untrusted
      application.&nbsp; (I believe that most modern Linux
      distributions, such as Fedora, enable SE Linux functionality
      by default.)&nbsp; Personally, I have no need for SE Linux ,
      so I always just completely disable it, and hence I can't
      give you much additional insight into <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">details</span> about reconfiguring it,
      but I presume there's some way to identify the bits and
      pieces of Virtual AGC (namely VirtualAGC, yaAGC, yaAGS,
      yaDSKY2, yaDEDA2, yaTelemetry, and Tcl/Tk) as being trusted
      applications.</li>
      <li>If you have a personal firewall software enabled, it may
      block the TCP ports which Virtual AGC uses.&nbsp; The ports
      in question are (by default) 19697-19706, 19797-19806, and
      19897-19906.&nbsp; I generally just disable personal
      firewalls on my computers since I'm always behind a physical
      firewall anyway, but usually there's some sort of a GUI
      configuration program you can run to open holes in the
      firewall for specific TCP ports.</li>
      <li>By default, it is generally possible when making network
      connection to refer to a computer either by the host name you
      assign it when you install the operating system, or by the
      default name "localhost".&nbsp; Virtual AGC uses the
      latter.&nbsp; I am told that there are some conditions,
      possibly having to do with the use of wireless (though the
      problem has been reported to me as a problem with the Network
      Manager on Fedora 11 Linux), in which the computer cannot be
      accessed using the default name "localhost".&nbsp; Hence
      Virtual AGC fails.&nbsp; In Linux, this can be gotten around
      by adding the line "127.0.0.1 localhost" in the file
      /etc/hosts.&nbsp; (If the line "127.0.0.1 <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">something</span>" already exists, then
      just add "localhost" to the end of it.)&nbsp; I presume that
      you can diagnose both the problem and verify the fix by
      trying "ping localhost" from a command line.&nbsp; Thanks to
      Onno Hommes for pointing out this problem and the fix for
      it.<br></li>

      <li>Fedora Core 1—the <span style=

      <li>Fedora 10, 32-bit—some odd fonts and odd positioning of

      unusable.&nbsp; Fedora 10 is extremely odd in that it does
      not install <span style="font-weight: bold;">xterm</span> by
      default, and if you don't install it yourself you'll find
      that a number of <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> features don't
      work.&nbsp; (Thanks to Onno Hommes for noticing this!)&nbsp;
      I also have a report that the joystick configurator does not
      work properly even when <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">xterm</span> is added, but it worked for
      me.<br></li>

      <li>OpenSUSE 10.1, 32-bit—no oddities noted.</li>
      <li>OpenSUSE 11.1, 32-bit—the KDE 4 desktop system refused to
      admit that the installer program (<span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-installer</span>) was an
      executable program, so it was necessary to run the installer
      from the command-line rather than by clicking on its desktop
      icon.&nbsp; Moreover, the installer could not be run unless a
      software package called "itcl" (which is present on the
      OpenSUSE distribution disk) was installed.&nbsp; Fortunately,
      the installer ran normally, and the KDE 4 desktop did
      recognize <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
      itself as an executable program after installation.&nbsp;
      Positioning of text in some of the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> screens was somewhat
      unusual, but not unusable.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Windows, installed from binary package</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows 95, 98—<span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> is unusable on Windows
      95 or 98, even if it could be built from source there.&nbsp;
      The reason is that none of the batch files created by Virtual
      AGC are compatible with the command shell in Windows 95 or
      98.&nbsp; It is possible that individual programs like
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span> may be usable there if
      controlled from the command line rather than from the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI, but I
      no longer have any means of verifying or denying this.</li>
      <li>Windows 2000—unknown.</li>
      <li>Windows XP—</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows will sometimes (but not always) pop up a
        warning window asking whether it should "block" or
        "unblock" <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>—presumably
        because they are servers and therefore might do Very Bad
        Things to your computer.&nbsp; I think the only thing the
        "block" does is to prevent network access via a firewall,
        and since usually all of your Virtual AGC servers and
        clients are running on the same computer anyway, it doesn't
        really matter whether you block or unblock: it seems to
        work fine either way.<br></li>
        <li>Some of the programs (such as the telemetry monitor)
        may not always be closable from the
        operating-system-supplied controls around the border of the
        windows.&nbsp; However, they will close down normally if
        (for example) you close the DSKY.</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
        program is unusable, because if its window loses focus it
        is unable to access the joystick thereafter.</li>
        <li>Windows always displays a message when <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> shuts down that it has
        experienced "a problem" and asks whether or not you want
        Microsoft informed.&nbsp; Well, I don't know why the
        message appears, but <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> seems to work well
        enough for our purposes.&nbsp; Neverthless, if the message
        annoys you, you should use the default <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> anyway (assuming that it
        works for you).<br></li>
        <li>The main GUI programs (<span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span>, <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA2</span>, <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>) don't seem to
        produce any console output, so if you run them from a
        command line—say, "yaDSKY2 --help"—you won't see any
        messages.&nbsp; I believe that you may still be able to see
        something if you pipe the output into a file—as, for
        example, "yaDSKY2 --help &gt;temp.txt".</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
        for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
        program displays no prompt, but otherwise seems to work
        properly.</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
        for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
        program sometimes displays garbage characters upon pressing
        keys at startup.&nbsp; However, the commands being entered
        by the keystrokes are interpreted correctly and after
        executing a command or two it settles down and works
        properly.<br></li>
        <li>If using the command-line debug modes for <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> or <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, their terminal windows
        will not close automatically when the other windows close,
        nor will <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> be
        halted.&nbsp; You'll have to close those windows
        manually.<br></li>

      <li><a name="VistaQuirks" id="VistaQuirks"></a>Windows Vista
      and Windows 7—I do not have dedicated Windows Vista or
      Windows 7 machines on which to perform testing.&nbsp;
      However, because of the continued complaints I've received
      about Vista, I have been able to do some limited testing with
      Windows Vista Home Basic and with the Windows 7 Release
      Candidate.&nbsp; Additionally, I have received some notes on
      this subject from users of my <a href=
      "http://www.sandroid.org/GutenMark">Project Gutenberg
      Prettifier, <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">GutenMark</span></a>, whose programs are
      constructed using techniques similar to Virtual AGC.&nbsp; So
      here are some things that may or may not be useful to
      note:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Jim Adcock (thanks, Jim!) sent word that it was
        necessary to change the properties of all of&nbsp; the .exe
        files in the bin/ sub-directory of the installation
        directory (by default, "c:\Program files\VirtualAGC\bin')
        to "Run as Administrator".&nbsp; I personally did not find
        it necessary to do this for Virtual AGC.<br></li>
        <li>A user identified only as "Wendl" (thanks, Wendl!) sent
        word that it was additionally necessary to change the
        properties of the .exe files to select compatibility with
        XP Service Pack 2.&nbsp; I personally did not find it
        necessary to do this for Virtual AGC.</li>
        <li>Brendan O'Rourke (thanks Brendan!) has pointed out that
        an error "Cannot create file simulation.bat" occurs when
        trying to run the simulation.&nbsp; I have found that this
        may&nbsp; not happen at first, but may begin happening
        after Windows is shut down and then restarted again
        later.&nbsp; The problem appears to be that Windows is not
        consistent in the permissions you are given, so you are
        fooled into thinking that Virtual AGC works, but only later
        find that you don't have the proper permissions to run
        it.&nbsp; Here is the fix:</li>

        </ol>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>File dialogs may not open to the proper folders.&nbsp;
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">For example,
        in trying to select a source-code file to assemble, I've
        found that the file dialog opens at Resources\scenarios,
        whereas it is supposed to open at
        Resources\source.</span></li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The
        command-line debug modes for</span> <span style=
        "font-weight: bold; text-decoration: line-through;">yaAGC</span>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and</span>
        <span style=
        "font-weight: bold; text-decoration: line-through;">yaAGS</span>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">may sometimes
        display garbage at first when you type at the keyboard,
        though eventually starts properly displaying
        keystrokes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, unlike other versions of
        Windows in which this is merely an annoyance, in Vista/Win
        7 it may instead cause the simulation to abort.&nbsp; I've
        had pretty good luck working around this by hitting a few
        carriage returns before typing in the first actual
        debugging command.</span><br></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Windows, natively built from source</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
      joystick-handler program cannot display the joystick
      readings, and therefore is hard to configure using the
      "Handler" functionality.&nbsp; (Also, after trying to
      configure it with "Handler", it remains running rather then
      being closed down, and you have to manually terminate it by
      using ctrl-alt-delete to bring up a process list.)&nbsp; In
      spite of these quirks, it does actually work properly when
      running a simulation.</li>
      <li>AGC/AGS program listings may or may not align at the
      proper tab-stop positions when viewed in a browser.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Mac OS X, installed from binary package<br></li>
    <ul>
      <li>All—Mac OS X insists on opening all of the windows (DSKY,
      DEDA, telemetry monitor, etc.) exactly atop each other, so
      that on each run you have to manally move the windows around
      in order to see them.</li>
      <li>10.2 and prior—the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> binary distribution is
      unusable on these platforms.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>10.3.9 and 10.4.11 (PowerPC)—</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The IMU (<span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>) does not seem to
        respond to the hand-controller (<span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>), even though both of
        them appear to work individually.&nbsp; This may have
        something to do with the fact that the iMac I'm running it
        on is old and very slow.&nbsp; (The simulation takes
        &gt;100% of the CPU time.)</li>
        <li>The AGS/DEDA pair of programs seems to intermittently
        freeze up and require rebooting.&nbsp; I suspect that this
        is because on the old 400 MHz G3 I'm using the CPU loading
        is at 300%, and there are some timing requirements on
        AGS/DEDA communications that aren't being met.&nbsp; But
        I'm not sure, and it could be a different bug.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>10.3.9 (PowerPC)—</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The file-save and file-open dialogs for core-dump saves
        and opens, and for Digital Uplink, refuse to navigate to
        the proper directory (by default,
        ~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources/scenarios/); it
        may be advisable to copy or link this directory to the
        Desktop or some other accessible location if you wish to
        use these features.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Can't run <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
        or <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in --debug
        mode from <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.<br></li>
      </ul>
      <li>10.5.6 (Intel)—In spite of my best efforts, I've seen
      instances in which <a href=
      "yaTelemetry.html#LM_Simulator_by_Stephan_Hotto">the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> portion
      of the simulation suite</a> does not shut down when the
      remainder of the simulation shuts down, and needs to be
      terminated manually from its menu.</li>
      <li>Even on my fastest box (which is a Core Duo Mac Mini),
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> runs at
      fractional speed, and is therefore useless (whilst the
      remainder of Virtual AGC proper is running fine at full
      speed).&nbsp; I suspect an incompatibility in <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span>.</li>
      <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
      for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> program
      displays no prompt, but otherwise seems to work
      properly.</li>
      <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
      for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> program
      sometimes displays garbage characters upon pressing keys at
      startup.&nbsp; However, the commands being entered by the
      keystrokes are interpreted correctly and after executing a
      command or two it settles down and works properly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Mac OS X, built natively from source</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Retro" display mode of the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> program may not
      work.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <li>FreeBSD, natively built from source.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For joystick handling, <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> works, but <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> and <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> do not.</li>
      <li>There is some unusual horizontal positioning in some text
      which is supposed to be centered.</li>
      <li>The crossed-out sub-items are observations of problems
      which I no longer observe.<br></li>
      <ul>
        <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">When running
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in
        command-line debug mode, there is no command-line prompt,
        except that one appears sometimes <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">after</span> hitting the
        carriage-return.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it seems to work
        properly otherwise.</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Source browsing
        does not seem to work from <span style=
        "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, because the paths
        to the html files (which exist!) aren't constructed
        properly.</li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nor does
        assembly of source code from</span> <span style=
        "font-weight: bold; text-decoration: line-through;">VirtualAGC</span>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work,
        presumably for the same reason (badly-constructed
        paths).</span><br></li>
      </ul>
      <li>What success I had was with PC-BSD 7.1.&nbsp; I was
      previously able to build on PC-BSD 7.02, but have not had a
      working setup for a while to see if it still works in
      7.02.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Solaris.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Only OpenSolaris 0811 has been tried.</li>
      <li>There is some unusual horizontal positioning in some text
      which is supposed to be centered.</li>
      <li>No joystick-handler program is available.&nbsp;
      (<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> doesn't
      build, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> build but
      don't work ... at least for me.)</li>
      <li>Redrawing of graphical objects seems intermittent.&nbsp;
      For example, some digits on the DSKY might get updated, and
      others might not.</li>
      <li>The telemetry-display program never displays any
      telemetry.</li>
      <li>In command-line debug mode, <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> spontaneously abort and end
      the simulation.</li>
      <li>Sometimes there is a spurious i/o command; for example,
      when running the "validation" program on the AGC, the it
      often seems as if it starts out with the PRO key
      pressed.<br></li>
      <li>It appears to me that several of these phenomena may be
      due to data being lost or otherwise corrupted in the socket
      system; perhaps some of the socket uptions I'm using aren't
      as portable as I imagined.</li>
      <li>Assembly doesn't work from within the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> environment.&nbsp; I
      suspect that the file-open dialogs in Solaris may cause the
      current working directory to change in ways I haven't been
      anticipating.</li>
