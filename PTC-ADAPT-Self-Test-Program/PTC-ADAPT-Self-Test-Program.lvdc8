# Documentation:http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf,
#		particularly Chapter 7 ("Calibration"), from which the page scans and
#		executable (assembled octals) mentioned above were taken.  Figure 7-12 
#		is this complete software in flowchart form.  The web page linked above
#		also covers known errors in the documentation.
# Mod history:  2020-04-12 RSB  Began transcribing from page images.
#		2020-04-21 RSB	Finished transcribing, rough draft.  
#				Haven't done any proofing yet.
#		2020-04-29 RSB	Now assembles 100% error/warning free,
#				and the assembled octals agree with 
#				those from the transcribed octal file.
#				Some workarounds were necessary in the
#				source code.  I have not proofed the
#				comments, so perhaps some errors remain
#				there.
#		2023-05-24 RSB	Changed extension to .lvdc8 from .lvdc and 
#				added the build instructions to the comments
#				above.
#
# At this writing (2020-04-29), there are some behaviors (or bugs) in
# the original assembler which so far have not been duplicated in the 
# modern assembler.  A small number of workarounds (search for the 
# comment "workaround") have been added to the source code to insure 
# that the assembly remains octal-for-octal identical to the original.  
# These are all ORG/DOG pseudo-ops or extra TRA instructions.  Hopefully 
# these can be removed at some point if the assembler is updated.  The 
# assembler's command-line switch --past-bugs determines whether or not 
# the assembler attempts to mimic those original bugs.  For example, in 
# the assembly listing printout, the original assembler printed incorrect 
# information for the BCI pseudo-op (although it assembled correct octals 
# for it); the modern assembler by default prints correct information on 
# the listing, but reverts to printing the original incorrect information
# if --past-bugs is used.
#
# Regarding the BCI pseudo-op:  In the original assembly language, BCI's
# operands were terminated by $ character.  In the modern assembly 
# language, the operands are additionally initiated by ^ characters not
# present in the original assembly language.  This is due to a requirement
# of the modern assembler (yaASM.py) to relax strict columnar alignment of
# the source code.  Thus what would have been "BCI string$" originally
# is "BCI ^string$" in this source file used with the modern assembler.
#
# White space (blank lines and spaces within lines) in this transcript
# are not necessarily the same as for the original punch cards.  
# Specifically, for convenience in working with modern text-editor
# software, I've put the operator and operand fields at 
# 8-position tab stops, namely columns 9 and 17, and trailing comments
# usually at column 41.  (You need to have tabs configured to 8 to
# view this file properly aligned.)  None of which would agree with the 
# original punch cards.  A convenient set of tab stops to duplicate
# what appears in the original program listing would have the first 
# two fields combining to fill 15 characters (at widths of 7 and 8 
# columns respectively), and all subsequent tab stops at 5-column 
# intervals.  Unfortunately, text editors that can duplicate an uneven
# set of tab stops like that aren't too common, thus I've pragmatically
# opted for default uniform 8-column tab stops adopted by most modern 
# text-editing programs.
#
# On the other hand, I've attempted to preserve the spaces 
# _within_ the 1965 program comments, except where those
# comments are obviously intended to align with inline comments
# suffixed to lines of code. In this transcription, as in the 
# original, full-line comments are prefixed by '*' in column 1.
# As in the original, inline comments trailing code on the same line 
# are not marked by any special leading character.
#
# In contrast, comments added later (in 2020 or later) that are not present
# in the original printout at all are instead prefixed by '#' in column 1.
#
# In the original printout, almost all lines have a SEQUENCE number at the
# end, reflecting corresponding numbers on the punch cards.  Those SEQUENCE
# numbers are _not_ preserved here on a line-by-line basis, but I've added
# a comment for each PAGE change that appeared in the original printout, 
# and those PAGE-change comments do list the range of SEQUENCE numbers 
# found on the corresponding PAGE of the printout.
#
# Regarding the PAGE numbers:  The original assembly listing presumably had
# page numbers at the top, generated by the assembler, but the listing
# which has come down to us is not that original printout.  Rather, it was
# embedded in a document, "SATURN V Laboratory Maintenance Instruction
# for LTE", Volume V, "Programmable Test Controller", Figure 7-13.
# (http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf,
# beginning at PDF page 434, marked "V-7-250".)  In that document, 
# the headings that were presumably at the tops of the pages
# have been removed, so there are no assembler-generated page numbers.
# Instead, the figure captions from the document, list a "sheet" number
# for each page, and those sheet numbers have been used here as the PAGE
# numbers.

# This is the entry point for the program at power-up.  
# Note that there's already a bug ... or at least an
# element of unnecessary confusion!  Because of the 
# preceding ORG statement on page 5, the assembler
# believes that the current data sector is 0-13, and 
# it will therefore look in that memory sector when it
# accesses variables.  On the other hand, the CPU has 
# no way of knowing at runtime what the assembler 
# believes, and will instead believe that the current 
# data sector is 0-00.  Perhaps by design, however,
# the initial instructions of the program access variables
# (ZERO, INTIND, STOP, CTR, LC8) that are in residual
# memory, and thus are accessible regardless of 
# whether the assembler and the CPU agree as to which
# memory sector is currently selected.  The 6th
# instruction executed, "CDS 1,13" puts the assembler
# and CPU into agreement for subsequently-encountered
# variables. -- RSB 2020

# The following line appears in the original assembly listing,
# but was generated by the assembler rather than being source
# code.  It is thus commented-out here.  However, I've been
# unable to figure out how to get the assembler to automatically
# generate the necessary transfer and insert it here.  So
# the two lines following the comment have been added to this
# source file to produce the necessary effect.  They should be
# removed after I figure how to reproduce the correct behavior
# directly within the assembler.

*	ERROR ROUTINE
# The 50-word table at ERR (see paragraph 7-34 of the PTC
# documentation) can store up to 10 errors, as 5-word blocks.  
# The first error encountered is stored at ERR through ERR+4,  
# the second at ERR+5 through ERR+9, and so on.  This is 
# self-modifying code.  You'll notice that as written, the STO
# instructions (at L95P7 and at L95P2-L95P5) put data into the
# error table at ERR through ERR+4, but farther down in the code 
# (at L96P1) all of these STO's are overwritten with different 
# STO instructions operating 5 words higher in the ERR table. 
# At the 11th error (there is no test in the code for overflowing
# the end of the ERR table!), the modified code then at L95P7 
# will overwrite the instruction L95P7+1 with ERR-table data, 
# and the program will probably crash. -- RSB 2020.
