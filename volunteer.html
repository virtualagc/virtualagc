    <p>This current opportunity has now come to an end, so you've lost
      out, alas!&nbsp; However, I'm so in love with my own words that
      I'll let the description persist for a while, and you can read it
      below.&nbsp; With luck, more such opportunities may present
      themselves in the future.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Scan, Baby, Scan!<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Most of this web-page covers things you can do to help in a very
      general way, but it so happens that <i>right now</i> there is a
      very specific way in which we'd like to get your help.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Right now, a very large (by our standards) set of very rare
      AGC-related material has become available to us from the personal
      keepsakes of Hugh Blair-Smith and Don Eyles, who were among the
      original developers of the AGC.&nbsp; Some of you may recall Don
      Eyles as the hero programmer of Apollo 14.&nbsp; That story has
      been told and retold many places on the web, so I won't repeat it
      here, but for example, there's <a
href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/extra-weird-looking-freak-saves-apollo-14-19710318">
        a Rolling Stone article about it</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To acquire this material and present it here online, however, it
      must be scanned, and scanning costs money, and that's where we'd
      like your help.<br>
    </p>
    <p>No, don't send us money, please!&nbsp; The materials will be
      scanned by <a href="http://www.archive.org">archive.org</a>, and
      anybody who is kind enough to help out will be billed directly by
      archive.org after the scanning takes place.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What we are looking for, for each one of the documents we need to
      scan, is a "sponsor" who will commit to paying for that
      scanning.&nbsp; So what we'd like for you to do is to choose which
      particular document you'd like to sponsor, from the list in the
      next section, and to drop me an email (Ron Burkey
      &lt;info@sandroid.org&gt;) with your name, physical address, and
      telephone number.&nbsp; If two or more people want the same
      document, the first email I receive wins it, so if you have a
      second choice, include that in the email.&nbsp; I'll fill out the
      paperwork for archive.org, and we'll keep you apprised of the
      progress.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The amount you can expect to pay is $3 plus $0.25/page, so the
      list in the next section includes page counts to help you figure
      out the total.&nbsp; If you are not in the U.S., that is fine with
      archive.org as long as your email address is valid.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>The Document List</h2>
    <p>Here's the list of documents we are trying to acquire.&nbsp;
      You'll notice that some of them already have sponsors, and indeed,
      some of them have already been scanned.&nbsp; Don't choose one of
      those.&nbsp; Incidentally, after the documents are scanned,
      archive.org will continue to host them online at quite a high
      resolution, and you can examine <a
        href="http://archive.org/details/virtualagcproject">our Virtual
        AGC "collection" of documents at archive.org</a> to better
      understand what you're helping to accomplish.<br>

            This is, in principle, something we've already had for many
            years, and is already online many places on the web,
            including at this site.&nbsp; However, the version which has
            been available these many years was <i>digitally mutilated
              by an OCR process</i> and the original high-quality scans
            discarded.&nbsp; Consequently, the available scans are
            barely readable.&nbsp; This would be a new, clean,
            unmutilated scan.&nbsp; A similar thing happened with the
            Colossus 249 (Apollo 9 Command Module) scans that have been
            available in mutilated form for many years:&nbsp; they were
            eventually replaced by a clean, legible scan.&nbsp; That's
            actually a factor, because our current tools for
            proofing/correcting program comments (which tend to have
            thousands of errors in any given program version if merely
            proof-read in a normal fashion by people) depend on a nice,
            clean scan, and thus our existing transcription of Luminary
            131 source code is bound to be riddled with them!<br>

          <td valign="top">Don Eyles offers this explanation:&nbsp;
            "ZERLINA was my personal non-flight testbed for developing
            new capabilities, some of which later moved to the main line
            LUMINARY. Its main feature was a new version of the Servicer
            job in which the guidance period was allowed to stretch
            beyond the nominal 2 seconds — part of the overall effort in
            response to the CPU overload on 11. Variable Servicer would
            have been necessary if new capability was required that
            would have further reduced our CPU margin, such as something
            called P66 LPD, also implemented in ZERLINA, based on an
            idea of John Young's, that would have facilitated making
            very accurate landings. This capability is described in
            Draper Lab report E-2581, which I can at some point make
            available. Neither Variable Servicer nor P66 LPD was ever
            approved for LUMINARY. Things developed first in ZERLINA
            that DID make the jump to LUMINARY included the a priori
            terrain model (needed to land in more mountainous terrain),
            and also a new version of the "landing analog displays," the
            same mentioned in the Tindallgram of July 24, 1970. In my
            view ZERLINA 56 still represents the state of the art for
            manned landings on the Moon."&nbsp; Paul Fjeld has also told
            me, although Don doesn't mention it, that John Young also
            worked with this in the LM simulator.<br>

            By the way, <a href="Documents/LUMINARY-memo-138.pdf">
              LUMINARY Memo #138</a> describes what Don was doing with
            the Variable Servicer, which (among other things) eliminated
            the infamous 1201 and 1202 alarms.&nbsp; At the very least,
            the memo is a very funny read, and very short.<br>

            Now, we already have a digitized version of LUMINARY 99 from
            the MIT Museum, so why do we need another one?&nbsp; Well,
            while I can't claim dire necessity, I'll point out that:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>This would be a higher-quality digitization than our
                previous one.</li>
              <li>That it would have whatever hand-written notes Don
                Eyles had chosen to scrawl in it.</li>
              <li>That a page or so was actually missing from our
                original copy, and this printout has that
                material.&nbsp; (Though, admittedly, we had already
                reconstructed it long ago from LUMINARY 131, and that
                Don has since sent us snapshots of the relevant pages,
                and it turns out to be 100% identical with what we had
                already reconstructed.)</li>
              <li>We will probably be able to use it to get rid of a few
                typos in our existing transcription of Luminary 99 that
                continue to linger even though considerable effort has
                been put into eliminating them in recent months.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The printout is interesting, in that rather than being
              called LMY99 BY NASA as our 1969 version is, it is called
              AP11ROPE BY EYLES and is from late 1970.&nbsp; However, we
              already know that the memory-bank checksums are identical,
              so there's every reason to believe (though no guarantee)
              that the entire contents are identical as well.&nbsp; I'm
              not quite sure why Don has it, but my guess is that it's
              the companion to the 1971 digital simulation listed above;
              I suspect that Don wanted compare the behavior of ZERLINA
              to the Apollo 11 baseline, since some of the changes
              test-bedded in ZERLINA were targeted at eliminating the
              CPU overloads which triggered the infamous 1201 and 1202

          run itself. The printout includes astronaut inputs, DSKY
          displays, lines called "clocks" that are printed when the code
          passes through certain locations, and for every two seconds of
          simulated time a three-line summary of data from the
          simulation environment including the current position,
          velocity, attitude, etc., etc. The edit portion includes
          additional sim and AGC data, also printed at two-second

    <h2>What's In It For Me (by which I mean <i>you</i>)?</h2>
    <p>Well, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you did a good
      thing, and your name will be permanently enshrined as a sponsor
      (assuming you want it to be so enshrined) both at this website,
      and in our archive.org collection!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Not enough for you?&nbsp; Well, to express my thanks, if you
      sponsor the scanning of one of these documents, I'll personally
      buy you a thank-you gift, as follows:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sponsor a document of 100 or more pages:&nbsp; you get an
        Apollo coffee mug.</li>
      <li>Sponsor a document of 500 or more pages:&nbsp; you get an
        Apollo ball cap.</li>
      <li>Sponsor a document of 1000 or more pages:&nbsp; you get an
        Apollo tee shirt.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And so as to be fair, if you sponsor multiple smaller documents,
      you can add the pages counts together to go to the next higher
      gift category, if you like.&nbsp; Or if you offered to sponsor a
      larger document and it had become unavailable so that you had to
      accept your second choice, which was smaller, it was your original
      good intention that determines your gift category.&nbsp; Of
      course, you can optionally choose a lower gift category, or no
      gift at all (that works for me!).<br>
    </p>
    <p>After the scans are complete, and you've paid archive.org, I'll
      get you the exact details and get your choices (style, size,
      color, etc.), but you'll have a choice of some reasonable

    <h2>I Don't Want to Pay, But I Still Want to Help (again, <i>you</i>)!</h2>
    <p>Well, as you may be aware, what <i>we</i> do with AGC software
      that comes to us in the form of program listings or scanned
      program listings is to<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Transcribe the source code into the form of files which can be
        "assembled" to create an executable memory "rope".</li>
      <li>Provide the source-code files and the "rope" to the public, so
        that the program can be run in an AGC simulator.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We talk more about how to do that below, but there are no
      "gimmes" associated with it, sorry!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Okay, so that's the end of the special offer.&nbsp; If you want
      to continue reading the general description of what we need, then
      by all means proceed to the next section!<br>
    </p>
    <h1><a name="Information" id="Information"></a>Information </h1>
    First and foremost, Virtual AGC is about providing AGC/AGS related
    documentation that cannot (or at least, previously could not) be
    found elsewhere online.&nbsp; Examples of items that will always be
    in demand are these:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Legible scans or page-by-page digital photographs of <span
          style="font-style: italic;">assembly listings</span> for any
        Apollo software versions not already on this site.&nbsp; These
        do not have to be listings from actual missions, and could be
        intermediate versions.&nbsp; By an "assembly listing", I mean a
        printout showing assembly-language source code and the binary to
        which that source code reduces upon assembly.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Scans of any original Apollo documents not already available <a
          href="links.html">here at Virtual AGC</a> or elsewhere. &nbsp;
        Of particular value would be software patches applied at
        runtime, software problems reports, mission checklists, and
        detailed technical documentation of hardware interfaced to the
        AGC.&nbsp; <a href="QuestForInfo.html">Click here for hints of
          where to find such documentation</a>.</li>
      <li>Or even <span style="font-style: italic;">information</span>
        about where such material resides, such as "Museum XYZ has a
        listing of Luminary 1D".<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    If you have such material, you'll probably want to contact me
    directly to determine that we don't already have that item in
    process, to discuss methods of preparation, to discuss means of
    delivery to me, etc.&nbsp; These days, what we prefer to do is to
    have the item scanned at some local outpost of archive.org; but
    there are only a handful of these around the country (Boston,
    Washington, and so on), so it's not always applicable.&nbsp; There's
    also a pretty-complete description of all the other available
    options on our <a href="HowToDigitize.html">"how to digitize" page</a>.&nbsp;









    When you contact me, a page or two of scanned or
    digitally-photographed images (including the title page) attached to
    the email might be useful.<br>
    <br>
    <h1><a name="Wiki" id="Wiki"></a>Wiki</h1>
    If you have AGC/AGS information other than original Apollo documents
    you'd like to make publicly available, you could do so by contacting
    me directly.&nbsp; But in some cases you may find a better and more
    straightforward approach may be to <a
      href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/wiki">contribute
      your knowledge to the wiki</a>.&nbsp; Examples of things that are
    useful are theoretical discussions, historical information or
    anecdotes, tutorials on how to perform certain tasks with the AGC or
    AGS, etc.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <h1><a name="Coding" id="Coding"></a>Coding</h1>
    If you have a simple bug-fix, it might be easiest to submit a patch
    directly to me.&nbsp; Please be sure to tell me when you do so which
    development snapshot or which subversion revision you started from.<br>
    <br>
    For more extensive coding, we have a <a
      href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc">code repository
      at GitHub</a> and if you have ideas for new features then you can
    contribute them to the project via the repository.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Some particular sore spots which could be addressed by an ambitious
    coder include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
        program so that it can interpret downlink telemetry streams
        emitted from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
        program in order to update LM state vectors.</li>
      <li>Fixing <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> so that
        its downlink telemetry streams work.</li>
      <li>Fixing <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>
        (or providing a supplemental program) to display <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> downlink telemetry.</li>
      <li>Adding an IMU simulation program.</li>
      <li>Adding an FDAI simulation program.</li>
      <li>Adding an AOT simulation program.</li>
      <li>Working out the details of using the hand-controller
        simulations (<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>) and/or IMU in the
        Command Module.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Adding simulated peripheral devices for the AGS.</li>
      <li>Addition of more control-panel visual realism.&nbsp; (For
        example, control panels that look like control panels, with
        switches that look like switches, in proper locations, rather
        switches that look like GUI push-button widgets, located
        wherever is convenient.)</li>
      <li>Integrating Virtual AGC into an existing open-source
        spacecraft simulator program.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    While the excellent <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
    contributed program by Stephan Hotto already provides a simulated
    IMU and FDAI, it has a couple of drawbacks in that it is written in
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> interpreted
    language, and that it is closely tailored to the LM (making it only
    of limited value for the CM).&nbsp; The fact that it is in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> makes it relatively slow,
    and almost unusable on slower computers.&nbsp; Of course, as time
    goes on and computers become faster and faster, this becomes less of
    a concern.&nbsp; The unusability with the CM will remain a
    concern.&nbsp; One possibility is to simply update <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> itself.&nbsp;
    Another is to convert it to C/C++.&nbsp; Still another is to replace
    it with IMU/FDAI workalikes.&nbsp; Any such effort, other than the
    latter, would preferably be coordinated with Stephan rather than
    being done unilaterally without his knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    More generally, while we will likely accept any useful code that is
    supplied, you should keep the following suggested guidelines in
    mind:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>All programs are cross-platform, with the minimum acceptable
        list of supported platforms being Linux, Windows XP, and Mac OS
        X 10.4 (and later).</li>
      <li>Only open-source development tools are used.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Non-GUI programs are preferentially written in C.</li>
      <li>GUI programs are preferentially created using the <a
          href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"><span style="font-weight:
            bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> toolkit, in the C++ language.</li>
      <li>The compilers used are <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span>
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">g++</span> (or <a
          href="http://www.mingw.org"><span style="font-weight: bold;">MinGW</span></a>
        in Windows).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The code-formatting style used is the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Formatting.html#Formatting">
          GNU style</a>.&nbsp; This doesn't necessarily mean you have to
        change all of your coding habits, as there is a handy program
        called <span style="font-weight: bold;">indent</span> readily
        available on most Linux systems and Mac OS X that will reformat
        C/C++ source files into this style.&nbsp; It is also <a
          href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/indent.htm">available










          for Windows</a>.</li>
      <li>Primary code development is done in Linux, which means that
        UNIX-style line endings ("\n") are used in preference to Windows
        line endings ("\r\n") or Mac endings ("\r").&nbsp; While this is
        not a problem for <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span>,
        it may be a problem for your source-code editing software.</li>
      <li>You retain the copyright for the code you write, but you are
        expected to license it under the terms of the GNU GPL version
        2.&nbsp; The license text within the source files should quote
        the license as "GPL version 2 or later".</li>
    </ol>
    It should be noted that making choices other than these is likely to
    make inclusion of your code into Virtual AGC binary installer
    packages impractical, and that such omission is likely to greatly
    reduce the number of people actually using your code.<br>

    <br>
    A situation arises from time-to-time in which AGC assembly-listings
    have been received and require transcription into machine-readable
    form for integration into Virtual AGC.&nbsp; Such conversion tasks
    are rather overwhelming when done by a single individual, but these
    days such conversions are performed by teams of volunteers, which
    make the work much lighter.&nbsp; There is a certain pleasure
    involved in participating in such a conversion, because you can know
    that you are helping to make available for actual use code which has
    not seen the light of day for 40 years.&nbsp; So volunteer
    assistance is welcomed in these cases.<br>

    </h2>
    If there are any transcription efforts in progress, you will see

    <br>
    Code transcription is a process wherein we take the scanned or
    photographed images of a hardcopy listing of an AGC&nbsp; program,
    and convert it to source code (text files) that can be processed to
    created the executable software which runs on the simulated AGC
    CPU.&nbsp; It is not necessary to understand AGC assembly language,
    or any computer language, to do this; but if you are somewhat
    familiar already with the AGC programs, you will be awarded with
    some small thrills along the way.<br>
    <br>
    Here is a basic outline of the conversion process:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The AGC source code is divided into a sequence of well-defined
        modules (often called "log sections"), with names such as
        INTERPRETER or IMU MODE SWITCHING ROUTINES.&nbsp; As mentioned
        above, request an assignment for a specific one of these by
        using its associated GitHub "issue".&nbsp;</li>
      <li>A starting point for the transcription of your assigned module
        will already exist in the GibHub repository.&nbsp; At the very
        least it will have a file-header describing what's in the file,
        and often will appear to contain the actual code.&nbsp; You see,
        the AGC code does not change much from mission to mission, or
        from spacecraft to spacecraft.&nbsp; (For example, the software
        for Apollo 11 fairly similar to the software for Apollo 13, and
        the software for the CM is likely to be similar in many respects
        to the software for the LM.)&nbsp; Therefore, often, the
        appropriate transcription technique is to start from <span
          style="font-style: italic;">existing</span> source code from a
        different mission or spacecraft, and then to simply make
        whatever changes are needed.</li>
      <li><a href="http://ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion">Download









          or examine online the appropriate scans of the assembly
          listings</a> being converted.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Make whatever changes are necessary for the file to conform to
        the scanned assembly listing.&nbsp; If some thing it is wrong,
        fix it!&nbsp; (Don't just make a note <i>saying</i> it's
        different; we don't care that it's different; we just want it to
        be right.)&nbsp; Note certain differences between the scans and
        the textual source-code files (referring to the picture below):<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>In the scans, "comments" begin with a special character such
          as 'R' or 'P' or 'A' in the first column, or simply appear on
          the right-hand side of the page, following the actual code
          without any special marking to distinguish them.&nbsp; In the
          Virtual AGC source-code files, however, they should be
          preceded by the '#' character.</li>
        <li>In the scans, each line begins with several columns that are
          not part of the source-code itself and are instead produced by
          the action of converting the source code to binary executable
          code.&nbsp; These columns are <span style="font-style:
            italic;">omitted</span> in the source-code files being
          created.</li>
        <li>Each line of source code begins with an optional location
          label of up to 8 characters in length, followed by an optional
          machine-language "opcode", followed by one or two optional
          parameters, followed by optional "comments".&nbsp; In the
          source-code files being created, we prefer to have tab-stops
          that are 8-spaces wide, and for the optional label to begin at
          the left-hand margin, the opcode to begin at the 2nd tab stop
          (i.e., 16 spaces in), and for each of the other fields to
          begin at the next succeeding tab stop.&nbsp; It doesn't really
          matter where comments are aligned, except that it's nice if
          they all line up at the same tab stop within any given file.</li>
        <li>Each time you move from one scanned page to the next, put in
          a comment giving the page number (from the upper right-hand
          corner of the scan), such as "## Page 292".&nbsp; This helps
          you or other people when finding or fixing errors.&nbsp; Note
          this format:&nbsp; <i>two</i> #-signs, a space, "Page"
          (capitalized in precisely that fashion), another space, and
          then a number; that's all.&nbsp; If you do it differently,
          somebody else will need to correct it later, so don't.<br>
        </li>
        <li>All AGC source code uses all-capital letters.&nbsp; You may
          feel the need to add comments of your own, in order to
          describe markings on the page, to make your own explanations
          of what's going on in the code, or whatever.&nbsp; Any
          comments <i>you</i> add to the code yourself can be in
          lower-case or mixed upper/lower case to distinguish them, and
          you might want to mark them with the date or something.&nbsp;
          Indeed, you <i>should</i> add comments for any unusual
          condition, such as missing or garbled code.&nbsp; But your
          comments must follow these rules:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <i>two</i> ##-signs in front of your own comments.</li>
          <li>Align your comment at column 1 ... i.e., at the left
            margin.</li>
          <li>These ##-style comments may be plain text, but they are
            treated as simple HTML.&nbsp; What that means is that
            successive adjacent ##-style comments will by default be
            joined into a single continuous line.&nbsp; If you want
            line-breaks at specific points, use HTML &lt;br&gt; tags or
            &lt;pre&gt; tags.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Don't hesitate to ask, if you have questions ... do this by
          commenting in the GitHub issue you're working on.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Sometimes you will encounter areas in a program listing which are
      too garbled to read, or indeed simply missing entirely.&nbsp;
      Don't panic!&nbsp; Simply mark them with ##-style comments and
      continue.&nbsp; These program listings have enough redundancy and
      commonality with other versions of the program that (at least so
      far) we can always reverse-engineer them to repair such problems,
      though the techniques are too intricate to detail here.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you'll will see many
      things which are obviously wrong, and which you will be tempted to
      "fix".&nbsp; Don't do it!&nbsp; Our standard is 100% agreement
      with the original program listing, so if you "correct" (say) WTIH
      to WITH or TEH to THE, you're simply forcing somebody else to come
      back and undo your fix later.<br>
    </p>
    In the following pictures, some of the points mentioned above are
    illustrated using the first page of the SERVICER module of AGC
    program Luminary 131.&nbsp; (It is perhaps worth pointing out that
    according to the scan, this is page 852, while according to the
    converted source-code file it is page 857.&nbsp; This is because the
    Luminary 131 page images were originally supplied as a PDF file in
    which the page numbering within the PDF file did not exactly match
    the markings on the pages themselves.&nbsp; I hope to avoid this
    kind of discrepancy in future conversions.)<br>

    Make every effort to eliminate error, but take comfort in the fact
    that we have means of detecting and correcting errors, and thus you
    don't need to lose sleep about them.&nbsp; However, the more errors
    there are, the more of a pain it is to do so, so don't let that be
    an excuse for doing less than your best.<br>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="Proofing_of_comments_in_source-code"
        id="Proofing_of_comments_in_source-code"></a>Proofing of
      comments in source-code files</h2>
    After the code-conversion activities described in the preceding
    sections, we have a reasonable assurance that the program code is
    100% correct—i.e., that the AGC program will execute properly unless
    there is a bug in the AGC CPU simulator itself.&nbsp; However, we
    also have good reason to believe from past experience that the
    program comments still have many errors.&nbsp; Normally, computer
    programmers treat program comments as an afterthought, and don't
    worry too much about them as long as the code itself is
    correct.&nbsp; But when trying to understand very old code such as
    the AGC programs, the program comments are very important.&nbsp;
    Therefore, an extra effort is associated with making sure comment
    text is proof-read and corrected.<br>
    <br>
    We don't actually need any special help with this at the present
    time, but if you have any inclination to compare the comments in our
    GitHub AGC source code to the scanned program listings, please
    do!&nbsp; If you happen to find an error, note that the AGC code
    changes gradually from version to version, so the error you find may
    exist in some or all of the other AGC versions as well.&nbsp; In
    other words, if you're careful, you might be able to kill 10-15
    birds with one stone!<br>
    <h3>"Normal" Manual-Proofing Procedure<br>
    </h3>
    If you want to help in proofing comments in existing source files
    for the problematic AGC versions listed above, here are the
    instructions for doing so, you simply have to compare the scanned
    program listing and the source-code files side-by-side.<br>
    <br>
    Specific instructions are TBD.
    <h3>Advanced Manual-Proofing Technique</h3>
    If you have the appropriate software to do so, there is a quick
    technique by which comment fixes that have been made in the past for
    one type of spacecraft or mission can be ported to the source code
    for other spacecraft or missions.&nbsp; This is so because of the
    way the source-code files have been created.&nbsp; We started with
    the source code for one mission, then modified it (via the "code
    conversion" technique described earlier) for another mission, then
    modified those files for still other missions.&nbsp; Each time the
    code was modified, some comment-fixes may have been made, but
    probably were not back-ported to earlier source-code files.&nbsp; So
    if we <span style="font-style: italic;">compare</span> the
    corresponding source code for different missions, we can easily
    pinpoint where some corrections can be made.&nbsp; While this
    doesn't find all of the broken comments, it can help to find a lot
    of them with reduced effort by leveraging work that others have
    already done.<br>
    <br>
    For example, the Luminary 131 (Apollo 13 LM) source code hasn't
    really had its comment-text proofed, but we'd suppose that it was
    probably very similar to the Luminary 99 (Apollo 11 LM) source code.<br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, there are automated techniques for locating such
    differences, but you need the appropriate software to do so.&nbsp;
    On Linux, I use a (free) tool called <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">kompare</span> for this, but <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_comparison_tools">
      there are any number of such tools for different computer
      platforms</a> that may be suitable.&nbsp; Similar programs which
    can be had for free on Windows and Mac OS X are <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">WinMerge</span> and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">FileMerge</span>, respectively.&nbsp;
    I'll simply illustrate the technique using <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">kompare</span>.&nbsp; If I run kompare
    on Luminary099/INTERPRETER.s and Luminary131/INTERPRETER.s (as of
    2009-06-20), an excerpt of the comparison is seen below.&nbsp;
    (Click to enlarge if it's hard to read.)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <a
        href="CommentProofWithKompare.jpg"><img alt="" title="Click to
          enlarge" src="CommentProofWithKompare-small.jpg"
          style="border: 2px solid ; width: 787px; height: 575px;"
          width="787" height="575"></a><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    A number of differences are immediately apparent:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>At lines 189 and 193 (using the numbers from the left-hand
        pane), we see page number differences.&nbsp; These are perfectly
        appropriate since the code does appear on different pages in
        these two versions of the AGC code.</li>
      <li>At lines 182, 220, and 224, we see some code (rather than
        comment) differences, but actually, this is a case in which the
        change might be profitably ported over from one file to the
        other.&nbsp; The difference is that a space has been changed to
        a tab, and while this difference is unimportant to the software
        that processes the source code, the use of the tab instead of
        the space means that the fields line up better according to the
        preferred code-formatting described in step #6 of the "code
        conversion" section above.</li>
      <li>Finally, at line 195 we seen actual fix to a program comment,
        namely that the word "ARTGHMETIC" has been corrected to
        "ARITHMETIC".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But remember, just because Luminary 99 has been proofed and
      Luminary 131 has not, that doesn't mean that Luminary 99 is
      automatically right!&nbsp; This is just a technique for helping
      you to see where errors <i>might</i> be likely to exist, and not
      to assure you of that.&nbsp; You need examine the Luminary 131
      scan to really know whether or not to make these changes.<br>

    <h1><a name="Source-Code_Annotation" id="Source-Code_Annotation"></a>Source-Code









      Annotation</h1>
    For those who are interested in providing help that requires a much
    greater involvement in understanding the technical aspects of
    AGC/AGS source code, such as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    program, there is an interest in having an on-going program of
    providing modern annotations to the AGC/AGS source code.&nbsp; Such
    modern annotations can provide assistance to others examining the
    code, and can therefore be viewed as an educational service.&nbsp;
    Annotating the source code can help the student in several ways:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>It can provide entertaining background information.&nbsp; For
        example, in the source code which produces 1201/1202 alarms,
        background information about the 1201/1202 alarms during the
        Apollo 11 landing can be added.<br>
      </li>
      <li>It can supplement the sometimes sketchy program comments
        provided by the original developers.&nbsp; They say that you
        never really understand a subject until you can teach it to
        others.&nbsp; Well, here's your chance!<br>
      </li>
      <li>It can list or hyperlink helpful relevant resource
        materials.&nbsp; For example, INTERPRETER.s could have a
        hyperlink to the manuals describing AGC interpreter language.</li>
      <li>It can give information about the developers themselves, which
        is almost entirely lacking in the original source code.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    At present (20090703), this effort has barely begun.&nbsp; To get an
    idea of what some annotations might look like, you can look at the <a
href="listings/Luminary099/PINBALL_GAME_BUTTONS_AND_LIGHTS.agc.html">Apollo










      11 LM PINBALL program</a>.<br>
    <br>
    In order to provide such annotations, it is necessary to understand
    the markup language and strategy being used, which is <a
      href="SourceAnnotations.html">described here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    There is presently not total agreement as to the best method of
    managing the annotation efforts, so any procedure for doing so is
    TBD.<br>
