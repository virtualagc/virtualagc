# Filename:	Test.obc
# Purpose:	This is Gemini OBC code created solely for the purpose
#		of testing the OBC assembler, yaASM.  I don't claim
#		that the program implemented by this source code has
#		any interesting functionality beyond that.
# Website:	http://www.ibiblo.org/apollo/Gemini.html
# Mod history:	2011-12-15 RSB	Created.
#
# This code doesn't account for any of the physical constraints of the
# OBC such as the need to avoid certain instructions sequences to prevent
# overheating or the need to periodically refresh delay lines.  It's simply
# a logical test of the assembler, and nothing more than that.  
#
# What the code actually does is to loop endlessly, calling EVENFN on even
# iterations and ODDFN on odd iterations.  The functions EVENFN or ODDFN
# do something (or nothing, depending on my whim), and then return to the
# main loop.  Just for fun, I put the main loop, EVENFN, and ODDFUN in
# different memory sectors.  I've thrown in various random comments and 
# variables/constants that aren't used, as well, just to exercise the 
# assembler and see if the output listing is reasonably aesthetically
# pleasing.

#        	******** IMPORTANT NOTE ********
# DATA and CODE are operators I invented for the new OBC assembler, yaASM,
# and which don't exist in the original OBC assembler as far as I can
# ascertain.  DATA sets the current pointer for assembling variables 
# and constants, while CODE sets the current pointer for assembling 
# instructions.  The operand is of the form SECTOR-SYLLABLE-WORD for OBC
# (or MODULE-SECTOR-SYLLABLE-WORD for LVDC).  Multiple DATA or CODE
# operators can appear in the file, in order to assemble different
# blocks of source code into different regions of memory. DATA and CODE
# use whatever mode (half-word or normal) that happens to be in effect
# at the moment.  The newly-invented directives HALF and NORM
# can be used to change that mode at any time.

		DATA	00-0-000

# In real OBC code, I think that the first variable in sector 0000 would 
# always be named KZERO and have the value 0 ... so, here it is:
KZERO		OCT	0

# VARIABLES.  Any left-hand symbol without an operator allocates
# an uninitialized variable at the current data address.  So if we
# happened to be at 00-0-001 right now (which we are, since we defined
# the constant KZERO above), they'd be at 00-0-001, 00-0-002, and so on.

# The following are supposed to be HOP constants.  The bit ordering I'm
# using is actually the exact opposite of what I *think* the documentation
# says it's supposed to be, but basically I don't believe what the 
# documentation says.  HEVENFN, HODDFN, and HLOOP are supposed to point to
# the left-hand symbols EVENFN, ODDFN, and LOOP, respectively, which 
# appear later in the code.  There's a newly-invented directive, HOPC,
# to do this, so as to avoid having manually figure out the addresses of
# the targets and form OCT constants instead.  But I do show what OCT
# constants I think should have been formed.

# CODE

# Recall that we're at address 00-2-0000 here (because of the CODE directive
# we used earlier), so this is where the program would start executing if we 
# actually ran it.  The left-hand symbol START isn't referenced, but the
# code looks prettier if it's there.
START		CLA	KZERO		# Get 0 into accumulator
		STO	LOOPCNT		# Save it ... it's our loop counter.
# What our loop is going to do is to HOP using HOP constant
# HEVENFN on even loop counts and HODDFN on odd loop counts.  (The code
# pointed to by HCONST1 and HCONST2 will always end up coming back to LOOP
# so that we can perform the next iteration.)
LOOP		CLA	LOOPCNT		# Get the loop counter.
		SUB	K1		# Decrement it.
		STO	LOOPCNT		# Save it back to memory.
		AND	K1		# Test the least significant bit.
		TNZ	*+2		# On even iterations do one thing.
		HOP	HODDFN		# On odd iterations do different thing.
		HOP	HEVENFN

# The routines pointed to by HCONST1 and HCONST2 are in memory sectors 05 and
# 07 rather than sector 00 like the code above, so we have to use the CODE 
# directive to change the assembler's instruction pointer to those sectors.  
# The left-hand symbols EVENFN and ODDFN aren't actually referenced elsewhere, 
# but we add them just to look pretty. 

# This one just does nothing.
