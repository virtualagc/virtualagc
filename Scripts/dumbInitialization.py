# Filename: 	dumbInitialization.py
# Purpose:	In a dumb manner, try to create flip-flop initialization data for 
#		Verilog files made by dumbVerilog.py.  The idea is to set all of the
#		nets to 0, and then just keep reevaluating the logic (in a random
#		order that changes with each iteration) until the values no longer
#		change.  This is then a globally consistent initialization.
#		It works, and converges pretty fast.
# Mod history:	2018-10-03 RSB	Created.
#		2018-10-04 RSB	Handled nets driven from different modules.
#		2018-10-05 RSB	Now additionally outputs a file called
#				dumbInitialization.log, which lists the 
#				initialization values assigned to each 
#				applicable net, nicely alphabetized.
#		2018-10-11 RSB	Should work with both WIRETYPEs now (instead
#				of just with "wand").  For some reason, 
#				including STOPA in the list of nets that 
#				initialize to 0 causes the process not to
#				converge, so I've had to remove it.  Added
#				a number of other explicit initializations,
#				though, to help get a pretty simulation rather
#				than just a correct one.  Specifically, 
#				gets rid of a bunch of involuntaries at startup.
#		2018-10-19 RSB	Had forgotten to take care of signals set 
#				with "reg SIGNAL=1" within the test bench.
#		2025-02-16 RSB	Converted to Python 3.

# Usage is:
#	cat VERILOG_FILES | dumbInitialization.py
# where the input VERILOG_FILES include files for A1 through A24.
# The result is a series of files A1.init, A2.init, ..., A24.init.
# You can use a smaller set of module files, but the initialization will
# be independent of the modules that aren't included, and therefore
# possibly inconsistent with them.

# Certain flip-flops we want to make sure are initialized specifically to 0 or 1.

# of getting a nice setup that produces a simulation without various extraneous stuff
# at startup (like PINCs) that I usually want to ignore, or that I'd like to use in
# making comparisons with other simulations (like Mike's) that initialize differently.  
# Realize that these wishes may not always be possible to achieve, in which case
# this process will never converge, or that the settings might be immediately
# undone at startup by some other flip-flops that are initialized wrong.  So
# some care needs to be taken in these selections.
