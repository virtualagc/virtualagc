# Filename: 	dumbVerilog.py
# Purpose:	Converts KiCad AGC "logic flow diagrams" to Verilog
# Mod history:	2018-09-29 RSB	First time I remembered to add the GPL and
#				other boilerplate at the top of the file.
#				Various new things, though, like: better formatting
#				of module parameters and wire lines in the output
#				Verilog; treatment of netnames that begin with a
#				digit (not allowed in Verilog).
#		2018-10-01 RSB	Added signal-name translations of "-" to "m". 
#				Now allow for case where output of NOR is directly
#				tied to ground.  Found that some netnames assigned
#				only by net labels had a weird form I wasn't 
#				accounting for.
#		2018-10-04 RSB	Replace my "assign" statements by 
#				"pullup; assign (highz1,strong0)" statements.  I 
#				thought they worked to solve my problem (which was
#				wire-anding the outputs of gates from different 
#				modules), but it didn't.  I then replaced all my
#				"wire" specifications by "wand" specifications and,
#				once again, I think that works.
#		2018-10-05 RSB	Added optional SCHEMATIC.sch input.  Also, began 
#				adding a way to use the command-line to specify
#				translating with pullups instead of wands, but that
#				doesn't yet work.  Wasn't treating net labels in 
#				sheets 2 or 3 properly --- i.e., they only worked
#				right in sheet 1.
#		2018-10-08 RSB	Think that the optional pullup/wire construct may
#				be working now.  I think my problem was using
#				bitwise negation something I hadn't specified to
#				be 1 bit wide, when I should have used logical 
#				negation.  Maybe.  For what it's worth, I did 
#				a full-AGC simulation (in its current state, of
#				of course, which isn't fully functional) for 20 ms.,
#				and compared all backplane signals for wand vs
#				wire/pullup/1bz, and they were all absolutely 
#				identical in level and timing.  Added some handling
#				for the "ROM", "RAM", and "BUFFER" symbols.
#		2018-10-10 RSB	Changed the default build type to "wire", since 
#				the simulation isn't currently working correctly
#				with "pullup".
#		2018-10-18 RSB	Added A52.
#		2018-10-27 RSB	Changed simulation time units from 100ns/1ns to 1ns/1ps.
#		2025-01-06 RSB	Converted from Python 2 to Python 3 using the 2to3 
#				utility.
#		2025-01-17 RSB	Account for the "unconnected" nets which KiCad now
#				may add to the netlists.
#
# This script converts one of my KiCad transcriptions of AGC LOGIC FLOW DIAGRAMs
# into Verilog in the dumbest, most-straightforward way.  In other words, I don't
# claim it's good or efficient Verilog, but merely that it is functional and 
# easily verifiable.  I view this as a first stage in a possible process of
# producing successively more-efficient Verilog implementations, though if it
# works well enough, then possibly ... it works well enough.  :-)  We'll see.
#
# Right now, though, the Verilog don't trust the Verilog it generates too much,
# unless it has been verified in some way.

# The inputs required are these:
#
#	MODULE		The name of the AGC logic module: A1, A2, etc.
#	FILENAME.net	A netlist as output by KiCad in "OrcadPCB2" format of a single AGC
#			LOGIC FLOW module (A1-A24,A52).  This is not just any arbitrary version
#			of the KiCad transcriptions, but rather one of the initial ones I 
#			intended to be visually accurate representations of the original
#			scans.  The translator understands only a couple of kinds of 
#			components.
#	/PATH/pins.txt	This is a "CSV" dump of the PINS table of Mike's pin DB from
#			https://github.com/virtualagc/agc_hardware/blob/block2/delphi.db.
#			The dump should use a space as the field delimiter and not quote
#			the fields, and no header line is needed.  This file is used only
#			to create names for the inputs and outputs, and to determine which
#			of the signals actually are inputs vs outputs.
#	DELAY		A global delay (in units of simulation cycles), applied to all NOR
#			gates.  By default there is no delay.
#	FILENAME.init	A file containing initial values for NOR-gate outputs, where 
#			needed ... which is only for logic with feedback, such as flip-flops.
#			The initializations don't have to be a "good" condition (since the
#			original hardware just settled into whatever state it happened to 
#			like), but rather any stable state.  Otherwise, in iverilog, the
#			circuit will simply oscillate uncontrollably.  The file can also
#			contain delays to be applied to specific NOR gate outputs, overriding
#			the global DELAY setting for those particular gates.
#	[SCHEMATIC]		Optional name of the schematic file.
#
# The Verilog is output to stdout.
#
# The basic idea is this:  The FILENAME.net input represents a single AGC "module".  This
# AGC module will be transformed into a single Verilog module.  All of the inputs and outputs
# of the Verilog module will be the non-spare connector pads of the AGC module.  Which are
# inputs and which are outputs are determined by pins.txt, but *could* be determined by the
# following simple rule: if connected to the output of any NOR gate, they are outputs, while
# if connected to no NOR-gate outputs, they are inputs.  Any net with a name like 0VDC* is
# treated a logic low, and all pads connected to it are ignored, as are all pads connected 
# to the chassis ground symbol.  Any net with a name like +4* or FAP is treated as logic 
# high and its pads are similarly ignored.
#
# The only component other than connectors in these diagrams is the 10-pin dual 3-input NOR gate,
# and we can simply hard-code the properties of that component into the script.
