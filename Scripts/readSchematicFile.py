Important note:  As presently implemented, we rely on the assumption that while
digital circuits (i.e., NOR gates) and connectors may reside in sub-sheets of 
the top-level drawing, they cannot reside in reusable blocks implemented as 
separate sheets.  The distinction is that reference designators found in all 
subsheets are used *as-is* rather than being altered according to the particular
block instance.  So if NOR gates (or connectors) appeared in reusable blocks, 
they would have the same reference designators in each instance of the block.  
Which would be bad.  This already happens with analog components such as 
resistors, of course, but we don't care since we're not extracting any info 
about them because they're irrelevant to the Verilog simulation.

The information which `readSchematicFile()` needs to return about the schematic
is minimal, and the info is returned in the 5 global variables `gateLocations`
and `schPadsJ1` through `schPadsJ4`.

`gateLocations` is a dictionary for which the keys are the reference designators
of the NOR gates (suffixed with A or B since dual-NOR chips were used); the 
values for the keys are the so-called location codes.  Recall that each 
NOR gate had a 5-digit location code that was unique throughout the AGC/.

As for `schPadsJx`, it is a list.  The assumption is that there were 4 buses 
used to transfer signals among the AGC's digital modules, labeled (according to
their connector reference designators) as J1 through J4.  Each bus has 72 signals.
The lists `schPadsJx` simply give the net name for each individual signal
on the bus, or "?" if none.

Note, though, that the pin-numbering on connector Jx does not begin at 1.  Rather,
J1 begins at pin 101, J2 begins at pin 201, J3 begins at pin 301, and J4 begins
at pin 401.  Which is convenient for telling at a glance, just from the pin
number, which connector the signal is on.

Thus all `readSchematicFile()` has to do is associate NOR-gate reference 
designators with 5-digit "location" numbers and to determine which signals 
appear at which pins of which connectors.

The schematic 2005250- was used to compare KiCad 5 vs KiCad 6 correct vs
KiCad 6 fast.  They all produce the same result on that test file.

Read KiCad v6 or later files.  Two methods are implemented:  the "correct"
method (fast=False) and the "fast" method (fast=True).  The latter is the 
default.

The "correct" method was implemented first.  It creates a set of BNF rules 
(or more accurately, TatSu rules) defining the grammar of a *.kicad_sch file, 
then parses the file according to those rules and then from the parse tree
picks off the very-few data we actually need.  The problem is that it is 
phenominally slow.  For even the tiny testVerilog schematic, it take 8 
seconds (on my computer) to parse it!  A logic module like 2005250- takes
an astounding 2 minutes.  Presumably the problem is the deeply hierarchical 
lisp-like grammar.  

I think the "correct" method could perhaps be sped up to create a "medium"
method (which I haven't done, because it's less simple than it sounds) by just 
stripping off the enclosing 
	(kicad_sch ... )
and then parsing each enclosed member separately. 

The "fast" method does simple pattern-matching to find the data; it takes a 
miniscule fraction of a second. The problem is that it relies on the formatting
(vs the grammar) of the schematic file, and is therefore dependent on "stylistic" 
features that are presumably more likely to change from one version of KiCad to 
another than is the grammar.
