  Binaries</h2><span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Disclaimer:</span>&nbsp; I really
  <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> don't know how to
  package programs for installation on Mac OS X.&nbsp; The binaries
  may not work on your system.&nbsp; The installation procedures
  may not work on your system, and are complex compared to what
  you're used to (but easier than building from source).&nbsp; I
  know that it worked on the 10.2 machine I used to build it, and I
  have feedback (from Fabrizio Bernardini) that the binary package
  works fine on 10.3.&nbsp; On the other hand, I personally tried
  to install it on a friend's 10.3 machine, and the installation
  failed at step #3, so I never got to find out if the Virtual AGC
  program ran or not.&nbsp; Hopefully it'll work for you; if not,
  you may still need to end up building Virtual AGC yourself, as
  described <a href=
  "#Building_Virtual_AGC_in_Mac_OS_X">below</a>.&nbsp; If the
  binary installation works for you, or if you understand how to
  improve the process, let me know.&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp; giving me a
  link to a 10-page howto is <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">not</span> the level of help I'm looking
  for.)&nbsp; I apologize for the complexity relative to what
  you're used to, but at my level of Mac OS (non-)skill you're
  lucky to get anything at all.&nbsp; :-)<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Another disclaimer:</span>&nbsp;
  I should warn you, I suppose, that it takes <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">so long</span> to install the prerequisites
  you need to run Virtual AGC, that you get very little advantage
  from installing the Virtual AGC binary package rather than simply
  building Virtual AGC from source.&nbsp; But enough
  negativity!&nbsp; Let's get installing!<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation:</span><br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install the X-window system (<span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">XFree86</span>).&nbsp; For Panther, this
    is apparently an optional install from your Apple-supplied Mac
    OS X CDs.&nbsp; For Jaguar, you can download from the <a href=
    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/">XonX
    project</a>.<br></li>
    <li>Install <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">fink</span></a>, which is a program that
    is used to install other programs.&nbsp; Make sure that you
    choose the version of <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">fink</span> that works with your version
    of Mac OS X, and follow the instructions on the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">fink</span> webpage.&nbsp;<br></li>
    <li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">fink</span> to install
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> version 2.&nbsp;
    This is done from the command-line with "<span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install gtk+2</span>".</li>
    <li>Now download the current Mac OS X binary package of Virtual
    AGC (yaAGC-macosx-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span>.tar.bz2).&nbsp; On my
    computer, <span style="font-weight: bold;">stuffit</span>
    automatically unpacked this when I downloaded it.&nbsp; If not,
    you'll have to manually unpack it from the command line, as
    follows:</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Desktop</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">bunzip2
    yaAGC-macosx</span><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;"><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar.bz2</span>
  </div>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Install, with this command:</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo tar --directory=/
    -xf yaAGC-macosx</span><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;"><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar</span>
  </div>
  <ol start="6">
    <li>You'll probably still want the source-code tarball, since
    it contains a lot of stuff (like source code for the Luminary
    and Colossus programs) that aren't in the binary tarball.&nbsp;
    So download yaAGC-dev-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span>.tar.bz2 and unpack
    it, thus creating a directory called "yaAGC" containing the
    stuff listed at the top of the page:</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">tar --bzip2 -xf
    yaAGC-dev</span><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;"><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar.bz2</span>
  </div>
  <ol start="7">
    <li>If you want to run Stephan Hotto's <a href=
    "yaTelemetry.html"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span></a> program (and I bet
    you do!), you'll need to install <a href=
    "http://www.tcl.tk/"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this
    either by following the instructions at the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> website, or else use
    "<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install
    tcltk</span>".&nbsp; (I did the latter, myself, so I can't
    really vouch for the former.)<br></li>
    <li>Running the program is a little more complex than you're
    used to:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the X-window system.&nbsp; This will (as a side
      effect) probably cause several command-line windows to open
      up.</li>
      <li>In one of the command-line windows that opened up, type
      the following:</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 120px;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">set path = ($path
    /usr/local/yaAGC/bin)</span><br style=

    <span style="font-family: monospace;">SimLuminary131<br></span>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases, the simulated DSKY won't immediately
      display on the screen.&nbsp; Instead, the cursor will simply
      change shape, indicating that it wants you to position the
      DSKY on the screen.&nbsp; Click on the screen, and the
      simulated DSKY will appear where you click.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <ol start="9">
    <li>You can stop the program simply by stopping the X-window
    system.&nbsp; If you don't want to do that (say, because you
    have other X programs running also), then stopping the program
    is also a little complex:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the mouse to focus the command-line window you used
      to start the program.</li>
      <li>Hit ctrl-C on the keyboard to stop the CPU
      emulation.</li>
      <li>Type the command "<span style=
      "font-family: monospace;">killall yaDSKY</span>" to stop the
      DSKY emulation.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ol start="10">
    <li>Enjoy, if you're still capable of it after all
    that!<br></li>
  </ol><span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Uninstallation:</span>&nbsp; Just remove the
  /usr/local/yaAGC directory containing the binaries, and the
  Desktop/yaAGC directory containing the sources.<br>
  <h2><a name="Building_Virtual_AGC_in_Mac_OS_X" id=
  "Building_Virtual_AGC_in_Mac_OS_X"></a>Building Virtual AGC in
  Mac OS X</h2>I had significant help in getting Virtual AGC
  working on Mac OS X.&nbsp; Matteo Giani was the first to get
  Virtual AGC working, on Mac OS X Panther (10.3); in Virtual AGC
  version 20040828 and later I've incorporated the changes he
  needed to make to get it to work.&nbsp; <a href=
  "MacOSscreenshot.pdf">Here's a screenshot</a> Matteo has given
  me.&nbsp; After some additional advice from <a href=
  "GregDunnPanther.txt">Greg Dunn</a>, and the appearance of a
  document from Apple called "<a href=
  "http://developer.apple.com/darwin/runningx11.html">Configuring
  and Running X11 Applications on Mac OS X</a>", I've managed to
  get Virtual AGC working in Mac OS X Jaguar (10.2) as well.&nbsp;
  Presumably it will work in all other versions of Mac OS X, but I
  can hardly guarantee it.&nbsp; In fact, I have had reports that
  it failed to build even on some 10.3 machines, so apparently it's
  not entirely consistent.<br>
  <br>
  While none of the steps below is difficult, building the software
  nevertheless requires a lot more command-line work than the
  typical Mac OS X user finds congenial.&nbsp; A binary installer
  would be <span style="font-style: italic;">much</span> better for
  the typical user.&nbsp; Sadly, I don't know how to package the
  executables to allow them to be installed directly on a Mac
  without all of this nonsense, because I'm not a Mac software
  developer at heart and haven't the energy to learn.&nbsp;
  Step-by-step instructions for creating an installer (perhaps in
  the form of mods to the makefiles) from anybody who <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">does</span> know would be very welcome.<br>
  <br>
  The following instructions have been tested on a pristine
  installation of Jaguar (10.2.8).&nbsp; (In other words, I
  completely wiped my Mac and reinstalled Mac OS X, just to make
  sure these instructions would work.)&nbsp; To begin with, you'll
  need to install a substantial amount of stuff on your Mac.&nbsp;
  It will use up a lot of disk space and take a long time to do
  so.<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install Apple's "developer tools", either from the CD that
    Apple supplies with the Mac OS X installation CDs, or as a
    download from Apple.</li>
    <li>Install the X-window system (<span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">XFree86</span>).&nbsp; For Panther, this
    is apparently an optional install from your Apple-supplied Mac
    OS X CDs.&nbsp; For Jaguar, you can download from the <a href=
    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/">XonX
    project</a>.<br></li>
    <li>(Optional.)&nbsp; Install the <a href=
    "http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro</a> cross-platform GUI
    kit.&nbsp; This is only needed to build <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, which is presently only in
    the early development stage.&nbsp; If you skip this step, the
    build-process (below) will display warnings and fail to build
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, but will work
    normally otherwise.&nbsp; However, <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> gives you the ability to use
    the rotational hand controller (RHC) in the LM, and that
    substantially adds to the fun-factor of using the
    simulation.&nbsp; (Sadly, when <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">I</span> try installing <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span> on my iMac, it fails to do
    so, so I really don't have the option.)<br></li>
    <li>Install <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">fink</span></a>, which is a program that
    is used to install other programs.&nbsp; Make sure that you
    choose the version of <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">fink</span> that works with your version
    of Mac OS X, and follow the instructions on the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">fink</span> webpage.&nbsp;<br></li>
    <li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">fink</span> to install
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> version 2.&nbsp;
    This is done from the command-line with "<span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install gtk+2</span>".</li>
    <li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">fink</span> to install
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">automake</span> ("sudo fink
    install automake").&nbsp; These are already present on your
    computer, but the Apple-supplied version didn't work for
    me.&nbsp; Fortunately, this new version won't conflict with
    your Apple-supplied ones, which will remain on your
    computer.</li>
    <li>If you want to run Stephan Hotto's <a href=
    "yaTelemetry.html"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span></a> program (and I bet
    you do!), you'll need to install <a href=
    "http://www.tcl.tk/"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this
    either by following the instructions at the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> website, or else use
    "<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install
    tcltk</span>".&nbsp; (I've done only the latter, so I don't
    know how well the former works.)</li>
    <li>Now download the current development snapshot of Virtual
    AGC (yaAGC-dev-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">XXXXXXXX</span>.tar.bz2).&nbsp; On my
    computer, <span style="font-weight: bold;">stuffit</span>
    automatically unpacked this when I downloaded it.&nbsp; If not,
    you'll have to manually unpack it from the command line, as
    follows:</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Desktop<br>
    bunzip2 yaAGC-dev</span><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;"><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar.bz2</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>

    tar -xf yaAGC-dev</span><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;"><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
    "font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar<br>

    <br></span>
  </div>Now that all of the tools you need are installed, you build
  Virtual AGC basically by just following the same (command-line)
  instructions as do the Linux folk:<br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Desktop<br>
    cd yaAGC</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">./configure
    --prefix=/sw</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">make<br>
    sudo make install<br></span>
  </div><br>
  Having built and installed Virtual AGC, you run it like this:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>The installation of the X-window system will have provided
    some way to start the X-window system.&nbsp; (On Jaguar, there
    is an <span style="font-weight: bold;">XDarwin</span> icon on
    the desktop.)&nbsp; Go ahead and start X-windows.</li>
    <li>Starting X-windows will (hopefully) will call up one or
    more 'xterm' command-line windows.&nbsp; Within one of these
    windows, simply use the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span> or <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span> command,
    <span style="font-style: italic;">et voila</span>!</li>
    <li>Proceed over to <a href="index.html#Quick_Start">quick
    start</a> on the home page to see some things you can do with
    it.</li>
  </ul>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; The
  following advice presently doesn't work very well, and is present
  for future purposes.)&nbsp; <span style=
  "color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">It may be that you just can't build
  the software, no matter how hard you try.&nbsp; In almost all
  cases, the reason for this will be a problem in installation or
  configuration of</span> <span style=
  "font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">gtk+</span>
  <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(with which I'll
  probably be unable to help), and that all of the programs will

  In this case, as a last resort, you can do the
  following:</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">
  <ol style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">

    <li>Instead of "sudo make install", do "sudo make NOGUI=yes

    <li>Instead of running "SimLuminary131" or "SimColossus249",
    run "SimLuminary131_lite" or "SimColossus249_lite".</li>
  </ol><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">What these steps
  will do for you is to bypass the problematic steps such as
