    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Much of the Space Shuttle's flight software was written in the
      high-level language called HAL/S.&nbsp; This language was not
      ultimately used for much else, and thus is not well-known
      today.&nbsp; Moreover, while several HAL/S compilers were created
      back in the day, none are presently available in a useful form, as
      far as we know.&nbsp; Therefore, in order to compile Space Shuttle
      flight software, <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="hal-s-compiler.html">a "modern" compiler for HAL/S is
        currently being developed by the Virtual AGC Project</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>However, the lack of public awareness of HAL/S is not reflected
      merely in the unavailability of development tools for it, but also
      in a general lack of awareness of the language and of any means to
      acquire proficiency in it.</p>
    <p>For that reason, as well as to facilitate debugging and
      development of the modern HAL/S compiler, the modern compiler is
      configured in such a way as to allow running it interactively as
      an interpreter that executes each HAL/S statement individually as
      it is input by the user.&nbsp; Moreover, it provides means to
      examine the effect of that code on the values of variables, as
      well as to examine the compiled code.&nbsp; This page is a user
      manual for the modern HAL/S compiler when run in this interpretive
      mode.<br>
    </p>
    <h1><a name="Readings"></a>Readings</h1>
    <p>Before working with the HAL/S interpreter too much, you might
      want to read a few chapters in the excellent introductory book <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="Shuttle/Programming%20in%20HAL_S%20Sept%201978.pdf"><i>Programming



          in HAL/S</i></a> and/or the more formal <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; I'm going to be mentioning
          "colorization" fairly frequently for a while.&nbsp; What is
          it?&nbsp; Well, there can be a lot of screen clutter involved
          when you use the HAL/S interpreter, making it more confusing
          to use than it needs to be.&nbsp; But the interpreter can
          colorize inputs and output differently, making it much easier
          to distinguish visually between what <i>you</i> input and
          what <i>it</i> outputs.&nbsp; I personally consider this
          colorization to be extremely useful — enough so that I
          bothered writing the code to do it in the first place&nbsp; —
          but <i>you</i> may not care about it at all.&nbsp; It's your
          call whether or not to take my emphasis on colorization
          seriously.&nbsp; You might want to briefly skim through <a
            moz-do-not-send="true" href="#HelloWorld">the Hello World
            section below</a> and try to imagine what all of the samples
          would like if they were simply black.<br>
        </font></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Install Python 3 if it's not already installed on your
        computer.</li>
      <li>Install (using <tt>pip</tt> or <tt>pip3</tt>, whichever is
        appropriate for Python 3 on your system) the following Python
        modules, if not already installed.&nbsp; Unfortunately this is
        not necessarily a complete list, depending on your system type,
        but it's in the right ballpark:<br>
      </li>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>gnureadline</tt>&nbsp; (or failing that, perhaps <tt>readline</tt>;
          or failing that, perhaps <tt> editline</tt> or <tt>pyreadline</tt>)</li>
        <li><tt>json</tt></li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Download the installation-file <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="Shuttle/yaHAL-S-FC.zip">yaHAL-S-FC.zip</a>.</li>
      <li>Unzip it someplace on your local drive.</li>
      <li>You may now proceed to the next section.&nbsp; But if when you
        actually try out the interpreter you keep getting unexplained
        compiler errors, then come back here to step 6, because you may
        need to rebuild the parser program from source.&nbsp; Otherwise
        you're good to go.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you experience problems with the provided parser program,
        you rebuild it thusly.&nbsp; First <tt>cd</tt> into the
        yaHAL-S-FC folder from a command line.&nbsp; Then:</li>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>If you're running Windows, try this: <tt>cl /O2 /out
            modernHAL-S-FC.exe Absyn.c Lexer.c Parser.c Printer.c
            modernHAL-S-FC.c</tt><br>
        </li>
        <li>If you're running Mac OS, try this: <tt>clang -O3 -o
            modernHAL-S-FC-macosx Absyn.c Lexer.c Parser.c Printer.c
            modernHAL-S-FC.c</tt></li>
        <li>If you're running Linux, or any other system with <tt>gcc</tt>
          installed (like MSYS2), this will work: <tt><tt>gcc -O3 -o
              modernHAL-S-FC Absyn.c Lexer.c Parser.c Printer.c
              modernHAL-S-FC.c</tt></tt></li>
        <li>If you're running any system with <tt>clang</tt> installed,
          other than Mac OS, this should work: <tt>clang -O3 -o
            modernHAL-S-FC Absyn.c Lexer.c Parser.c Printer.c
            modernHAL-S-FC.c</tt></li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>Just to be clear, the HAL/S interpreter is very much a work in
      progress.&nbsp; You're getting it as-is.&nbsp; The HAL/S
      interpreter has been used extensively only on Linux Mint 21 with
      the <tt>gnureadline</tt> module installed in Python 3.&nbsp; I
      have much less confidence in any other configuration.&nbsp; I've
      done just enough with the interpreter in the now-ancient Windows 7
      and Mac OS 10.7.5 merely to offer a very few tentative opinions
      about how the interpreter may or may not work on Windows or Mac OS
      in general.&nbsp; If they don't work yet ... well then, they don't
      work yet!<br>
    </p>
    <h1><a name="Invocation"></a>Invocation of the Interpreter</h1>
    <p>Note that while using the HAL/S interactive interpreter, and
      invoking it, you'll always be working from a command line
      (otherwise known as a console). You'll also be using the folder
      you got by unzipping the installation file yaHAL-S-FC.zip (see
      prior section) as your working directory.&nbsp; So the first thing
      to do is to '<tt>cd</tt>' to that folder. <br>
    </p>
    <p>How to invoke the HAL/S interpreter depends on your operating
      system and system configuration:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>./yaHAL-S-FC.py --interactive --colorize --no-library&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; # in
          Linux or Mac OS, or probably any other *NIX type system<br>
        </tt></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>or</i><br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <tt><tt>yaHAL-S-FC.py --interactive --no-library &nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          # in Windows (or any other system), not having an
          ANSI-compatible command line.<br>
        </tt></tt>
      <blockquote><i>or</i><tt><br>
        </tt></blockquote>
      <tt>yaHAL-S-FC.py --interactive --colorize --no-wrapper
        --no-library&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # in Windows, with an
        ANSI-compatible command line (such as Cmder).</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    If after this you see some garbage printed on the screen or you see
    nothing in color, here are some trouble-shooting steps:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If you see some <font color="#993399">magenta</font> colored
        text but some garbage characters are printed as well:&nbsp;
        Eliminate add the <tt>--no-wrapper</tt> command-line switch.</li>
      <li>Whereas if all the text is black <i>and</i> some garbage
        characters are printed too:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove the <tt>--colorize</tt> switch and resign yourself
          to having no colorization.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Or</i> figure out how to enable ANSI support for your
          existing command-line program.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Or</i> install a replacement ANSI-compatible command-line
          program on your system; in Microsoft Windows, installing and
          using <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://cmder.app/">Cmder</a>
          has worked for me.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h1><a name="HelloWorld"></a>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>In this section, we take a very brief tour of the interpreter.</p>
    <p>Upon successfully starting the interpreter, you should see a
      prompt something like the following:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#993399"><tt>Input HAL/S or else interpreter
            commands. Use `HELP for more info.</tt><tt><br>
          </tt><tt>HAL/S &gt;</tt> </font><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    This is an invitation for you to input a HAL/S "statement", which
    we'll <i>temporarily</i> pretend is any line ending with a
    semicolon as the final character.&nbsp; When the <tt>--colorize</tt>
    command-line switch has been used, whatever <i>you</i> input is in
    black, whereas whatever the interpreter outputs is by default in <font
      color="#993399">magenta</font>.&nbsp; Otherwise, without the <tt>--colorize</tt>
    switch, everything is in black, or at least whatever default color
    your console's style setting dictate.&nbsp; You can also change the
    coloring from magenta to something else.&nbsp; (See <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Colorize">the explanation of the
      interpreter's <tt>`colorize</tt> command</a>.)<br>
    <br>
    Input the following, making sure that the semicolon is the final
    character before you hit the Enter key:<br>
    <blockquote><font color="#993399"><tt>HAL/S &gt;<font
            color="#000000"> WRITE(6) 'Hello, world!';<br>
          </font></tt></font></blockquote>
    In response, you should see:<br>
    <blockquote><font color="#993399"><tt>HAL/S &gt;<font
            color="#000000"> WRITE(6) 'Hello, world!';<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#993399">Hello,



              world!</font><br>
          </font></tt></font></blockquote>
    Now, if before trying this you have skimmed a bit of the book <i>Programming



      in HAL/S</i> as I advised earlier, you may notice some peculiar
    things.&nbsp; For one thing, HAL/S isn't supposed to have "global"
    lines of code like this that exist outside the context of a <tt>PROGRAM</tt>,
    <tt>FUNCTION</tt>, or <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>.&nbsp; But the interpreter
    <i>does</i> allow HAL/S statements outside the context of <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s
    and subroutines, and that's perhaps the most-significant of the
    conveniences the interpreter allows you vs a compiler.<br>
    <br>
    For another, in HAL/S source code can generally appear in a
    free-form fashion, in which most white-space is ignored, multiple
    statements can appear on the same line, individual statements can be
    broken across multiple lines, and so forth ... <i>except</i> that
    column 1 has a special purpose and you can't just put anything you
    like there.&nbsp; In fact, the HAL/S documentation tells us that the
    only things that can appear in column 1 are a blank space or else
    one of the letters 'C', 'D', 'E', 'M', or 'S'.&nbsp; So how come we
    were able to put the 'W' in <tt>WRITE(6)</tt> there?<br>
    <br>
    Well, that's because it turns out that when you're working
    interactively, dedicating column 1 as having some special but
    very-rarely used interpretation is very, very inconvenient, because
    you simply keep forgetting about that when you're entering
    code.&nbsp; The interpreter therefore has two modes of
    operation:&nbsp; "strict mode", in which the special purpose for
    column is just as the documentation describes; and what we might
    call "loose mode".&nbsp; Loose mode is the default for the
    interpreter, and in it the interpreter simply automatically sticks a
    blank space at the front of every line you input, leaving you free
    to start inputting HAL/S code at column 1 if you like.&nbsp; But as
    a consequence, in loose mode you can't have full-line comments (C),
    compiler directives (D), or multi-line math input (E, M, S).&nbsp;
    Instead, in loose mode, all input is truly free-form.<br>
    <br>
    Loose mode has its own inconveniences, though.&nbsp; If you try to
    cut-and-paste "real" HAL/S code into the interpreter, perhaps a
    sample from <i>Programming in HAL/S</i>, it will often fail,
    because such code will often contain things like full-line comments
    that aren't supported in loose mode.<br>
    <br>
    A dilemma!&nbsp; Fortunately, the interpreter allows you to switch
    back and forth from loose mode to strict mode relatively
    easily.&nbsp; The interpreter command for enabling strict mode is<br>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt; </font>`strict</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
          color="#993399">STRICT on.</font></tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    while you can return to loose mode with<br>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt; </font>`nostrict</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
          color="#993399">STRICT off.</font></tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Incidentally, this illustrates a general principle of the
    interpreter, namely that commands to the interpreter, as opposed to
    HAL/S source code lines, are always on a line by themselves and are
    always preceded by a back-tick character (`).&nbsp; The back-tick
    isn't a legal character in HAL/S, so that means we can always
    distinguish perfectly between interpreter commands and valid HAL/S
    source code.<br>
    <br>
    HAL/S is a strictly-typed language, in which any variable must be
    explicitly declared before use.&nbsp; Try the following HAL/S
    declaration:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt;</font></tt><tt>
        DECLARE I INTEGER;</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Notice that the interpreter simply accepts this silently.&nbsp; Did
    it do actually anything or not?&nbsp; Well, you can find out by
    asking the interpreter to show you what variables, constants, and
    other identifiers have been defined so far.&nbsp; You do that like
    so:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt;</font> `data</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><font color="#993399"><tt>Scope 0, ROOT:</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I: {'integer':
          True}</tt></font><br>
    </blockquote>
    If you want to understand this response in detail, you'll want to
    read what our page dedicated to the modern HAL/S compiler has to say
    about "<a moz-do-not-send="true" href="hal-s-compiler.html#Scopes">scopes</a>"
    and about the "<a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="hal-s-compiler.html#Data">data model</a>".&nbsp; But perhaps
    not just yet!&nbsp; It's probably clear enough to you that this is
    saying <tt>I</tt> is an <tt>INTEGER</tt>, and that's good enough
    for right now.&nbsp; And I'll say more about it below, anyway.<br>
    <br>
    So now <tt>I</tt> has been declared, but it hasn't been assigned
    any value yet.&nbsp; Let's try this:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt;<font
            color="#000000"> I = 1; </font></font>WRITE(6) 'I =', I;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
          color="#993399">I = 1 </font></tt><font color="#993399"><tt><br>
        </tt></font><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt;</font> `data</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><font color="#993399"><tt>Scope 0, ROOT:</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I: {'integer':
          True, 'value': 1}</tt></font><br>
    </blockquote>
    The HAL/S interpreter is really just a way of exploiting the HAL/S
    compiler.&nbsp; In fact, when you enter a line of HAL/S source code
    into the interpreter, it basically just runs that line through the
    compiler and then executes the object code produced by the
    compiler.&nbsp; <br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Or more accurately,
        although you probably won't be too interested in it at this
        point, the compiler produces a sequence of instructions in what
        I call the PALMAT intermediate language.&nbsp; To be clear, the
        original HAL/S compiler did something similar to this, except in
        an intermediate language it called HALMAT.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
        not enough surviving documentation about HALMAT is presently
        available to meaningfully implement HALMAT, and that's part of
        the reason PALMAT was created.<br>
        <br>
        The interpreter includes an emulator module that can and does
        execute the PALMAT code thus generated.&nbsp; You can actually
        view the PALMAT code generated from the last source code that
        was input.&nbsp; In the case of the HAL/S code just input in the
        last example, the generated PALMAT instructions look like the
        following:<br>
      </font>
      <blockquote><font size="-1"><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt;</font>
            `palmat</tt><tt><br>
          </tt><font color="#993399"><tt>Scope 0, ROOT:</tt><tt><br>
            </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0: {'number':
              '1'}</tt><tt><br>
            </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:
              {'storepop': (0, 'I')}</tt><tt><br>
            </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2: {'string':
              'I ='}</tt><tt><br>
            </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3: {'fetch':
              (0, 'I')}</tt><tt><br>
            </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4: {'write':
              '6'}</tt></font><br>
        </font></blockquote>
      <font size="-1">What do these PALMAT instructions do?&nbsp;
        Instruction 0 pushes the number 1 onto the stack.&nbsp;
        Instruction 1 pops that value from the stack and stores it in
        the variable <tt>I</tt>.&nbsp; Instruction 2 pushes the string
        '<tt>I =</tt>' onto the stack.&nbsp; Instruction 3 pushes
        whatever value had been assigned to <tt>I</tt> onto the
        stack.&nbsp; Instruction 4 takes everything currently on the
        stack, which in this case is '<tt>I =</tt>' and 1, and prints it
        to the display.&nbsp; If you're interested, <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="hal-s-compiler.html#PALMAT">you
          can read all about PALMAT on our HAL/S compiler page</a>,
        though as I said, it's not too likely to be of interest to you
        unless you're interested in helping advance HAL/S compiler
        development to the next stage.</font><br>

    HAL/S doesn't allow re-declaration of variables:<br>

    But the interpreter is a little bit forgiving, and does allow us to

    I'll describe these commands in detail later, in <a

    So far, the only example of arithmetic we've seen is a simple
    assignment, <tt>I=1</tt>, which isn't really very impressive.&nbsp;
    Consider a quadratic equation with real coefficients:<br>
    <blockquote><i>A X</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>B</i><i> X</i> + <i>C</i>
      = 0.<br>
    </blockquote>
    The roots of the equation are given by the quadratic formula, which
    if we're lucky (i.e., if <i>B</i><sup>2</sup> ≥ 4 <i>A C</i>) will
    both be real, as opposed to complex. We can program this in HAL/S,
    say with <i>A</i>=1, <i>B</i>=3, <i>C</i>=2, as<br>

    Or if we wanted to be really fancy, we <i>could</i> use HAL/S

    <tt>`strict</tt> mode first, so that the <tt>E</tt> and <tt>M</tt>

    interpreted.&nbsp; (No <tt>S</tt> lines for subscripts are needed

    multi-line math so unwieldy for code entry, but it's certainly a

    And of course, we could double-check the results by inserting the

    All of which is fine if all we need is a rather simple-minded

    I won't bother to explain the HAL/S code here, because that's what
    books like <i>Programming in HAL/S</i> are for, and they do it
    better than I would.&nbsp; And probably using less words than I
    would!&nbsp; But as for interpreter commands ... <tt>`spool</tt>?&nbsp;
    <tt>`unspool</tt>?&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp; Why are they there?<br>
    <br>
    Well, the interpreter tries to compile each HAL/S statement as soon
    as you input it.&nbsp; That works fine for basic statements that can
    fit on a single line, like declarations, assignments, or if/then
    statements, but it doesn't work out well at all for complex
    statements which are blocks of multiple statements spread out over
    multiple lines, such as a <tt>FUNCTION</tt> definition.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    There's more than one way to handle such multi-line constructs in
    the interpreter.&nbsp; One simple workaround is simply to cram
    everything onto one very long line.&nbsp; Or, use multiple lines,
    but with spaces at the end of every line, making sure that none of
    the lines end in a semicolon until the final line.&nbsp; But while
    these are easy tricks if you're only working with 2-3 lines of code,
    they get pretty cumbersome and error-prone if you have lots of lines
    in something like a <tt>FUNCTION</tt> definition.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    An easier approach is usually to "spool" the input lines, via the
    interpreter's <tt>`spool</tt> command.&nbsp; While spooling, the
    interpreter just saves everything (whether or not the lines end in
    semicolons or spaces) without attempting to process any of them, and
    then it processes all of the spooled input together when it sees the
    <tt>`unspool</tt> at the end.&nbsp; In particular, if you were
    cut-and-pasting a bunch of "real" HAL/S code into the interpreter,
    you'd probably set <tt>`strict</tt> and <tt>`spool</tt> before
    pasting, and then <tt>`unspool</tt> and <tt>`nostrict</tt> after
    pasting.<br>
    <br>
    By the way, when you create a definition of a HAL/S <tt>PROGRAM</tt>,
    <tt>FUNCTION</tt>, or <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> like this, the interpreter
    remembers the definitions, so you can use them over and over without
    re-inputting the definition ... until you <tt>`reset</tt> the
    workspace or leave the interpreter, of course.&nbsp; (The next time
    you run the interpreter, it will remember nothing you've done in
    previous sessions except for the history of what you typed in at the
    prompts.&nbsp; Though there are commands <tt>`write</tt> and <tt>`read</tt>
    to save your workspace and restore it later.&nbsp; That's something
    you have to remember to do manually if you want it, and it doesn't
    happen automatically.)<br>
    <br>
    Thus, now that <tt>ROOTS</tt> has been defined, we could follow up
    and do something like this if we wanted (though why you might want
    to I couldn't say):<br>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt; </font>`nostrict<br>

    Or for that matter, we could go whole-hog and really juice up <tt>ROOTS</tt>
    a lot more. In the version shown below, <tt>ROOTS</tt> allows you
    to repeatedly input the polynomial coefficients from the keyboard
    (until the illegal combination 0, 0, 0 is input), for which it
    computes not only real roots of the polynomial but also the complex
    roots, as well as checking the results by plugging the roots back
    into the polynomials:<br>

    The <tt>`reset</tt> command at the beginning clears the
    interpreter's workspace.&nbsp; I did that to make it easier to
    redefine <tt>ROOTS</tt>.&nbsp; Notice that this version of <tt>ROOTS</tt>
    is now a HAL/S <tt>PROGRAM</tt>, rather than a <tt>FUNCTION</tt>,
    and we can't invoke it from HAL/S code any longer as we could have

    fact, HAL/S provides no way to invoke a HAL/S <tt>PROGRAM</tt> from
    HAL/S code.&nbsp; That's because a <tt>PROGRAM</tt> is run by the
    operating system's "monitor" rather than by other HAL/S code.&nbsp;
    This allows multiple <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s to be run simultaneously in
    a time-sharing or distributed fashion. &nbsp; However, we can still

    Something you may wonder about from the source code of <tt>PROGRAM
      ROOTS</tt> is why the full-line comments begin with "<tt>C/</tt>"
    in columns 1 and 2, rather than "<tt>C </tt>".&nbsp; This has to do
    with a convention I will be using with the Shuttle flight software,
    if/when any if its source code becomes available for
    compilation.&nbsp; Full-line comments <i>originally</i> present in
    the flight software will remain as-is, presumably beginning with "<tt>C
    </tt>", but <i>modern</i> comments added by the Virtual AGC Project
    but not originally present will instead begin with "<tt>C/</tt>" to
    distinguish the modern from the original.&nbsp; Of course, this is
    transparent to the compiler, which doesn't care one way or the other
    about whatever follows that initial "<tt>C</tt>".&nbsp; Similarly,
    HAL/S allows inline comments wrapped between the delimiters "<tt>/*</tt>"
    and "<tt>*/</tt>", but by convention <i>modern</i> inline comments
    will use "<tt>/*/</tt>" and "<tt>*/</tt>".<br>
    <br>
    Another point about the <tt>PROGRAM ROOTS</tt> that I think is
    worth mentioning is that the book <i>Programming in HAL/S</i> has
    been scoured for sample HAL/S code which can be used, possibly after
    extensive adaptation, for checking the HAL/S compiler and
    interpreter.&nbsp; Those files have been included in the
    interpreter's installation file, where they have names like "<i>NNN-XXXX</i>.hal":&nbsp;


    <i>NNN</i> represents the page number in the book, and <i>XXXX</i>
    is name (if any) that the book gives to the sample.&nbsp; The <tt>ROOTS


      PROGRAM</tt> is actually just the contents of the sample file
    037-ROOTS.hal.&nbsp; But each of these source-code files from <i>Programming
      in HAL/S</i>, in principle, will eventually be available for
    cut-and-pasting into the interpreter.&nbsp; (Just at the moment,
    since the compiler/interpreter is still under development, many of
    these samples won't yet work in an informative way.)<br>
    <br>
    For example, consider the sample file 021-SIMPLE.hal, which
    repeatedly asks for values of a radius (<i>R</i>) and then computes
    <i>πR</i><sup>2</sup> until a negative radius is input:<br>

    This is perhaps a good time to briefly point out some of the
    underpinnings of the PALMAT intermediate language that are <i>not</i>
    shared (presumably) by the original HAL/S compiler or its own
    intermediate language (HALMAT). <br>
    <br>
    You'll recall that when you interrogate the interpreter to find out
    the current values of all defined identifiers (like variables,
    constants, or symbolic labels), some aspects of what the interpreter
    displays for you aren't immediately understandable without
    additional explanations.&nbsp; For example, let's use the
    interrogation commands (<tt>`data</tt> and <tt>`palmat</tt>) I've
    already showed you to see what the code sample we just used (<tt>PROGRAM

      SIMPLE</tt>) did to the definitions in our workspace:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt;</font> `data</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><font color="#993399"><tt>Scope 0, ROOT:</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l_SIMPLE:

    Not terribly informative!&nbsp; Where is <tt>PI</tt>?&nbsp; Where
    is <tt>R</tt>?&nbsp; What is "<tt>l_SIMPLE</tt>"?&nbsp; Where are
    all of the PALMAT instructions?<br>
    <br>
    Well, let's take care of "<tt>l_SIMPLE</tt>" first.&nbsp; For
    technical reasons, the modern HAL/S compiler/interpreter sometimes
    has to "mangle" names of identifiers a bit, rather than using the
    identifiers as-is from the HAL/S source code, so as to give some
    indication as to what datatype the identifiers are associated
    with.&nbsp; This is done by adding a short prefix to the name.&nbsp;
    Sometimes the interpreter hides this mangling-prefix from you (for
    your convenience in reading the interpreter's messages), and
    sometimes it may fail to do so.&nbsp; The prefix "<tt>l_</tt>"
    happens to be the mangling used for symbolic names associated with
    some types of positions in the instruction stream, including names
    of <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s, <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>s, and some <tt>FUNCTION</tt>s.&nbsp;


    Similarly, "<tt>b_</tt>" is the mangling prefix for <tt>BIT/BOOLEAN</tt>
    variables, "<tt>c_</tt>" is the mangling prefix for <tt>CHARACTER</tt>
    variables, and so on.&nbsp; In our present example, in other words,
    <tt>l_SIMPLE</tt> refers to <tt>SIMPLE</tt>.&nbsp; For the most
    part, you can just ignore these mangling prefixes as if they weren't
    there at all.<br>
    <br>
    Now as far as the missing variables <tt>PI</tt> and <tt>R</tt> are
    concerned, when the modern compiler compiles HAL/S source code into
    the PALMAT intermediate language, the PALMAT is partitioned into a
    hierarchy of what I call "scopes".&nbsp; Each scope contains <i>some</i>
    of the identifiers and <i>some</i> of the PALMAT instructions; it's
    only the complete hierarchy of scopes that together comprise the
    complete set of identifiers and complete set of PALMAT
    instructions.&nbsp; The interpreter commands we used above, <tt>`palmat</tt>
    and <tt>`data</tt>, only show us the very top-level scope:&nbsp;
    i.e., what you might think of as the "global" scope.&nbsp; All the
    global scope has in it is the definition of the <tt>SIMPLE PROGRAM</tt>,
    so that's all we see with these commands.<br>
    <br>
    But there are extended forms of the <tt>`data</tt> and <tt>`palmat</tt>
    commands which show us <i>all</i> of the scopes:<br>

    </blockquote>
    Thus there are 4 scopes overall, numbered 0 through 3.&nbsp; Aside
    from the global scope (0), a new scope is generated for each <tt>PROGRAM</tt>,
    <tt>FUNCTION</tt>, <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>, <tt>COMPOOL</tt>, <tt>DO</tt>,
    or <tt>IF</tt>.&nbsp; So in our example, a new scope (1) is
    generated for the definition of <tt>PROGRAM SIMPLE</tt>, plus yet
    another scope (2) for the <tt>DO WHILE ... END</tt> loop within <tt>SIMPLE</tt>,
    and a final scope (3) for the <tt>IF THEN ...</tt> within the <tt>DO


      WHILE ... END</tt> loop.&nbsp; As for the question of where <tt>PI</tt>
    and <tt>R</tt> are, they're in scope 1 (the <tt>SIMPLE PROGRAM</tt>)
    where they belong.<br>
    <br>
    Because the PALMAT instructions are distributed throughout the
    hierarchy of scopes rather than being in a strict linear sequence as
    would be the case for (say) assembly-language instructions, the
    compiler's code-generator explicitly adds in program labels and
    PALMAT <tt>goto</tt> instructions it has constructed specifically
    for maneuvering back and forth between the scopes.&nbsp; These are
    the identifiers like "<tt>ue_1</tt>" or "<tt>ur_2</tt>" cluttering
    the code.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; You may have noticed
        that the constructed program labels I just mentioned, such as "<tt>ue_1</tt>"
        sometimes appear in that form, and other times in what I call
        carat-quoted form as "<tt>^ue_1^</tt>".&nbsp; Like the
        identifier mangling I told you about earlier, these
        carat-quotations are present for technical reasons, and the
        interpreter just isn't as good at always hiding them from you as
        perhaps it ought to be.&nbsp; Like the identifiers'
        mangling-prefixes, you can just ignore carat-quoting.&nbsp; An
        identifier represented as the carat-quoted "<tt>^ue_1^</tt>" is
        nothing more or less than the same identifier represented
        without carat-quoting just as "<tt>ue_1</tt>".</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    Finally, insofar as scope are concerned, as I mentioned they are in
    a hierarchical relationship that you can see as follows:<br>
    <blockquote><font color="#993399"><tt>HAL/S &gt; <font

    </blockquote>
    For example, looking at scope 2 (the <tt>DO WHILE ... END</tt>
    scope), we see that its parent scope is 1 (the <tt>PROGRAM</tt>
    scope) and that scope 3 (the <tt>IF THEN ...</tt> scope) is its
    child.&nbsp; The reason I call these "scopes" is that they determine
    the scopes of identifiers.&nbsp; Any given scope (within certain
    limitations) can assess the identifiers in its ancestor (parent,
    granparent, ...) scopes, but not in its descendant scopes (children,
    grandchildren, ...), cousins, aunts and uncles, etc.&nbsp; Thus
    scope 3 (<tt>IF THEN ...</tt>") and scope 2 (<tt>DO WHILE ... END</tt>)
    can access <tt>PI</tt> and <tt>R</tt> in scope 1 (<tt>PROGRAM</tt>),


    but scope 0 (global or "root") cannot.<br>
    <br>
    By means of this "scope" system, any number of HAL/S <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s
    (or <tt>FUNCTION</tt>s, <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>s, etc.) can coexist
    within the same PALMAT workspace.<br>
    <br>
    Moreover, any number of <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s can be run simultaneously
    using it.&nbsp; This involves cloning the scope hierarchy, with a
    separate copy of the hierarchy for each running program, so that
    changes to variables by one <tt>PROGRAM</tt> do not affect the
    other running <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s.&nbsp; A slight proviso to that is
    that <tt>COMPOOL</tt> scopes are not cloned, but merely shared by
    all running <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s; moreover, the PALMAT instruction
    streams can all be shared as well, and don't need to be cloned,
    since HAL/S code is not self-modifying.&nbsp;&nbsp; I.e., PALMAT
    instructions for each scope are generated at compile time, and never
    change afterward.<br>
    <h1><a name="Tools"></a>Tools Provided by the Interpreter</h1>
    Earlier, I simply glossed over the various interpreter commands
    available, just discussing a few of them when I needed to.&nbsp;
    Some of the tools I glossed over are pretty helpful, albeit
    sometimes more helpful for the compiler development I'm doing than
    (perhaps) for someone more interested in playing with HAL/S than in
    the underpinnings.&nbsp; Still, here they are, in alphabetical
    order.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the interpreter commands are case-insensitive, and thus
    can be entered in either upper-, lower-, or mixed-case.&nbsp;
    However, HAL/S source code and HAL/S identifiers are
    case-sensitive.&nbsp; When a HAL/S identifier is used in an
    interpreter command, the interpreter-command keyword can be in any
    case, but the HAL/S identifier must be in its correct case.<br>
    <h2>`BNF</h2>
    <p>(See also <tt>`lbnf</tt> and <tt>`noast</tt>, of which the
      latter is the default.)&nbsp; The <tt>`bnf</tt> command enables
      display of a syntax tree in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) for HAL/S code
      submitted to the interpreter.&nbsp; The "official" description of
      HAL/S used by the modern compiler is in LBNF rather than BNF, but
      BNF is more-commonly understood than LBNF and thus is provided as
      an alternative.&nbsp; The full BNF definition of preprocessed
      HAL/S (derived from the "official" LBNF description) is the file
      "HAL-S BNF.pdf" provided in the interpreter's installation
      zipfile.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`CANCEL and `CANCEL *</h2>
    <p>Speaking for myself, it often happens that I enter part of a
      HAL/S source line or part of an interpreter command, or just a
      flat-out wrong interpreter command, and get stuck in a loop where
      I keep getting "<font color="#993399"><tt> ... &gt;</tt></font>"
      prompts from the interpreter as it waits for me to put the final
      semicolon in place for my bogus input.&nbsp; Well of course, you <i>could</i>
      do that, and suffer the indignity of an error message that your
      HAL/S code is bollixed.&nbsp; Usually it's more-calming to use the
      <tt>`cancel</tt> command, which simply discards the previous line
      of input, or else the <tt>`cancel *</tt> command to discard all
      of the buffered input lines at once.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`CLONE</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`clone</tt> command is a variant of the <tt>`execute</tt>
      command (see below).&nbsp; The <tt>`clone</tt> command executes
      (or re-executes as the case may be) the PALMAT instruction stream
      (beginning at scope 0 offset 0), but before doing so it clones the
      entire PALMAT scopes hierarchy.&nbsp; Thus even if this
      (re-)execution changes the values of variables, those changes will
      be in the cloned workspace, and any changes to the workspace will
      revert after the (re-)execution completes.<br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2><a name="Colorize"></a>`COLORIZE and `NOCOLORIZE</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`colorize <i>C</i></tt> command changes the
      colorization from the default magenta to the color specified by <tt><i>C</i></tt>.&nbsp;


      There are only 16 available choices for <tt><i>C</i></tt>,
      however, namely:&nbsp; black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
      cyan, white, gray, brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow,
      brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan, and brightwhite.&nbsp; Thus
      <tt>`colorize magenta</tt> is the default.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The <tt>`nocolorize</tt> command disables colorization
      altogether.</p>
    <h2>`DATA</h2>
    As already explained, the command <tt>`data</tt> shows the
    identifiers defined in scope 0 (i.e., globally), whereas <tt>`data
      *</tt> shows the identifiers of <i>every</i> scope.<br>
    <br>
    Besides those, the command <tt>`data <i>N</i></tt>, where <tt><i>N</i></tt>
    is some specific integer, shows just the identifiers defined in
    scope <tt><i>N</i></tt>.<br>
    <h2>`EXEC and `NOEXEC</h2>
    <p>By default, when you input HAL/S source code into the
      interpreter, the interpreter attempts to execute the PALMAT
      intermediate-language code it generates by compiling the HAL/S
      source.&nbsp; If you use the <tt>--noexec</tt> command-line
      switch when invoking the interpreter, this is reversed:&nbsp; The
      interpreter compiles the HAL/S source code you input, but does not
      attempt to immediately execute it.&nbsp; Of course, for some types
      of input code, such as <tt>DECLARE</tt> statements or <tt>PROGRAM</tt>,
      <tt>FUNCTION</tt>, or <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> definitions, there's no
      code to immediately execute anyway because the definitions are
      just stored away for later, so the distinction doesn't matter.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The <tt>`exec</tt> and <tt>`noexec</tt> commands override those
      command-line switches, thus enabling and disabling automatic
      execution respectively.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even if execution is delayed, the compiled code can still be
      executed afterward via the <tt>`execute</tt> command (see below)
      or <tt>`clone</tt> command (see above).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Delaying of execution isn't normally what a user of the
      interpreter wants, but it can be useful in several ways as a
      development tool.&nbsp; For one thing, if there are implementation
      bugs in the emulator that cause the interpreter to abort back to a
      command line, delaying execution lets you see what the PALMAT
      instruction stream looked like prior to failure.&nbsp; The <tt>`trace3</tt>
      command (see below) is also useful in this regard.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`EXECUTE</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`execute</tt> command executes (or re-executes as the
      case may be) the PALMAT instruction stream (beginning at scope 0
      offset 0).&nbsp; See also <tt>`clone</tt>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`GARBAGE</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`garbage</tt> command performs "garbage collection" on
      the PALMAT scopes hierarchy.&nbsp; Of course, HAL/S does not
      support dynamic memory allocation, so it doesn't have memory-space
      "garbage" that needs cleaning in the conventional techno-babble
      sense of the word.&nbsp; However, when you use the interpreter,
      you will often create scopes that are inaccessible to all future
      code, even though temporarily visible by interpreter commands such
      as <tt>`scopes, `data</tt>, <tt>`palmat</tt>, <tt>`execute</tt>,
      or <tt>`clone</tt>.&nbsp; For example, if you input the HAL/S
      code<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt><font color="#993399">HAL/S &gt;</font> DO FOR
        TEMPORARY I = 1 TO 10; IF I &gt; 5 THEN WRITE(6) I; END;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
          color="#993399">6 </font></tt><font color="#993399"><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 </tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 </tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 </tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 </tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>HAL/S &gt;</tt></font> <br>
    </blockquote>
    then new scopes will have been generated for the <tt>DO FOR ... END</tt>
    loop and for the <tt>IF</tt> loop inside of it.&nbsp; But these
    scopes are inaccessible to any HAL/S code input <i>after</i>
    that.&nbsp; Even if you input the <i>identical</i> source code line
    once again, the interpreter can't recognize that the object code it
    has already generated matches it, and hence will generate two new
    scopes instead.&nbsp; To avoid this inexorable build-up of clutter,
    the interpreter automatically performs a "garbage collection" and
    removes unusable scopes before compiling any new HAL/S source-code
    you input.&nbsp; (Admittedly, it's not perfect at doing so, and
    sometimes an unreachable scope will be buried among reachable scopes
    in a way that makes it inconvenient to remove; well, too bad!)&nbsp;
    Garbage collection does <i>not</i> remove scopes containing
    definitions of <tt>PROGRAM</tt>s, <tt>FUNCTION</tt>s, <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>s,
    <tt>COMPOOL</tt>s, or any of their descendant scopes.<br>
    <br>
    What the <tt>`garbage</tt> command does is to perform this cleanup
    immediately, rather than waiting or you to enter new HAL/S source
    code.&nbsp; Using the <tt>`scopes</tt>, <tt>`data</tt>, or <tt>`palmat</tt>
    commands you can then directly see what the effect of the cleanup
    was.&nbsp; Though unless you want to examine the scopes in this way,
    there's no need ever to explicitly use the <tt>`garbage</tt>
    command.
    <h2>`HELP</h2>
    <p>As has already been mentioned, <tt>`help</tt> displays all
      available interpreter commands, in a more-abbreviated form than
      the descriptions I'm giving you right now.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`LBNF</h2>
    <p>(See also <tt>`bnf</tt> and <tt>`noast</tt>, of which the
      latter is the default.)&nbsp; The <tt>`lbnf</tt> command enables
      display of the syntax tree in Labeled Backus-Naur Form (LBNF) for
      HAL/S code submitted to the interpreter.&nbsp; The description of
      the (preprocessed) HAL/S language used by the modern HAL/S
      compiler is in LBNF, so this format (as opposed to <tt>`bnf</tt>)
      is the most-useful way to understanding how the HAL/S code was
      parsed.&nbsp; The full LBNF description is the file HAL-S.cf,
      included in the interpreter installation zipfile.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`NOAST</h2>
    <p>(See also <tt>`bnf</tt> and <tt>`lbnf</tt>.&nbsp; The default,
      <i>vs</i> <tt>`bnf</tt> and <tt>`lbnf</tt>, is <tt>`noast</tt>.)&nbsp;

      The <tt>`noast</tt> command disables display of the abstract
      syntax tree (AST) generated by the compiler when it parses
      preprocessed HAL/S source code.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`PALMAT</h2>
    <p>As already explained, the <tt>`palmat</tt> command displays the
      PALMAT instruction stream of scope 0 (the global context), while <tt>`palmat

        *</tt> displays the PALMAT instruction streams from all scopes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Besides those, the command <tt>`palmat <i>N</i></tt>, where <tt><i>N</i></tt>
      is some specific integer, shows just the PALMAT instruction stream
      from scope <tt><i>N</i></tt>.</p>
    <h2>`QUIT<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The <tt>`quit</tt> command exits from the interpreter to the
      command line.&nbsp; Incidentally, when it does so it saves a
      history file (yaHAL-S-FC.history), which will be automatically be
      reloaded the next time the interpreter runs.&nbsp; This history
      file contains all of the inputs typed into the interpreter's
      prompt, and you can use the up/down arrow keys to browse through
      the list, as well as the right/left arrows and other keys to edit
      those lines and re-run them if you like<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`READ</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`read <i>Filename</i></tt> command reads a PALMAT file
      named <tt><i>Filename</i></tt> into the interpreter's workspace,
      first clearing out anything already in the workspace.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`REMOVE</h2>
    <p>As explained earlier, the command <tt>`remove </tt><tt><i>identifier</i></tt>
      can be used to remove an <tt><i>identifier</i></tt> from scope 0
      (the global context).&nbsp; Besides that, <tt>`remove *</tt> will
      remove all identifiers from scope 0.<br>
    </p>
    <p>No mechanism is provided to remove identifiers from scopes other
      than 0, but see the <tt>`reset</tt> command.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`RESET</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`reset</tt> command removes all scopes from the PALMAT
      hierarchy other than scope 0 (the global context), and it removes
      all identifiers and all PALMAT instructions from scope 0.&nbsp; In
      other words, it clears the entire workspace, as if you had exited
      from the interpreter and restarted it.</p>
    <h2>`REVIEW</h2>
    <p>This command is particularly useful when you've input a bunch of
      lines that haven't ended in semicolons, so that the interpreter
      hasn't compiled or executed them yet, but is simply waiting for
      you to finish up and put in a final semicolon.&nbsp; The command
      shows all of the buffered input, in case you've gotten confused
      about what has been buffered and what has not.&nbsp; For example,
      below I enter a bunch of nonsense (but not a complete HAL/S
      statement), review it, and then discard it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Who
      knows?&nbsp; Perhaps the cat was helping with code entry, and it
      turned out not to be all that helpful!<br>

    <h2>`RUN and `RUN *</h2>
    <p>The command <tt>`run <i>ProgramName</i></tt>, as already
      mentioned, runs an already-input HAL/S <tt>PROGRAM</tt> (named <tt><i>ProgramName</i></tt>)
      lurking somewhere in the interpreter's workspace.&nbsp; It does
      this in the "foreground", meaning that you can only run one
      program at a time using this method.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In contrast, <tt>`run <i>ProgramName</i> *</tt> runs the
      program as well, but it first clones the workspace and runs the
      program it as an independent thread or process, allowing you to
      run multiple programs or multiple copies of the same program at
      once.&nbsp; Or at least it <i>will</i> do so, once I have time to
      get it working fully.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`SCOPES</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`scopes</tt> command lists all of the scopes in the
      PALMAT hierarchy.<br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>`SPOOL and `UNSPOOL</h2>
    <p>As already mentioned, once spooling due to a <tt>`spool</tt>
      command, the interpreter just saves up whatever you're inputting
      without trying to compile or execute it, and only processes it
      once it sees an <tt>`unspool</tt>.&nbsp; This is useful for
      inputting complex statements like <tt>PROGRAM</tt> definitions or
      for cut-and-pasting in HAL/S source code, and is often paired with
      <tt>`strict</tt> and <tt>`nostrict</tt> respectively when
      cutting-and-pasting.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`STATUS</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`status</tt> command displays all of the current
      interpreter settings, such as "strict" vs "nostrict", "exec" vs
      "noexec", etc.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`STRICT and `NOSTRICT</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`strict</tt> command enables the interpreter's "strict"
      mode, in which column 1 has the dedicated purpose described in the
      HAL/S documentation and can only contain one of the characters '
      ', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'M', or 'S'.&nbsp; Whereas <tt>`nostrict</tt>
      (the default) instead enables "loose" mode, in which column 1 has
      no particular special interpretation, and full-line comments,
      compiler directives, and multi-line math input lines are not
      allowed.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`TRACE1 and `NOTRACE1</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`trace1</tt> command enables detailed tracing of the
      parser's analysis of preprocessed HAL/S source code.&nbsp; This is
      useful for tracking down bugs in the LBNF description of the HAL/S
      language or sometimes in the action of the preprocessor.&nbsp; The
      <tt>`notrace1</tt> command disables that tracing.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`TRACE2 and `NOTRACE2</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`trace2</tt> command enables tracing of the compiler's
      code-generator.&nbsp; This is useful for tracking down bugs in the
      code generator, and particularly in implementing code-generation
      for HAL/S features not previously supported.&nbsp; The <tt>`notrace2</tt>
      command disables the tracing.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`TRACE3 and `NOTRACE3</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`trace3</tt> command enables tracing of PALMAT
      instructions during emulation.&nbsp; Specifically, it displays
      each PALMAT instruction as it's executed, along with the state of
      the computation stack at the time the instruction is
      executed.&nbsp; The <tt>`notrace3</tt> command disables the
      tracing.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`TRACE4 and `NOTRACE4</h2>
    <p>The <tt>`trace4</tt> and <tt>`notrace4</tt> commands are
      similar to <tt>`trace3</tt> and <tt>`notrace3</tt>, except that
      the tracing is performed at compile-time rather than
      emulation-time.&nbsp; It's needed because the compiler's
      code-generator actually uses the PALMAT-emulation module to
      determine which expressions are computable at compile-time, and to
      compute their values.&nbsp; For example, in the HAL/S statement <tt>DECLARE

        X INITIAL(12 (34+32/7))</tt>, the <tt>INITIAL</tt> value is
      computed at compile-time rather than at run-time.&nbsp; (In fact,
      <i>all</i> <tt>INITIAL</tt> and <tt>CONSTANT</tt> clauses are
      computed at compile-time, but all other expressions are candidates
      for compile-time computation as well.&nbsp; Admittedly, the modern
      compiler isn't very good at this, since it works only with entire
      expressions rather than with the sub-expressions, but at least it
      gives it a shot!)<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`WINE and `NOWINE</h2>
    <p>(Linux only.)&nbsp; The <tt>`wine</tt> command enables use of
      the Windows version of the HAL/S parser, running under Linux's
      WINE subsystem.&nbsp; The <tt>`nowine</tt> command reverses that
      instead re-enables use of the native Linux version of the HAL/S
      parser.&nbsp; (This is useful only for debugging the Windows
      version of the parser without my having to actually run Windows to
      do it.&nbsp; So most likely, this is a feature only useful for
      me.&nbsp; By the way, it's monstrously slow!)<br>
    </p>
    <h2>`WRITE</h2>
    <p>The command <tt>`write <i>Filename</i></tt> writes out the
      entire interpreter workspace as a PALMAT file named <tt><i>Filename</i></tt>.<br>
    </p>
