      for All Occasions</h2>
    <p>The design of the AGC went through several stages, which for the
      sake of this discussion we'll call "blocks".&nbsp; However, the
      different block designs, while similar in many ways, were quite
      different in others.&nbsp; Rather than try to cover all of them on
      this one page, the different blocks are covered in separate pages:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="NARA-SW/E-1077.pdf">"Block 0"</a> — Earliest
        preliminary design of the AGC for which I have any
        documentation, not used in any missions, and with no known
        existing code.&nbsp; There's a single document (that I know of)
        describing it, so the link is simply to that document, rather
        than to a separate page.</li>
      <li><a href="Block1.html">"Block 1"</a> — Used for the earlier
        designs of the Command Module, which were also referred to a
        Block 1 spacecraft.&nbsp; Used for the unmanned Apollo 4 and
        Apollo 6 unmanned missions.</li>
      <li>"Block 2" — Used for the later designs of the Command Module,
        which were also referred to a Block 2 spacecraft.&nbsp; Used for
        the (unmanned) Apollo 5 mission's Lunar Module, and for all
        manned missions.</li>
      <li><a href="BlockIII.html">"Block 3"</a> — There was no such
        thing in the Apollo program, but Hugh Blair-Smith has given us
        some ideas about what it might have looked like if there were.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, <i>this</i> page confines itself just to the Block 2
      design.<br>

    <h2><a name="The_Interpreter_vs._the_CPU"
        id="The_Interpreter_vs._the_CPU"></a>The Interpreter vs. the CPU<br>
    </h2>
    If all of the software-provided functionality required for the moon
    missions had been written straightforwardly in AGC assembly
    language—i.e., in the native language of the AGC's CPU—more memory
    would have been needed for program storage than was actually
    physically provided within the AGC.&nbsp; It is important to realize
    that the AGC had no capability of loading programs into memory at
    runtime, except for extremely tiny code fragments (keyed in manually
    by the astronauts or uploaded via telemetry uplink). All of the
    software needed for the mission was encoded in the "core ropes", and
    these had to be manufactured and hermetically sealed within the
    computer unit. In other words, all of the software needed to fit
    within the 38,912 15-bit words of core memory.<br>
    <br>
    To solve this problem, the designers of the AGC chose to use part of
    the precious core memory to implement a virtual
    computer-within-the-computer—in much the same way as <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> is a virtual computer
    within another computer. This virtual computer, the "interpreter",
    was a subprogram (within the larger <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">Colossus</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    program) which when activated, read its own instructions from memory
    and executed them. Because each of the interpreter's instructions
    represented many AGC assembly-language instructions, a larger amount
    of functionality could be fitted into the same amount of core
    memory, even accounting for the fact that software was needed to
    implement the interpreter. The drawback was that implementing any
    particular functionality in interpretive language required far more
    execution time than implementing the same functionality directly in
    AGC assembly language. But as long as the program ran "fast enough",
    that didn't matter very much.<br>
    <br>
    The interpreted code is in some ways much more elegant and useful
    than the pure AGC assembly language.&nbsp; For example, the
    interpreter allows for a linear address space (which the pure
    assembly language does not), and has many "high-level" instructions
    for doing things like operating on position vectors or state vectors
    and performing trigonometric operations.&nbsp; (Thanks to Onno
    Hommes for pointing out that I wasn't giving as much credit to the
    developers of the interpreter language as they deserved.)<br>
    <br>
    It is important also to understand that <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaAGC</span> has no special support for the interpreter: <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> simply runs AGC4 machine
    code and, as far as it is concerned, the interpreter is just like
    any other subprogram within <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>. It "just
    works" with interpreter code.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>, on the other hand,
    does require special support for AGC interpreter language.&nbsp;
    Interpretive instructions are simply intermixed with
    assembly-language instructions within a source-code file.&nbsp;
    Typically, you'll find a block of assembly-language instructions,
    followed by a block of interpretive instructions, followed by a
    block of assembly-language instructions, and so on.&nbsp; Between an
    assembly-language block and an interpretive block there will be a
    call (in assembly language) to the interpreter subroutine.&nbsp; In
    other words, the interpreter subroutine expects to find the code it
    is going to interpret following the assembly language instruction
    which called it.&nbsp; Similarly, a block of interpretive code ends
    with a specific interpreter instruction meaning "stop interpreting
    and jump to the next location in memory".<br>
    <br>
    Because of this intermixing, this manual describes both AGC assembly
    language and AGC interpretive language.<br>

    <h2><a name="Formatting" id="Formatting"></a>General Formatting
      Information<br>
    </h2>
    The format of source code accepted by <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaYUL</span> differs slightly from that accepted by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>. This is partly because
    without documentation for <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>,
    determining the exact format required by it requires more effort
    than I care for; but also, formatting restrictions based on strict
    column alignment—which make a lot of sense with punch-cards—make
    little sense now that punch-cards have gone to their final resting
    place.&nbsp; (But see the <a href="NARA-SW/E-1077.pdf">MOD 3C
      Programmer's Manual</a>, which though covering an earlier,
    incompatible version of the AGC, does give some information on how <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span> was used.)<br>
    <br>
    Here are the principles used in formatting <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> source files, along with
    my stylistic preferences:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A source-code file is an ASCII (text) file, consisting of a
        series of lines.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Blank lines are ignored.</li>
      <li>The character '#' is used to begin comments. Everything on a
        source line following the '#' symbol is discarded. (In the
        original <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>, the
        source code was on punch cards, with one line of code per card.
        I believe that the entire card was a comment if a non-blank
        character appeared in column 1. I'm not certain how comments at
        the end of a line of source code were recognized; they were
        either column-dependent, or else the parser simply gave up after
        all valid fields had been parsed. In any case, <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> does not support any
        of the original <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>'s
        specific commenting methods.)</li>
      <li>If the character '$' is encountered in column 1 of a line,
        then the line contains the name of a source file which is to be
        inserted at that point. For example, if
        "$INTERRUPT_LEAD_INS.agc" is encountered in column 1, then <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> will process all of
        the file INTERRUPT_LEAD_INS.agc before proceeding to process the
        remainder of the original source file. (The original <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span> had no such source-code
        directive, since it did not process "files".)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Programmer-defined names (such as program labels and constants
        being defined) begin in column 1. They are 8 characters or less
        in size, and may contain any character except '#', and may not
        begin with the character '$'. (For example, "-1/(D)+A" would be
        a <span style="font-style: italic;">legal</span> constant name
        or program label.)</li>
      <li>A typical arrangement of items on a line of assembly-code
        would be this: optional program label, followed by an AGC opcode
        or interpreter instruction, followed by an operand for the
        opcode, followed by an optional comment. In some cases,
        additional option fields may appear between the operand and the
        comment. All fields are separated by whitespace, except that no
        space needs to precede the '#' delimiter for a comment.&nbsp;
        Stylistically, my preference is for the opcode or interpreter
        instruction to begin at the second tab stop, the operand (if
        any) at the third tab stop, options to the operand are separated
        by spaces, and the comment (if any) to begin at the fifth tab
        stop, assuming that tab stops are 8 characters apart.<br>
      </li>
      <li>In some cases, a line may have no program label but may have a
        field such as "-1", "+1", "+110", etc., preceding the opcode.
        These notations appear to serve merely as comments, and are
        simply ignored by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>.
        These notations cannot begin in column 1, or else they would be
        taken for program labels.&nbsp; Stylistically, I prefer that
        these notations begin at the first tab stop.</li>
    </ul>
    These principles are perhaps best understood by viewing actual
    source-code listings, such as ALARM_AND_ABORT.agc from the Luminary
    131 source code.<br>
    <h3><a name="ButBlankLines" id="ButBlankLines"></a>But ... Some
      Formatting Notes Regarding the Original AGC4 Assembly Language</h3>
    <p>An example of some kinds of things supported by <b>Yul</b> or <b>GAP</b>
      but not supported by <b>yaYUL</b> are provisions for formatting
      the output assembly listing.&nbsp; (By the way, notice that I said
      <b>Yul</b> rather than <b>YUL</b> in the preceding
      sentence.&nbsp; That's because "Yul" is an abbreviation—of
      "Yuletide—and not an acronym like "GAP", and so it really isn't
      appropriate to put it in all-caps, and I don't think the original
      developers did so.&nbsp; But I've only thought of this belatedly,
      and am too lazy to go back and change it everywhere.&nbsp; So
      that's the one and only time I won't call the original assembler
      "YUL".)&nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    <p>I personally didn't think that formatting commands were
      appropriate in the modern age, when computer-program listings are
      views on a computer screen, rather than as printed out on
      fixed-length paper pages.&nbsp; Plus, I didn't have any
      information about them when I wrote <b>yaYUL</b> anyway, and they
      seemed pretty mysterious.<br>
    </p>
    <p>But not everyone agrees with me about the significance of such
      formatting, and there's room for more than one opinion, even
      though I end up winning since I wrote <b>yaYUL</b>. ☺&nbsp;
      Here's what <b>YUL</b>'s author actually has to say, from a
      personal communication, regarding the formatting conventions of
      the source code and the formatting commands available in <b>YUL</b>,
      and the question of whether multiple consecutive blank lines are
      of any importance in AGC source code.&nbsp; This may be
      interesting to you if you try to read our online page images of
      AGC assembly listings.&nbsp; (Note that the reference below to
      "##Page" refers to the AGC source code we've created from those
      page images, and not to the original assembly listings.)<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small>"One question is whether a manual page break falls into
          your definition of 'blank lines' in which case there could be
          any number of consecutive 'blank lines' up to fifty-something
          for a very short page. I believe the only way such page breaks
          were put in the code was to begin a remarks card with P
          instead of R in column 1, thereby forcing it to be the first
          line on a new page. That certainly implied a fairly major
          change of topic. On the other hand, it appears this info isn't
          entirely lost because somebody has put in what looks like a
          full set of page number indicators in the form ## Page 1234.
          They look as if they appear at the original automatic page
          breaks in most cases (as they should do because the symbol
          table and other indexy things are keyed to page numbers), but
          for manual page breaks they seem to appear after the page-top
          remarks cards and just ahead of the first non-remark code on
          that page. A (small) pity, that, since it would have expressed
          the purpose of the manual page breaks better if it had
          preceded the page-top remarks. But not a big thing.<br>
          <br>
          "Within the code on a page, the blank lines were put in under
          control of an unprinted digit in card column 8, between the
          card number field and the location field. A 2 there forced a
          double-space (1 blank line) after its card, a 3 there forced a
          triple-space (2 blank lines), and I'm pretty sure the values 4
          through 8 were never used, though they were defined and
          supported. Double-spacing separated groups of assembler
          control commands from actual code-generating lines, or within
          code generally meant that the line above it (often a branch
          instruction) was not always followed at run time by the line
          below it, and triple-spacing was generally a small change of
          topic, not big enough to induce a manual page break. So yes,
          triple-spacing did mark differences in sections of code, but I
          don't see that much was lost by reducing them to double
          spacing. If your friends would like to restore the
          triple-spacings, they could (aside from peeking at sites with
          scanned hard-copy pages) limit their attention to blank lines
          that are preceded by a non-remark and followed by a remark
          line. Within that set, an educated guess as to where topic
          breaks occur will get pretty close.<br>
          <br>
          "Having said all that, if you think there were any
          non-page-break cases with more than two consecutive blank
          lines, I like to hear about them.<br>
          <br>
          "And yes, I am indeed the right fellow to ask. These minutiae
          were part of my determination to make the code easy to read. I
          can't think of any reasons for blank lines beyond those stated
          above, and I'd be pretty surprised if anybody else could.<br>
          <br>
          "The reason for providing double-spacing and triple-spacing
          logic was to make it unnecessary to have physical blank cards
          in the decks, which were frequently pulled out, carried to and
          from keypunches, and put back. A Steelcase file drawer of 3000
          punched cards was a heavy mutha.<br>
          <br>
          "You can see evidence of the above in the fact that in the
          normal flow of card numbers, the one after such a spacing is
          generally 1 more than that of the card before</small><small>—no


          missing numbers due to spacing. But having said that, I have
          to explain why the card number following a remark over 72
          columns wide is generally 2 more than the one you can see on
          the remark line. That's because the only way to make such a
          remark was to have a second card, with a 9 in column 8, whose
          columns 9-48 were printed in print positions 81-120 of the
          previous line. That feature was called 'right print'."<br>

    <h3>Bit Numbering</h3>
    AGC memory "words" are 15 bits in size—or rather 15 data bits, plus
    an odd-parity bit used only by the hardware for error-detection
    purposes, and not accessible to software. The original AGC
    documentation referenced the individual bits within a word as<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> 15, 14, 13, ..., 3, 2, 1, P,<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    where bit 15 is numerically the most significant bit, and bit 1 is
    the least significant bit.&nbsp; For <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaYUL</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>,
    the parity bit is not used and is always equal to 0.&nbsp; Thus, if
    you were able to inspect the data being used internally by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>, you would often find that
    it is shifted one bit further to the left than you would otherwise
    expect.&nbsp; However, all data in source listings, in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s --debug mode, etc.,
    eliminate the parity bit (rather than setting it to 0), and
    therefore symbolically appear exactly as one would expect.&nbsp;<br>
    <h3>Single-Precision (SP, 1's-complement) Format</h3>
    Most arithmetic operations by the CPU use the 15-bit Single
    Precision (SP) data-type, which is a variant of 1's-complement
    notation.<br>
    <br>
    In SP binary format, bit 15 is the sign and bits 14-1 represent the
    data.&nbsp; If bit 15 = 1, the magnitude is negative and is
    represented as the one's complement of the positive magnitude
    (discussed below). Bit 14 is the high order bit (highest value) and
    bit one is the low order bit (lowest value). For arithmetic purposes
    the value in bits 14-1 is thought of as a fraction. That is, the
    binary point is between the sign and bit 14. For instance, a one in
    bit 14 is equivalent to 1/2 . From a programmer's point of view, the
    programmer must keep track of the "imaginary" point's position
    within the word in accordance with the appropriate scaling.<br>
    <br>
    Notice that from this definition, zero has two different
    representations—as "+0" and as "-0".<br>
    <br>
    Some examples:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>+0 has the binary representation 000000000000000.</li>
      <li>-0 has the binary representation 111111111111111.</li>
      <li>1/2 has the binary representation 01000000000000.</li>
      <li>-1/2 has the binary representation 101111111111111.</li>
      <li>1/4 has the binary representation 001000000000000.</li>
      <li>3/4 has the binary representation 011000000000000.</li>
    </ul>
    To represent an SP number within the assembly-language source code,
    the constant—i.e., a constant representing a <span
      style="font-style: italic;">real</span> number—has an optional +/-
    sign, 0 or more decimal digits, an optional decimal point, and more
    decimal digits.<br>
    <br>
    In some circumstances, numerical constants may optionally be scaled
    by factors that are powers of 10 or of 2. To scale by factors of 10,
    the option field "<span style="font-family: monospace;">E</span><span
      style="font-style: italic;">n</span>" would be added, where <span
      style="font-style: italic;">n</span> is a decimal integer such as
    "-1" or "9". This scaling field is separated from the decimal number
    by whitespace.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, to scale by factors of 2, the option field "<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">B</span><span style="font-style:
      italic;">n</span>" would be added.<br>
    <br>
    These options may be intermixed on the same line of code. For
    example, "<span style="font-family: monospace;">+656.0 E-4 B3</span>"
    has the numerical value&nbsp; 656×10<small><sup>-4</sup></small>×2<small><sup>3</sup></small>
    .&nbsp; The net result, however, must always be a value whose
    absolute value is less than 1.0.<br>
    <br>
    In rare cases, the original source code (for example, of <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>) has a mutilated form
    of this syntax, of which a typical example would be "<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">+656.0E -4B3</span>". While <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span> may have been forgiving of
    this, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> is not; the
    spacing of the options needs to be corrected in such a case.<br>
    <h3>Double-Precision (DP) and Triple-Precision (TP) Format</h3>
    The fourteen magnitude bits of the SP format do not always allow us
    sufficient precision. To overcome this, we may represent data in a
    Double Precision (DP) quantity within two adjacent words of
    memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since each single precision word has 14
    magnitude bits, the combined quantity has 28 bits with which to
    represent the magnitude.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bits 14-1 of word 1 represent
    the more-significant bits and bits 14-1 of the second word represent
    the less-significant bits.<br>
    <br>
    Bit 15 of the first word contains the sign of the word, and usually
    of the value itself (unless, of course, the first word is +0 or -0).
    Bit 15 of the second word will <span style="font-style: italic;">normally</span>
    be the same as bit 15 of the first word but may differ in certain
    cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the signs of the two words agree, the words
    add together; when the signs differ, the words subtract.&nbsp; Every
    DP value in which the signs of the words differ can be converted to
    a representation in which the signs agree, though the reverse is not
    true.&nbsp; Some examples may clarify these points:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider a DP value whose more-significant word is +37777
        octal and whose second word is also +37777 octal.&nbsp; This
        happens to be the maximum possible positive DP value, 1-2<sup>-28</sup>.</li>
      <li>Consider next a DP value whose more-significant word is +37777
        octal and whose less-significant word is -37777 octal (40000
        octal).&nbsp; How would one convert this to a representation in
        which both words have the same sign?&nbsp; Simply subtract 2<sup>-14</sup>
        (00001 octal) from the first word and add 2<sup>-14</sup> (40000
        octal, considered simply as an integet rather than an SP value)
        to the second word.&nbsp; This gives a first word of +37776 and
        a second word of +00001.&nbsp; I.e., the word-pairs 37777,40000
        and 37776,00001 represent the same DP value.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    You may wonder why a situation ever arises in which the sign bits of
    the words of a DP value don't match, but I do not know the answer.<br>
    <br>
    For even greater accuracy, a quantity may be contained within 3
    adjacent words and is called a Triple Precision (TP) quantity.&nbsp;
    In essence, we combine 14 additional low order bits so that we have
    42 bits to represent the magnitude. Again, the signs of the 3 words
    may not match, and therefore the individual words may add or
    subtract to/from each other.&nbsp; There are no CPU instructions
    that work with TP quantities, so TP quantities are used mostly by
    the interpreter.<br>
    <h3>Vectors</h3>
    Another Interpreter convention (rather than a format recognized by
    the CPU)&nbsp; is that the <span style="font-style: italic;">x,y,z</span>&nbsp;

    components of a vector can be represented by three consecutive DP
    values.<br>
    <h3>Unsigned-Integer (2's-Complement) Format</h3>
    There are some cases, such as the CDU counters described in the next
    section, where the AGC CPU uses 2's-complement values rather than
    the 1's-complement SP and DP values described above.&nbsp;
    2's-complement is used by most computers these days, and in
    particular, is used by personal computers.&nbsp; Some examples
    should suffice to show how an unsigned integer is represented in
    2's-complement:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>0 has the binary representation (bits 15-1) 000000000000000.</li>
      <li>1 has the binary representation 000000000000001.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;2<small><sup>14</sup></small>&nbsp; (16384) has the
        binary representation 10000000000000.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;2<small><sup>15</sup></small>-1&nbsp; (32767) has the
        binary representation 111111111111111.</li>
    </ul>
    Double-precision unsigned integers are formed simply by using
    two&nbsp; consecutive single-precision unsigned integers, with the
    more-significant 15 bits preceding the less-significant 15 bits in
    memory.<br>
    <br>
    Integer constants within the assembly-language source code are
    written either in decimal or in octal form.&nbsp; In some cases, the
    context determines which format (octal or decimal) is used; for
    example, the <span style="font-family: monospace;">OCT</span>
    pseudo-op accepts an octal constant.&nbsp; In other cases, the
    structure of the constant itself determines whether it is octal or
    decimal:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>An octal-formatted number may have an optional leading +/-
        sign, and consists of a string of octal digits (0-7).</li>
      <li>A decimal-formatted number may have an optional leading +/-
        sign, followed by a string of decimal digits (0-9), followed by
        the character '<span style="font-family: monospace;">D</span>'.</li>
    </ul>
    Notice that there is some overlap betweed this definition and that
    of Single-Precision (SP) constants above. For example, "12345" could
    be either an octal integer constant or a real constant (but not a
    decimal integer constant). The difference is determined from
    context.<br>

    <h2><a name="CPU_Architecture_Registers"
        id="CPU_Architecture_Registers"></a>CPU Architecture (Registers)</h2>
    All CPU registers are memory mapped (see the next section).&nbsp;
    The registers at addresses 00-23 (octal) are central to CPU
    operations, from the point of view of the instruction set. Registers
    from addresses 00-07 are flip-flops (well, except for 07) internal
    to the processor; all other registers are specially handled erasable
    memory locations. Whenever these flip-flop registers are accessed,
    their contents get copied to their corresponding erasable memory
    locations. This link is one-way; erasable memory locations 00-07 can
    never be read, as all attempts to do so will be redirected to the
    corresponding flip-flops.<br>
    <br>
    The registers at addresses 24-61 are generically referred to as
    "counters".&nbsp; While the counter registers can be modified under
    program control, they are typically only set up by the program and
    are then subsequently automatically incremented or decremented by
    events such as electrical pulses.&nbsp; The TIME1-TIME6 registers
    are even more specialized, in that the "pulses" that increment them
    are actually provided by an oscillator, so that these counters act
    as timers.&nbsp; Many of the counters can be used to trigger <a
      href="#Interrupt_Processing">interrupts</a> upon overflow, so that
    the CPU can use them to detect various hardware conditions or events
    without having to continuously poll the hardware.<br>
    <br>
    A reader familiar with the operation of counter/timer registers in
    modern CPU types may suppose that incrementing or decrementing the
    counter/timer registers is entirely a hardware operation having no
    effect on program flow other than that caused directly by reading
    the counter/timer registers or by the interrupts generated by the
    counter/timer registers.&nbsp; This is not so.&nbsp; Incrementing or
    decrementing the counter/timer registers is (and was) actually
    implemented by the use of "<a href="#UnprogrammedSequences">unprogrammed

      sequences</a>", which are similar to CPU instructions, but which
    cannot be directly used by the programmer.&nbsp; The unprogrammed
    sequences have names like <span style="font-family: monospace;">PINC</span>,
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">MINC</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">PCDU</span>, and so on.&nbsp; When
    an electrical pulse occurs that is supposed to affect a timer, the
    CPU selects an appropriate unprogrammed sequence (such as <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">PINC</span>), waits until a safe
    opportunity appears to execute the unprogrammed sequence, and then
    executes the unprogrammed sequence.&nbsp; For example, an
    unprogrammed sequence cannot be executed until a regular instruction
    or an unprogrammed sequence already in progress has completed.&nbsp;
    This is significant because it has two side-effects that may be
    observable:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Counter/timer registers are updated shortly after the hardware
        pulses associated with them occur ... but not necessarily <span
          style="font-style: italic;">immediately</span> after the
        hardware pulse occurs.&nbsp; The exact length of time before
        updating the counter/timer is unpredictable and, in theory,
        could be as little as 1 machine cycles up to a large number
        (like 20) of machine cycles.&nbsp; A machine cycle is 11.7
        microseconds, and thus it is possible for the time-jitter in
        updating a counter to be near 0.2 ms.&nbsp; Since the fastest
        counters are updated about every 0.3 ms., this jitter can be
        very significant.&nbsp; On the other hand, the average delay is
        much shorter and most counters are updated much less rarely, and
        stackup of the delays is a very rare event, so this effect can
        usually be ignored.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Incrementing a counter/timer <span style="font-style:
          italic;">takes CPU time</span>.&nbsp; Each of the
        unprogrammed-sequence instructions which update counters
        actually take exactly one CPU cycle to execute.&nbsp; Therefore,
        the amount of time used by the CPU exceeds the time needed to
        execute the assembly-language instructions.&nbsp; Because there
        are so many counter/timer registers, the CPU time required by
        the unprogrammed sequences is not necessarily negligible.</li>
    </ol>
    It should also be noted that there are two additional timer-counter
    registers, HISCALAR and LOSCALAR, which appear as <a
      href="#io_channels">i/o channels</a> rather than as memory-mapped
    CPU registers, and therefore are not listed in the following table.<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> The "accumulator".&nbsp;
            Almost every AGC instruction uses or modifies the
            accumulator in some way.&nbsp; The accumulator differs from
            all other memory or i/o locations addressed by the CPU, in
            that it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">16-bit
              register</span> rather than a 15-bit register.&nbsp; In
            most cases this is transparent to the programmer, because
            the 16th bit is not directly observable or modifiable, and
            because data within the accumulator is automatically
            adjusted to 15 bits before most uses of it.&nbsp; The 16th
            bit is present in order to allow detection of arithmetical
            overflow or underflow.<br>
            <br>
            Internally, when there is no overflow, the 16th bit of the
            accumulator is a duplicate of the 15th (sign) bit.&nbsp;
            When a value is loaded into the accumulator from memory, the
            value is sign-extended from the 15th bit to the 16th
            bit.&nbsp; In other words, for positive values the 15th and
            16th bits are both 0, while for negative values they are
            both 1.&nbsp; When overflow occurs, however, the 15th and
            16th bits differ:&nbsp; After an operation that causes
            positive overflow, the 16th bit is 0 and the 15th bit is
            1.&nbsp; After an operation that causes negative overflow,
            the 16th bit is 1 and the 15th bit is 0.<br>
            <br>
            Various CPU instructions can detect overflow and alter their
            actions somewhat upon finding it.&nbsp; The TS (transfer to
            storage) instruction is notable in this regard, because it
            can actually be used to provide a branch upon detection of
            overflow.<br>
            <br>
            In most cases, when data is transferred out of the
            accumulator to a true 15-bit register, it is <span
              style="font-style: italic;">overflow-corrected</span>.&nbsp;


            Overflow-correction implies:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>The 16th bit of the accumulator is assumed to be the
                correct sign bit, and is copied into the 15th bit of the
                destination location; and</li>
              <li>The positive data and negative data are (separately)
                converted to a range of 0 to 2<sup>14</sup>-1.&nbsp; For
                example, if we were incrementing +16383, we would find
                that a positive overflow had occurred and that we had
                wrapped around to +0.&nbsp; Similarly, if we were
                decrementing -16383, then a negative overflow (an
                underflow) would occur, and the data would wrap around
                to -0.&nbsp; (On the other hand, incrementing -0 would
                take us to +1 and decrementing +0 would take us to -1,
                without underflow or overflow.)</li>
            </ol>
            The wraparound of under/overflowed data is very different
            from that which programmers of most modern computers using
            2's-complement arithmetic would expect, since they would
            expect that incrementing the maximum positive integer would
            give the "biggest" negative integer.<br>

              than a 15-bit register.&nbsp; This means, for example,
              that like the accumulator you can generate overflow
              conditions with instructions like</strike> <strike><span
                style="font-family: monospace;">ADS L</span></strike><strike>;
              also, the overflow can be transferred between the

                style="font-family: monospace;">XCH L</span></strike> <strike>or</strike>
            <strike><span style="font-family: monospace;">LXCH A</span></strike><strike>.&nbsp;</strike>
            For a dozen years, the L register was described as being in
            this space as being a 16-bit register like the accumulator,
            our AGC simulator treated it as such, and our "validation
            suite" of AGC software did so too.&nbsp; An intrepid
            correspondent (thanks Mike Stewart!) recognized that while
            it may be a 16-bit register, the 16th bits is in fact
            discarded and cannot be queried by software.&nbsp;
            Consequently, for software versions 2016-08-23 and later,
            the L register is now <i>15 bits</i>, as the AGC
            programming gods apparently intended.<br>
            <br>
            This is the "lower product register".&nbsp; This is a
            general-purpose register, but many instructions pair it with
            the accumulator in cases where double precision (DP)
            operations are performed.&nbsp; In these cases, the A
            register holds the more-significant word, and the L register
            holds the less-significant word.<br>
            <br>

            example, that like the accumulator you can generate overflow
            conditions with instructions like <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">ADS Q</span>; also, the overflow can be
            transferred between the accumulator and Q with instructions

            <span style="font-family: monospace;">QXCH A</span>.<br>
            <br>
            This register is intended to store return addresses of
            called procedures.&nbsp; Note that the AGC CPU has no
            hardware stack, and provides only a single memory location
            (the Q register) for storing return addresses.&nbsp;
            Therefore, it is not possible to have nested procedure calls
            unless the contents of the Q register are stored prior to
            calling a procedure and then restored after the procedure
            returns.&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPU's instruction TC is used to
            call a procedure, and the instruction automatically updates
            the Q register; similarly, the RETURN instruction returns
            from a called procedure by placing the contents of the Q
            register into the program-counter register (technically it
            does an indirect jump through Q, but the net effect is the
            same).<br>

            2000-3777 (octal).&nbsp; 5 bits are not, of course, adequate
            for selecting among 36 banks, so these 5 bits are
            supplemented by a 7th bit (the "super bank" bit) from i/o
            channel 7.&nbsp; In most cases, the superbank bit is 0, and
            so the 5-bit field in the FB register simply selects from
            among banks 0-37 (octal).&nbsp; When the superbank bit is 1,
            on the other hand, the 5 bits of the FB register actually
            select from among banks 0, 1, ..., 27, 40, 41, ..., 47;
            i.e., bank-selection is the same as when the superbank bit
            is 0, except that banks 40-47 are used instead of
            30-37.&nbsp; Banks 44-47, however, do not exist. Though the
            AGC can internally calculate addresses in this range, the
            rope selection circuitry gives up and decides to select no
            rope at all when given such an address.&nbsp; <font

              trip the parity fail alarm, causing a reset.</font><br>

            This register stores the value stored at the return address

            of the instruction) which will be executed when the
            interrupt-service routine returns.&nbsp; When the CPU
            vectors to an interrupt service routine, it automatically
            loads this register.&nbsp; When the interrupt-service
            routine returns, using the RESUME instruction, the value

            It may seem from this description that an interrupt service
            routine can return to a position in memory from which the
            interrupt vector occurred, but can arrange to execute an
            entirely different instruction than what is found at that
            address.&nbsp; I believe that this statement is true, and
            obviously such a feature would need to be used with great
            care.&nbsp; (However, I don't believe that the BRUPT
            register was really provided for this purpose; I believe
            that the BRUPT register exists for the purpose of holding
            instruction which have been altered by a preceding INDEX
            instruction, as described below under the discussion of the
            instruction set.&nbsp; The true AGC allowed interrupts to
            occur between an INDEX instruction and the instruction
            affected by the INDEX instruction, and so this provision was
            necessary.&nbsp; However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            does not allow such interrupts, and conflicts between INDEX
            and the interrupt system do not arise in <span

            Upon overflow, it requests an interrupt (T3RUPT), which
            results in vectoring to the interrupt service routine at
            address 4014 (octal).&nbsp; This interrupt is used by the
            "wait-list" for scheduling multi-tasking.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Incrementing TIME3 is 7.5 ms. out of phase with incrementing
            TIME4 (i.e., TIME4 increments 7.5ms after TIME3).&nbsp;
            Thus, if the TIME3 interrupt service routine doesn't take
            any longer than 6ms. or so, the interrupts for the two will
            not conflict.&nbsp; Software typically uses this counter by
            having the interrupt service routine reload the counter with
            a value chosen to insure that the interrupts occur at a

            reloaded with 2<sup>14</sup>-100=16284 (decimal).&nbsp;
            Because 10 ms. is usually much longer than the amount of
            time needed to vector to the interrupt service routine, it

            These counters are used to monitor the orientation of the
            spacecraft.&nbsp; Three Control Data Units (CDUs) are
            dedicated to measuring the 3 gimbal angles in the Inertial
            Measurement Unit (IMU).&nbsp; CDUX refers to the "inner"
            gimbal angle, CDUY refers to the "middle" gimbal angle, and
            CDUZ refers to the "outer" gimbal angle.<br>
            <br>
            The CDUs are like analog-to-digital converters, and convert
            the analog angles to digital data comprehended by the
            CPU.&nbsp; The IMU provides a measurement platform which is
            stable with respect to the fixed stars, and maintains its
            orientation with respect to the stars even while the
            spacecraft itself rotates.&nbsp; The platform is physically
            mounted on gimbals, and by measuring the gimbal angles, the
            orientation of the spacecraft with respect to the IMU's
            stable platform can be deduced by calculation.&nbsp;
            (Because only 3 gimbals were used, it was possible for the
            spacecraft to rotate into positions beyond which the stable
            platform could no longer maintain its stability with respect
            to the fixed stars, and would thus begin to rotate with the
            spacecraft.&nbsp; This condition, "gimbal lock", resulted in
            an inability to continue monitoring spacecraft orientation
            and acceleration, and required re-entry of all orientation,
            position, and velocity data into the computer system.&nbsp;
            A 4th gimbal would have prevented gimbal lock, but was not
            provided for some reason.)<br>

            1's-complement format, indicating the displacement of the
            rotational hand controller (RHC) in the pitch, yaw, or roll
            axes.&nbsp; The way this is supposed to work is as
            follows:&nbsp; There is a deadband near the detent, where
            the count is supposed to be zero.&nbsp; When outside of the
            deadband, the counter is supposed to continually update to
            correspond to the angular displacement.&nbsp; The count
            begins to be non-zero after the angle has reached about 2°,
            is calibrated to a count of 42 at 10° (which is the nominal
            full-scale position), and increases until reaching a
            mechanical stop at 13°.&nbsp; The counts are supposed to
            update only if the RHC counts are enabled (bit 8 of output
            channel 013 set) and when the count is requested (bit 9 of
            output channel 013 set).&nbsp; In other words, the flight
            software must enable the counters and then request new data
            whenever it wants new data.&nbsp; Furthermore, the fact that
            the RHC is out of detent is reported to the CPU by clearing
            bit 15 of channel 031 to zero.<br>
            <br>
            In practice, of course, people will be using 3D joysticks
            intended for games, rather than the actual LM RHC, so
            there's no way the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
            program that manages all this can enforce these
            angles.&nbsp; So the way it actually works is this:&nbsp; <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> assumes that the
            usable range in each axis, as reported by the joystick
            driver, is -127 to +127.&nbsp; (Any values outside this
            range are simply forced to be -127 or +127.)&nbsp; A raw
            value of 13 or less appears in the counter register as 0, a
            raw value of 97 appears in the counter register as 42, and
            all other values are scaled linearly from these reference
            points.&nbsp; The formula is Counter = (Raw - 13)/2.&nbsp;
            The maximum possible count is thus 57.&nbsp; For negative
            deflections, of course, the same formula applies but is
            simply negative.&nbsp; This formula is based partially on
            the characteristics of the LM RHC, but is also partially
            based on being able to translate from raw joystick values to
            RHCCTR registers relatively elegantly.<br>
            <br>
            It is, of course, possible to use MINC and PINC commands to
            alter the value of these register, but in the interest of
            reliablity, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>

    <h2><a name="Memory_Map" id="Memory_Map"></a>Memory Map</h2>
    The memory map of the AGC is tricky (to say the least!), and it is
    necessarily to thoroughly understand the memory map before code can
    be reasonably written or even understood.&nbsp; Mirko Mattioli
    (thanks Mirko!) has sent us a <a href="MirkoMattioliMemoryMap.pdf">diagram

      of the structure of the memory map</a>, and it may prove helpful
    to have his diagram at hand whilst reading the following
    description.<br>
    <br>
    Memory may be categorized in several ways.&nbsp; Firstly, it may be
    read-only ("fixed", in AGC terminology) or it may be read-write
    ("erasable").&nbsp; Both fixed memory and erasable memory were
    implemented using magnetic-core technology, but (obviously) using
    the cores in very different ways.&nbsp; The AGC also had a
    memory-like space called "i/o channels", which could not be used for
    general purposes, but which was used to convey commands or data
    between the CPU and peripheral devices like the DSKY.<br>
    <br>
    Secondly, the memory (but not the i/o channels) can be categorized
    as directly addressable via an address ("unswitched") or as
    addressable only via an address plus a bank number
    ("switched").&nbsp; This situation resulted from the fact that
    10-bit addresses for erasable memory and 12-bit addresses for fixed
    memory were built into the AGC instruction set, but that the actual
    amount of memory required eventually increased far beyond these puny
    limitations, until eventually 16-bit addressability was
    required.&nbsp; With each successive increase in the amount of
    supportable memory, the methods for supporting the additional memory
    became more and more ponderous.&nbsp; The CPU registers EB, FB, and
    BB, and i/o channel 7 (sometimes denoted FEB) were added for no
    other reason than to support memory-bank selection.<br>
    <br>
    With these facts in mind, we note that there are 5 basically
    different types of memory:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>"Unswitched-erasable" memory appears within the address range
        0000-1377 (octal).&nbsp; A 15-bit read-write word appears at
        each of these addresses, and the memory-bank selection registers
        (EB, FB, BB, and FEB) have no effect on them.&nbsp; This area
        includes all of the <a href="#CPU_Architecture_Registers">CPU
          registers</a> discussed earlier.<br>
      </li>
      <li>"Switched-erasable" read-write memory appears within the
        address range 1400-1777 (octal).&nbsp; There are 8 such memory
        banks (designated E0-E7), each containing 400 (octal) 15-bit
        words, and any of these banks can be mapped to the address-range
        1400-1777 by manipulating the bits within register EB (or the
        equivalent bits within the register BB).</li>
      <li>"Common-fixed" read-only memory appears within the address
        range 2000-3777 (octal).&nbsp; There are 36 (decimal) such banks
        (designated 00-43 in octal notation), each containing 2000
        (octal) 15-bit words, and any of the banks can be mapped to the
        address range 2000-3777.&nbsp; Originally, this mapping was
        performed by manipulating 5 bits within the FB register (or the
        equivalent bits within the BB register).&nbsp; However, 5 bits
        are only capable of manipulating 32 banks, and as the amount of
        required read-only&nbsp; memory increased beyond 32 banks, it
        was necessary to add an additional manipulation bit, called the
        "super-bank bit", within i/o channel 7 (FEB).&nbsp; For banks
        00-27, the state of the super-bank bit is irrelevant.&nbsp; But
        banks 30-37 (octal) are selected by setting the super-bank bit
        to 0 and writing 30-37 to the appropriate bits within the FB
        (BB) register.&nbsp; Banks 40-43 (octal), on the other hand, are
        selected by setting the super-bank bit to 1 and writing 30-33
        (octal) into the relevant bits of the FB register.&nbsp; (A
        sharp-eyed reader may notice that the super-bank mechanism
        allows 4 more banks than I've stated, by setting the super-bank
        bit and writing 34-37 into the FB register; however, these extra
        banks, 44-47, were not physically present in the AGC.&nbsp; <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> does implement these
        extra banks, but they are filled with the value 0.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>"Fixed-fixed" read-only memory appears within the address
        range 4000-7777 (octal).&nbsp; This memory is directly
        addressable, and requires no manipulation of the bank-selection
        registers (EB, FB, BB, and FEB).</li>
      <li>"I/O-channels" appear within the address range 000-777
        (octal).&nbsp; The fact that the address range overlaps that
        used for unswitched-erasable memory isn't important, since
        instructions requiring memory addresses cannot access
        i/o-channel space, or vice-versa, so there is no potential
        ambiguity between the two types of addresses.&nbsp; The actual
        set of valid addresses within the 000-777 range, and the number
        of bits used at each of these addresses, depends on the actual
        peripherals attached.&nbsp; Therefore, the set of valid
        addresses and the bit-usage varies between the Command Module
        AGC and the Lunar Module AGC, and probably also varies somewhat
        from mission to mission.&nbsp; (I say "probably", because I
        don't actually know if it varied from mission to mission or
        not.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    But wait (you ask), what about the BB register?&nbsp; I say it is
    used for bank selection, but I've not mentioned any functionality
    for it.&nbsp; Well, the BB ("both banks") register combined and
    duplicated the functionality of the EB ("erasable banks") and FB
    ("fixed banks") registers.&nbsp; In other words, if the EB and FB
    registers were completely eliminated, the same bank-selection
    effects could be obtained by working only with the BB
    register.&nbsp; Changes to the BB register are automatically,
    immediately reflected in changes to the EB/FB registers, and
    vice-versa.<br>
    <br>
    As if this scheme is not complicated enough, there is yet another
    complication:&nbsp; Small areas of some of these memory spaces
    overlap, so that there is actually not as much memory present in the
    system as it would seem from the description above.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Unswitched-erasable memory overlaps with banks E0, E1, and E2
        of switched-erasable memory.&nbsp; Switched-erasable bank E0
        appears at unswitched-erasable address 0000 independently of the
        settings in the EB register, while switched-erasable bank E1
        appears at unswitched-erasable address 0400 (octal), and
        switched-erasable bank E2 appears at unswitched-erasable address
        1000 (octal).&nbsp; If the currently-selected switched-erasable
        bank was E2, for example, the words stored within the address
        range 1000-1377 would be identical to the words stored in the
        range 1400-1777.</li>
      <li>Common-fixed memory overlaps with banks 02 and 03 of
        fixed-fixed memory.&nbsp; Common-fixed bank 02 appears at
        fixed-fixed address 4000 (octal) independently of the settings
        of registers FB/FEB, while common-fixed bank 03 appears at
        fixed-fixed address 6000.</li>
      <li>I/O channels 1 and 2 coincide with the unswitched-erasable
        addresses 1 and 2, or (as implied by the description above) with
        the switched-erasable addressed E0,1 and E0,2.&nbsp; Though
        there may be some documentation that suggests I/O channel 0 was
        mapped to address 0, this was not the case.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Processing</h2>
    The AGC has 11 interrupt types.&nbsp; Interrupts are triggered by
    external events, but usually not directly so.&nbsp; Various external
    signals affect the counter registers (see <a

    underflow/overflow of certain of these counters then trigger the
    actual interrupts.<br>

    <br>
    There is a master interrupt-enable mask, and when interrupts are
    disabled the interrupt-vectoring described above does not take
    place.&nbsp; Interrupts are globally enabled by the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">RELINT</span> instruction (see <a
      href="#AGC4_Instruction_Set">below</a>), and are globally disabled
    by the <span style="font-family: monospace;">INHINT</span>
    instruction.<br>
    <br>
    Enabling interrupts globally does not necessarily cause an interrupt
    to immediately occur even if one has been requested.&nbsp; Other
    conditions which defer processing of interrupts include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Extracode flag is set (<a
          href="#Instruction_Representation">see below</a>) — i.e., if a
        two-word instruction has been found, but only the first word of
        it has been read from memory so far.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The registers contain overflow or underflow conditions.&nbsp;
        (Since these are the only 16-bit registers, an interrupt-service
        routine would have no way of preserving the full values of these
        registers if they contained overflow.&nbsp; When there is no
        overflow, the data is effectively 15 bits, and can be saved and
        restored without difficulty from normal 15-bit storage
        locations.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Following the <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
        instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The AGC actually allowed interrupts
        between an <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
        instruction and the instruction being indexed, and somehow
        employed the hidden register B to avoid problems.&nbsp; However,
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> does not have a B
        register, and sidesteps the issue by delaying the interrupt.)</li>
      <li>An interrupt-service routine is already in progress, and not
        yet terminated by a <span style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>
        instruction.</li>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Immediately</span> preceding
        an <span style="font-family: monospace;">INHINT</span>, <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">RELINT</span>, or <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">EXTEND</span> instruction.<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">When the program
          counter is in the range 0-060.&nbsp; (The true AGC did not
          inhibit such interrupts, but at least for the present I am
          doing so.&nbsp; This should not have any perceptible affect
          other than delaying interrupts that occur with Z=0,1,2 for a
          cycle or two.&nbsp; I may relax this restriction later.)</span><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    When an interrupt request is processed, the following steps are
    taken:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The current contents of the program counter (Z register) is
        saved into the ZRUPT register.</li>
      <li>The instruction appearing at the memory location pointed to by
        the program counter is saved into the BRUPT register.</li>
      <li>Control passes to the appropriate vector-table location, as
        listed above.</li>
      <li>Execution then continues (with interrupts inhibited) until the
        interrupt-service routine returns using the <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span> instruction.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    It should also be pointed out that since an interrupt service
    routine does not preserve the values of any memory locations not
    specifically allocated to it, including the central registers, it is
    necessary for an interrupt-service routine to specifically save all
    registers which it intends to use, and then to restore them before
    returning.&nbsp; The registers ARUPT, LRUPT, QRUPT, and BBRUPT are
    provided for the specific purpose of temporarily storing the A, L,
    Q, and BB registers during interrupt processing.<br>

    <h2><a name="Instruction_Representation"
        id="Instruction_Representation"></a>Instruction Representation</h2>
    <h3>Assembly-Language Instructions</h3>
    By original design, every instruction in the AGC instruction set
    occupied precisely one word of memory (including operand), and
    consisted of 15 bits as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">CCC AAA AAA AAA AAA<br>
      </span> </div>
    <br>
    The 3-bit field <span style="font-family: monospace;">CCC</span>
    represents the instruction type (the "code"), while the 12-bits <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">AAAAAAAAAAAA</span> represent a
    memory address.&nbsp; With this simple scheme, there are at most 8
    instruction types, each of which can operate on any memory location
    (assuming that memory consists of 4096 words).&nbsp; However, as the
    number of required instruction types ballooned, more complex
    instruction encoding was introduced, and several different new types
    of encoding appeared.&nbsp; The required memory also ballooned but
    (as described <a href="#Memory_Map">above</a>), the introduction of
    banking allowed continued use of 12-bit addressing in the
    instruction encoding.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Some of the more-primitive instruction types, such as <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">AD</span> (addition), <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">CA</span> (accumlator load), <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">CCS</span> (compare), and so
        forth, continue to be encoded by the simple 3+12 encoding
        mentioned above.</li>
      <li>Instructions which operate only on erasable memory, and
        therefore can use a truncated 10-bit address space, are encoded
        with a scheme like <span style="font-family: monospace;">CCC
          QQA AAA AAA AAA</span>.&nbsp; Instruction-types in this case
        can thus be encoded in 5 bits, <span style="font-family:
          monospace;">CCCQQ</span>.&nbsp; The bits <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">QQ</span> are referred to as
        "quarter code" or "QC".</li>
      <li>Instructions which operate only i/o channels can use and even
        more truncated 9-bit address space, and are encoded as <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">CCC PPP AAA AAA AAA</span>.&nbsp;

        The field <span style="font-family: monospace;">PPP</span> is
        referred to as the "peripheral code" or "PC".</li>
      <li>Finally, a fourth bit was made available beyond the 15 within
        the instruction itself by introducing the concept of an
        "extracode".&nbsp; Instructions encoded as described above are
        referred to as <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
          bold;">basic instructions</span>.&nbsp; However, the
        instruction called <span style="font-family: monospace;">EXTEND</span>
        was introduced as a kind of escape code, in that any instruction
        immediately following the <span style="font-family: monospace;">EXTEND</span>
        instruction is no longer interpreted by the CPU as being in the
        set of "basic instructions", but instead is taken from a
        completely different set of instructions called <span
          style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">extracodes</span>.&nbsp;


        In effect, "basic instructions" use one word of memory, while
        "extracodes" use two words of memory.</li>
    </ul>
    It is also worth noting that when an instruction operates on
    double-precision (DP) values, it necessarily addresses a pair of
    words in memory rather than a single memory word.&nbsp; In these
    cases, the address field points to the <span style="font-style:
      italic;">second</span> word of the pair.&nbsp; For example
    consider the "double exchange" instruction <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">DXCH</span>, which has Code=5 (<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">CCC</span>) and QC=1 (<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">QQ</span>).&nbsp; The instruction
    "<span style="font-family: monospace;">DXCH K</span>", where (say) <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is the program label
    associated with address 70 octal.&nbsp; This instruction would
    exchange the contents of the A,L register pair with the values
    stored at addresses 70 and 71.&nbsp; The address field <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">AAAAAAAAAA</span> would be encoded
    as 00071 rather than 00070.&nbsp; The instruction itself would be
    encoded as the octal value 52071.&nbsp; This is, of course, handled
    automatically by the assembler and is not usually something of
    direct concern to the programmer.<br>

            <br>
            Note that the net effect of the way overflow is treated when

            is to allow 16-bit loop counters rather than mere 15-bit
            loop counters.&nbsp; For example, if A contains +1 with
            +overflow, then <span style="font-family: monospace;">CCS A</span>
            will place +0 with +overflow into A, and another <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">CCS A</span> will place
            037777 without overflow into A, and thus no anomaly is seen
            when decrementing from +overflow to no overflow. If <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> has negative
            overflow going into CCS, the absolute value operation will
            change it into positive overflow. All overflow conditions
            are taken into account before this operation; thus, if a
            given <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> has
            negative overflow, the negative branch of CCS is taken.<br>

            register if <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>
            is Q) is considered as overflow-corrected during this
            operation.<br>
            <br>
            There are two alternate but equally valid ways of looking at
            this operation.&nbsp;<br>
            <ol>
              <li>The double-precision (DP) contents of the A,L register
                pair (A being the more-significant word and L the
                less-significant word) are divided by the
                single-precision (SP) value in&nbsp; <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>, leaving an
                SP quotient in the A register pair, and the
                less-significant word of a DP remainder in the L
                register (the more-significant word of the DP remainder
                being 0).&nbsp; The divisor <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">K</span> is required to be larger than the
                dividend A,L; this is natural since otherwise the
                quotient would be larger than or equal to 1.0, and could
                not be represented as an AGC SP value (all of which are
                less than 1.0 in magnitude).<br>
              </li>
              <li>Or:&nbsp; The double-length 1's-complement integer in
                the A,L register pair is divided by the 1's-complement
                integer in <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>,
                leaving the quotient in A and the remainder in L.&nbsp;
                The integer <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>
                is required to be larger than the 1's-complement integer
                in A; this is natural since otherwise the quotient would
                be too large to fit into the A register.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            The signs of the dividend words stored in A and L do not
            necessarily agree with each other.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The sign of the quotient (A register) is (as usual,
            according to the rules of arithmetic) positive if the signs
            of the dividend and divisor agree, and is negative if the
            signs of the dividend and divisor differ.&nbsp; The sign of
            the remainder (L register) is the sign of the
            dividend.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Note that the sign of the dividend is the sign of the A
            register prior to the division, unless A is ±0; in that
            case, the sign of the dividend is the sign of the L
            register.&nbsp; For example, suppose that A contains +0 and
            L contains -0; then the overall sign of the dividend is -0.<br>
            <br>
            If the dividend is ±0 but the divisor is non-zero, the L
            register remains unchanged and the A register is assigned 0
            with a sign according to the rules above.<br>
            <br>
            If the divisor is equal to the dividend in magnitude and
            they are nonzero, then the A register will be stored with
            ±37777, while the L register will be stored with the
            dividend.<br>
            <br>
            If both the dividend and the divisor are ±0, the A register
            will be stored with ±37777, and the L register will remain
            unchanged.<br>
            <br>
            If the divisor is less than the dividend in magnitude,
            according to Savage&amp;Drake, "we get total nonsense", and
            there is no warning or indication of the problem; the advice
            given by Savage&amp;Drake is simply to make sure (by
            pre-scaling) that this situation doesn't occur.&nbsp; I
            assume that "getting total nonsense" was accepted for
            pragmatic reasons, and was not seriously intended by the
            designers of the AGC hardware.&nbsp; However, on the grounds
            that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> or <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> code may have
            relied on this "total nonsense" (as programmers tend to do),
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> returns random
            numbers in A and L in this case.<br>

                described below.<br>
                <br>
                Fortunately, I have been able to obtain an explanation
                directly from Hugh Blair-Smith:&nbsp; The <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">EDRUPT</span>
                instruction is so-called because it was requested by
                programmer Ed Smally, and was used only by him.&nbsp;
                From discussing it with Hugh and from examining the
                instruction's "control pulses", it appears to me that it
                does this:<br>
              </span></span>
            <ul>
              <li>Inhibits interrupts until the next <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>
                instruction (as if a hardware interrupt had been
                encountered).</li>
              <li>Loads the Z register into the ZRUPT register.&nbsp;
                (Incidentally, so far I've seen only a single instance
                of this instruction, in Luminary 131, and the return
                address is never used.)</li>
              <li>Takes the next instruction from address 0 (which
                presumably has been pre-loaded with "<span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">TC <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">something</span></span>").<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The instruction also shoves a couple of register values onto
            the data bus, but does not save them into memory.&nbsp; The
            AGC Monitor (or equivalent external ground support
            equipment) was able to capture these values, but they were
            irrelevant to normal execution.<br>

            that the next instruction countered will be decoded as an
            "extracode" instruction rather than as a "basic"
            instruction.&nbsp; Since only 3 bits are provided within
            instruction words to indicate the instruction type, and yet
            there are more than 8 instruction types, the "extracode"
            method was provided as a means to have 4 bits available to
            indicate instruction types, and thus to extend the number of
            instruction types which can be represented.<br>
            <br>
            The Extracode flag is automatically reset as soon as the
            next instruction after <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">EXTEND</span> is executed, unless the next
            instruction is an <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instruction, in which case the next instruction after the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span> is also
            treated as extracode.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Interrupts are automatically disabled while the Extracode
            flag is set.&nbsp; Thus, there is no need to fear that an
            interrupt will occur between an <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">EXTEND</span> and the instruction following
            it, and hence that the wrong instruction will be affected by
            the <span style="font-family: monospace;">EXTEND</span>.<br>
            <br>
            The encoding of this instruction is a special case of <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC K</span>, in which <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is the address
            00006, however the action is completely unlike other <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span>
            instructions.&nbsp; Note that a normal <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span> instruction to
            address 00006 can be manufactured by means of
            indexing.&nbsp; For example, suppose that some location <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> contains the
            numerical value 6.&nbsp; The following sequence of
            instructions<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:

              <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC A</span><br>
            </div>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> The idea behind this

              <li>Retrieve the value stored in <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>;</li>

              </li>
            </ol>
            This is perhaps best illustrated by an example.&nbsp;
            Suppose that we wanted to form a jump-table, from which
            would could jump to a number of different places in
            memory.&nbsp; The code could look like this:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
                monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # INTO A TO

              </span> </div>
            <br>
            For example, if we loaded the value 3 into the accumulator,
            then the "<span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX A</span>"
            instruction would effectively turn the "<span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC JMPTAB</span>"
            instruction into "<span style="font-family: monospace;">TC
              JMPTAB +3</span>", which would cause a jump to the "<span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TCF LOC3</span>"
            instruction.&nbsp; But the modification to the "<span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC JMPTAB</span>"
            instruction caused by <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            takes place only within the musty recesses of the CPU, and
            not in memory.&nbsp; So the code listed above could be in
            fixed memory, and is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
            self-modifying code.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Note that the usefulness of <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INDEX</span> is not limited to <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span> instructions,
            and applies to every instruction type.&nbsp; Indeed, there
            are cases where the indexing operation is used to change the
            instruction type itself rather than just the operand.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            If <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is the A,
            L, or Q register (i.e., 16-bit registers), the value is
            overflow-corrected before use (though the register itself is
            not modified).<br>
            <br>
            The <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instruction is the only instruction which does not reset the
            extracode flag.&nbsp; The extracode flag, if set by the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">EXTEND</span> instruction,
            will persist through any number of <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instructions.&nbsp; This is useful, of course, for indexing
            multi-dimensional objects such as matrices.<br>
            <br>
            A side-effect of this instruction is that <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is rewritten
            after its value is interrogated; this means that if <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is CYR, SR, CYL,
            or EDOP, then it is re-edited.<br>
            <br>
            It is worth noting that the <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INDEX</span> instruction is the only case
            where <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            intentionally implements functionality significantly
            differently from the true AGC.&nbsp; The true AGC reacts to
            the <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instruction by computing the modified following instruction,
            storing it in the hidden CPU register B, advancing the
            program counter past the following instruction, and then
            executing the instruction it finds in the B register; it
            also allows interrupts to occur prior to executing the code
            in the B register.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>,
            on the other hand, stores the index value itself in a hidden
            CPU register, advances the program counter only to the
            following instruction, and then adds the hidden index value
            to the following instruction when it actually reaches it;
            but it does not allow an interrupt between the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span> and the
            following instruction.&nbsp; (Anyone who objects to this
            difference is free to send me a patch.)<br>
            <br>
            When the basic form of <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INDEX</span> is used (i.e., without a
            preceding <span style="font-family: monospace;">EXTEND</span>),

            the special case of <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>
            being address&nbsp; 017 octal is not an <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span> instruction,
            refer instead to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>
            instruction.&nbsp; The extracode version of <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>, on the other
            hand, is never treated as <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">RESUME</span>.<br>

            Interrupts are automatically disabled during various

            necessary to explicitly use <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">RELINT</span>.&nbsp; This automatically
            disabling of interrupts is completely different from the
            flag manipulated by the <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INHINT</span> and <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">RELINT</span> instructions.&nbsp; These

            The encoding of this instruction is a special case of <span

            instructions.&nbsp; Note that a normal <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span> instruction to
            address 00004 can be manufactured by means of
            indexing.&nbsp; For example, suppose that some location <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> contains the
            numerical value 4.&nbsp; The following sequence of

              <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC A</span><br>
            </div>
            ends up executing an instruction numerically encoded as
            00004 octal, just is the <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INHINT</span> instruction; however, that
            instruction is treated literally as a <span

            addressing location 00004 rather than as an <span

              style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">overflow-adjusted prior to
              the operation</span>.&nbsp; The single-precision (SP)
            contents of <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>
            are then multiplied by the SP contents of the accumulator,
            resulting in a double-precision (DP) value whose
            more-significant word is stored into the accumulator and
            whose less-significant word is stored into the L register.<br>
            <br>
            The sign of the resulting DP value is just what would be
            expected (i.e., positive when multiplying two factors with
            the same sign, and negative when multiplying two factors of
            opposite signs).&nbsp; If one of the factors is 0,
            determining the sign of the result (i.e., +0 or -0) is a
            little trickier, and is done according to the following
            rules:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>The result is +0, unless</li>
              <li>The factor in the accumulator had been ±0 and the
                factor in <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>
                had been non-zero of the opposite sign, in which case
                the result is -0.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            The sign of the value placed in the L register is set to
            agree with the sign of the value placed in the accumulator.<br>
            <br>
            It is important to remember that the AGC's SP and DP values
            represent numbers between (but not including) -1 and
            +1.&nbsp; Therefore, the result of a multiplication is
            always less than either of the factors which are multiplied
            together.&nbsp; While you can work with numbers larger than
            1, such as calculating 2×2, the scaling of the the factors
            and the result must be carefully considered.&nbsp; For
            example, if you wanted to use the <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">MP</span> instruction with A and <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> each containing
            the octal value 2 (which would really be the SP value 2×2<sup>-14</sup>),

            then you would indeed find a result of 4, but it would be in
            L register because it would be part of the DP value 4×2<sup>-28</sup>
            rather than just the integer 4.<br>
            <br>
            For the special case "<span style="font-family: monospace;">MP

              A</span>", refer instead to the <span style="font-family:

              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> are subtracted
            from the accumulator.&nbsp; Both A and <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> are assumed to
            contain 2's-complement unsigned values prior to the
            calculation.&nbsp; The result of the subtraction (in the
            accumulator) is converted to a 1's-complement value.&nbsp;
            If <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is the
            16-bit Q register, then 16-bit values are used in the
            calculation; otherwise, the overflow-corrected value from A
            is used, and the result is sign-extended to 16 bit before
            storing it back into A.<br>
            <br>
            The point of this instruction is that the CDU counters (see
            above) monitor gimbal angles in 2's-complement form, yet the
            CPU can only perform general calculations in 1's-complement
            form.&nbsp; This instruction thus provides a way to convert
            differences of gimbal angles to a form in which further
            calculation can be done.<br>
            <br>
            A side-effect of this instruction is that <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is rewritten
            (with its original value) after the calculation; this means
            that if <span style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is
            CYR, SR, CYL, or EDOP, then it is re-edited.<br>

            is assembled differently, depending on whether it is found
            in erasable memory or in fixed memory.&nbsp; In erasable
            memory, it assembles as "<span style="font-family:
              monospace;">CA A</span>" (i.e, as "load the accumulator

            next instruction.&nbsp; The latter method is apparently
            considered preferable, because it requires less CPU cycles,
            but cannot be used in erasable memory because the <span

            only target locations in fixed memory.&nbsp; Of course, "<span

            be used in fixed memory by coding it directly rather than
            using the generic <span style="font-family: monospace;">NOOP</span>
            instruction.&nbsp; (Of course, these issues really relate to
            the assembler, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>,
            rather than the CPU, since the CPU will execute whatever

          </td>
          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> This instruction is used to
            return from an interrupt-service routine.&nbsp; Interrupt
            vectoring automatically copies the contents of the current
            instruction pointer (Z register) into the ZRUPT register and
            copies the contents of the memory location pointed to by the
            Z register (in other words, the value of the current
            instruction) into the BRUPT register.&nbsp; Thus, in order
            to resume after interrupt, the <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">RESUME</span> instruction copies the ZRUPT
            register back to the Z register and then causes the
            instruction stored in the BRUPT register to be executed <span
              style="font-style: italic;">as if</span> it were stored in
            memory at the location pointed to by Z.<br>
            <br>
            This oddity of executing the instruction stored in the BRUPT
            allows the programmer to execute an arbitrary instruction
            upon return from interrupt, rather than executing the
            instruction originally appearing in the program flow.&nbsp;
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Obviously, you never want
              to do this</span>.&nbsp; While theoretically providing
            this capability, the BRUPT register actually exists for the
            purpose of holding instructions which have been altered by a
            preceding <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instruction, but which have not yet been executed when the
            interrupt vectoring occurs.&nbsp; This was necessary in the
            true AGC, because the AGC allowed interrupts to occur
            between an <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instruction and the instruction affected by the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span> instruction,
            and thus it was necessary to stored the indexed instruction
            somehow, so that it could be executed when normal operation
            resumed after the interrupt.&nbsp; <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> does not allow
            interrupts following an <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INDEX</span> instruction, and conflicts
            between <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            and the interrupt system do not arise in <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp; However,
            the BRUPT register continues to be supported by <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.<br>
            <br>
            The <span style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>
            instruction is a special case of <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INDEX</span>, in which <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span> is the address
            00017, but the action is completely unlike other <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instructions.&nbsp; (The logic of using address 00017, by
            the way, is that address 00017 is the BRUPT register; see
            above.)&nbsp; Note that a normal <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">INDEX</span> instruction to address 00017 can
            itself be manufactured by means of indexing.&nbsp; For
            example, suppose that some location <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K1</span> contains the
            numerical value 00000 and&nbsp; <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">K2</span> is the address 00017 octal.&nbsp;
            The instruction sequence<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
                monospace;">INDEX K2</span><br style="font-family:

              <span style="font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">Some


                instruction</span><br>
            </div>
            would not index the final instruction as shown, because "<span
              style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX K2</span>" would be
            interpreted as <span style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>
            rather than as an <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instruction.&nbsp; However, the sequence of instructions<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
                monospace;">INDEX K1</span><br style="font-family:
                monospace;">
              <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX K2<br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Some instruction</span><br>
              </span> </div>
            converts "<span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX K2</span>"
            into a literal <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
            instruction rather than allowing it to be reinterpreted as <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>, and thus
            does index the final instruction.&nbsp; On the other hand,
            and probably more logically, the first code sequence shown
            would have worked to index the instruction if preceded by an
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">EXTEND</span>
            instruction, since <span style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>
            is a basic instruction and not an extracode instruction.<br>
            <br>
            Note that any useful interrupt service routine would modify
            the A register (and probably the L, Q, and BB
            registers).&nbsp; Registers called ARUPT, LRUPT, QRUPT, and
            BBRUPT are dedicated to holding register values during the
            interrupt service routine, yet the act of vectoring to the
            interrupt <span style="font-style: italic;">does not</span>
            automatically A, L, Q, and BB to ARUPT, LRUPT, QRUPT, and
            BBRUPT.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Nor does
              the RESUME instruction restore A, L, Q, and BB from ARUPT,
              LRUPT, QRUPT, and BBRUPT</span>.&nbsp; Consequently, most
            useful interrupt service routines will need to begin by
            saving A, L, Q, and BB, and will need to end by restoring
            them prior to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">RESUME</span>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="text-decoration:
              underline;">Nesting of subroutine calls</span>:&nbsp; The
            AGC is not stack-based, and does not automatically support
            nesting of subroutines.&nbsp; Only one level of
            subroutine-calls is supported directly by the CPU.&nbsp;
            Thus, each use of a <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span>
            instruction destroys the subroutine-return which has been
            set up by prior <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span>
            instructions.&nbsp; If additional levels are required, the
            program must specifically allocate storage and save/restore
            the subroutine-return information (from/to the Q register).<br>
            <br>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indirect jumps</span>:&nbsp;

            The <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span>
            instruction may also be used to accomplish an indirect jump
            (i.e., a jump to a computed rather than a hard-coded
            address) by first loading the A register with the desired
            12-bit address, and then using the instruction <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC A</span>.&nbsp; Note,
            though, that this will be an indirect <span
              style="font-style: italic;">jump</span> to the address,
            rather than an indirect <span style="font-style: italic;">call</span>
            to the address.<br>
            <br>
            The reason the latter trick works is a side-effect of the
            fact that the instruction <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">TC K</span> assembles to the octal value <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">K</span>.&nbsp; When an
            instruction like <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC A</span>
            is executed, the CPU does not actually load the program
            counter with the contents of the A register, as we might
            suppose.&nbsp; Instead, it literally calls the subroutine at
            memory location 0 (since the A register has address 0), and
            what it finds at address 0 is coincidentally another <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span>
            instruction.&nbsp; A return from the subroutine is not
            correctly set up in this case because the return which is
            set up is for the <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span>
            instruction at address 0, rather than for the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC A</span> instruction
            that started the chain of events.&nbsp; Thus, the Q register
            will contain a value of 1.&nbsp; Incidentally, it should
            also be obvious that <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC

              A</span> will require 2 MCT of CPU time instead of the 1
            MCT quoted earlier, since it actually results in <span
              style="font-style: italic;">two</span> <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span> instructions
            being executed.<br>
            <br>
            A similar but subtly different effect occurs when using the
            "<span style="font-family: monospace;">TC Q</span>"
            instruction to return from a subroutine.&nbsp; Refer to the
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">RETURN</span>

            with a <span style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span>

            chosen at runtime, without otherwise interrupting program
            flow.&nbsp; The way this would be done is to:<br>
            <ol>

              <li>Use the <span style="font-family: monospace;">XLQ</span>
                instruction, which will jump to address 00001 (octal)
                after automatically loading a return address into the Q
                register.&nbsp; Thus, the CPU will subsequently execute
                the basic instruction at 00001, and then will return (as
                if from a subroutine) because of the <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span> instruction
                it finds in the Q register at address 00002.&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
              <li>If this complete sequence occurs as described, the Q
                register will be left containing the value 00003, as is
                typical for subroutine returns.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            Apollo documentation like Blair-Smith or Savage&amp;Drake
            quote the timing of this instruction as 2 MCT, by lumping
            together the timing of the <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">XLQ</span> and the terminating <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">TC</span> instruction (at
            address 00002), but obviously the timing of the instruction
            differs in no way from any other <span style="font-family:
              monospace;">TC</span> instruction.<br>
            <br>
            Blair-Smith implies that the following sequence is preferred

    <h2><a name="Pseudo-Operations" id="Pseudo-Operations"></a>Pseudo-Operations</h2>
    <h3>=</h3>
    Used to assign an alternate name to data:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Name</span>
      = <span style="font-style: italic;">Data</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The <span style="font-style: italic;">Data</span> may be either an
    octal or decimal integer constant or else another symbolic name. The
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Name</span> has the same
    constraints as a program label: any 8 characters, excluding '#' or
    leading '$'.<br>
    <br>
    See also the <span style="font-family: monospace;">EQUALS</span>
    pseudo-op, which does essentially the same thing. Page 95 of the
    program listing for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    131 attempts to describe the difference between the two. Its says
    that "=" is used to assign an alternate name to data ("logical
    equivalence"), whereas <span style="font-family: monospace;">EQUALS</span>
    implies sharing of resources—such as reuse of the same memory
    location for two different variables. While interesting from the
    standpoint of maintainers of the code, there is no actual behavioral
    difference between the two pseudo-operations, as far as I can
    determine.<br>
    <br>
    An optional field after <span style="font-style: italic;">Data</span>
    may be added, separated by whitespace, consisting of a positive or
    negative octal constant. (For example, "<span style="font-family:
      monospace;">MYNAME = YOURNAME +1</span>". ) This essentially means
    to add the number to <span style="font-style: italic;">Data</span>.<br>
    <br>
    One sometimes sees "=" used with the <span style="font-style:
      italic;">Data</span> field, but without a <span
      style="font-style: italic;">Name</span>. I believe that statements
    of this kind are placed in the source code entirely for
    documentation purposes, and do not have any effect. An example would
    be something like this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;"># Example of names for bits in a register.</span><br
        style="font-family: monospace;">
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">FIFORDY = 1</span><br
        style="font-family: monospace;">
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">FIFOFUL = 2</span><br
        style="font-family: monospace;">
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


        = 4</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">FIFOHAF = 8</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    In this example, "<span style="font-family: monospace;">= 4</span>"
    has been added simply for maintenance purposes to let everyone know
    that it has been excluded by design rather than by accident.<br>
    <h3>1DNADR, -1DNADR<br>
    </h3>
    This is a "special downlink opcode" that appears only in downlink
    lists rather than in normal instruction flow or in interpretive
    instruction flow.&nbsp; Basically, these instructions as a group are
    used to form a kind of script describing the data which is supposed
    to be transmitted in a downlink packet.&nbsp; A downlink list
    consists of a sequence of these special downlink opcodes (<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">1DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">2DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">3DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">4DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">5DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">6DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">DNCHAN</span>, or <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">DNPTR</span>), terminated by the
    complement of one of them (symbolized by <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">-1DNADR</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">-2DNADR</span>,
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">-3DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">-4DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">-5DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">-6DNADR</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">-DNCHAN</span>, or <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">-DNPTR</span>).&nbsp; The basic
    syntax is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">1DNADR</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel<br>
      </span> or<span style="font-style: italic; font-family:
        monospace;"><br>
      </span> <span style="font-family: monospace;">-1DNADR</span> <span
        style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel<br>
      </span> </div>
    <br>
    The specific interpretation is that the two words located at <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel</span>
    should be transmitted.&nbsp; The "instruction" is actually treated
    by the assembler the identically to the <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">ECADR</span> pseudo-op.&nbsp; The terminating form of
    the instruction (<span style="font-family: monospace;">-1DNADR</span>)
    is logically complemented.<br>
    <h3>2DEC, 2DEC*<br>
    </h3>
    This pseudo-op can be used to embed a double-precision (DP)
    constant. &nbsp; See also the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DEC</span>
    pseudo-op. The basic syntax is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">2DEC</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">DoublePrecisionNumber</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    This may be preceded by a label (starting in column 1) and/or
    followed by a comment. The <span style="font-style: italic;">DoublePrecisionNumber</span>
    is as defined earlier (with optional scaling factors). Recall that
    the DP format represents fractional positive or negative numbers, so
    only numbers less than +1 and greater than -1 are theoretically
    acceptable. An example would be "<span style="font-family:
      monospace;">2DEC +.4928</span>". Since this assembles as a DP
    number, two 15-bit words are created, and <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaYUL</span>'s internal position counter is incremented by
    two.<br>
    <br>
    If the <span style="font-style: italic;">DoublePrecisionNumber</span>
    contains no decimal point, the number is assembled in integer format
    rather than in DP format if no "En" or "Bn" option is present. Or to
    look at it a little differently, an implied B-28 option is added.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, a variation of which the following is an example appears
    very frequently: "<span style="font-family: monospace;">2DEC* +656.0
      E-4 B3*</span>". This variation assembles to the same octal words
    as if the '*' characters were not present.&nbsp; The purpose is
    apparently to allow the operand fields to extend into the columns
    reserved by <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span> for
    comments.&nbsp; In other words, the comment field begins only after
    the trailing '*'.&nbsp; Recall that the original assembler, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>, processed source code
    supplied on punch cards, and that the syntax of the source code was
    column-aligned.&nbsp; However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
    allows free-form source code which is not column-aligned, with
    comments that are delimited by the special character '#', and hence
    has no need for this particular construct.&nbsp; (Thanks to Julian
    Webb for this explanation!)<br>
    <h3>2DNADR, -2DNADR<br>
    </h3>
    This is a "special downlink opcode"; refer to the comments for the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">1DNADR</span> pseudo-op.&nbsp; The
    basic syntax is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">2DNADR</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel<br>

        style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;"><span
          style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel<br>
        </span><br>
      </span> </div>
    The specific interpretation is that the four words located at <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel</span>
    should be transmitted.&nbsp; The "instruction" is actually treated
    by the assembler the identically to the <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">ECADR</span> pseudo-op, except that the value 04000
    (octal) is added.&nbsp; The terminating form of the instruction (<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">-2DNADR</span>) is logically
    complemented.
    <h3>2FCADR</h3>
    This pseudo-op can be used to embed a double-word constant, to be
    used later by the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DTCF</span>
    instruction. &nbsp; The basic syntax is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">2FCADR</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">ProgramLabel</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The double-word which is formed contains a first word that is
    suitable for loading into the FB register (i.e., it contains the
    suitably-shifted fixed-bank number of the <span style="font-style:
      italic; font-family: monospace;">ProgramLabel</span>), while the
    second word contains a value suitable for loading into the Z
    register.&nbsp; In other words, the net effect of the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">DTCF</span> instruction below is
    to jump to <span style="font-family: monospace;">MYLABEL</span>,
    changing fixed banks as appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">MYJUMP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span> </div>
    <br>
    Of course, this method cannot by itself account for
    jump-destinations in memory banks 40-43, since this would require
    manipulation of the superbank bit in i/o channel 7 in addition to
    manipulations of the FB registers.&nbsp; Thus, the superbank bit in
    channel 7 must be explicitly set in advance if the destination is in
    banks 40-43.<br>
    <br>
    Actually, the rules for forming the two embedded words is somewhat
    more complicated, as the discussion above was simplified in order to
    illustrate a typical use.&nbsp; The first word contains not only
    FB's bank bits (in bit positions 15-11), but also the 10-bit offset
    into that bank (in bits 10-1).&nbsp; (The latter bits are
    automatically discarded when loaded into FB.)&nbsp; If the address
    is in fixed-fixed memory, then either bank 2 or bank 3 is chosen, as
    appropriate. &nbsp;&nbsp; The second word contains the same value
    that would have resulted from assembling the instruction "<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">TC ProgramLabel</span>".<br>
    <h3>3DNADR, -3DNADR<br>
    </h3>
    This is a "special downlink opcode"; refer to the comments for the <span

      </span> </div>
    The specific interpretation is that the six words located at <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel</span>
    should be transmitted.&nbsp; The "instruction" is actually treated
    by the assembler the identically to the <span style="font-family:

    <h3>BANK</h3>
    This directive is used in two different ways. When followed by a
    number such as<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">BANK 5</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    it means that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>'s
    internal location counter should be repositioned to the first <span
      style="font-style: italic;">unused</span> location of fixed-memory
    bank 5.&nbsp; Only fixed-memory banks (and not erasable-memory
    banks) are supported in this way. The bank numbers range from 0 to
    43 (octal) . (Bank numbers 0-37 octal are in "super-bank 0", while
    bank numbers 40-43 octal&nbsp; are in "super-bank 1".)<br>
    <br>
    If <span style="font-family: monospace;">BANK</span> is used
    without the numerical operand,<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">BANK</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    then the location counter is moved to the first unused location in
    the <span style="font-style: italic;">current</span> fixed-memory
    bank.<br>
    <h3>BLOCK</h3>
    This directive is similar to <span style="font-family: monospace;">BANK</span>.
    However, it applies only to "unswitched erasable" memory, which is
    BLOCK 0 (address 0), and to "fixed-fixed" memory, which contains
    BLOCK 2 (address 4000 octal) and BLOCK 3 (address 6000 octal).&nbsp;
    From the pattern of addresses, I suppose it this directive might be
    generalized to any multiple of&nbsp; octal 2000, but I have not
    chosen to do so.<br>
    <h3>BNKSUM</h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> simply silenty
    discards this directive. It appears not to have any effect other
    than printing a count of the number of words used in the current
    memory bank. A table appears at the end of the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> output listing which
    contains this information anyway.&nbsp; It very likely had the
    side-effect of forcing <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>
    to add the bugger word to the end of the memory bank.&nbsp; (<span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> automatically adds the
    bugger word, hence no particular command is needed to force it to do
    so.)<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">BNKSUM</span><br>
    </div>
    <h3>COUNT, COUNT*</h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> simply silently
    discards these directives. Typically one of them appeared on the
    next line of source-code following a <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">BANK</span> pseudo-op. Their original intent (in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>) seems to have been to
    indicate that the code which followed it should be included within
    the word counts for a specific subroutine. (In other words, so that
    you could get a table in the output listing saying that function X
    used Y words of memory.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
    generates no such tables.) The directive did not seem to generate
    binary code, nor to affect generation of binary code.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">COUNT <span style="font-style: italic;">Banknum</span>/<span
          style="font-style: italic;">ProgramLabel</span><br>
      </span> or<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
        COUNT* $$/<span style="font-style: italic;">ProgramLabel<br>
        </span></span>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> <br>
        The latter form does not require a memory-bank number because it
        assumes the current bank (as defined by the preceding <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">BANK</span> pseudo-op).<br>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>DEC, DEC*<br>
    </h3>
    This pseudo-op can be used to embed a single-precision (SP)
    constant.&nbsp; Except for the fact that it assembles as one 15-bit
    word rather than as two 15-bit words, it is essentially the same as
    the <span style="font-family: monospace;">2DEC</span> pseudo-op.<br>
    <h3>DNCHAN, -DNCHAN<br>
    </h3>
    This is a "special downlink opcode"; refer to the comments for the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">1DNADR</span> pseudo-op.&nbsp; The
    basic syntax is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">DNCHAN</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">IoChannelNumber<br>
      </span> or<span style="font-style: italic; font-family:
        monospace;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family:
          monospace;"><br>
        </span></span> <span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">-DNCHAN</span></span> <span
        style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;"><span
          style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">IoChannelNumber<br>
        </span><br>
      </span> </div>
    The specific runtime interpretation, I believe, is that the value of
    the selected i/o channel is read and inserted in the transmission
    stream.&nbsp; The "instruction" is compiled as the channel number,
    except that the value 34000 (octal) is added.&nbsp; The terminating
    form of the instruction (<span style="font-family: monospace;">-DNCHAN</span>)
    is logically complemented.
    <h3>DNPTR, -DNPTR<br>
    </h3>
    This is a "special downlink opcode"; refer to the comments for the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">1DNADR</span> pseudo-op.&nbsp; The
    basic syntax is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">DNPTR</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel<br>
      </span> or<span style="font-style: italic; font-family:
        monospace;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family:
          monospace;"><br>
        </span></span> <span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">-DNPTR</span></span> <span
        style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;"><span
          style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel<br>
        </span><br>
      </span> </div>
    The specific runtime interpretation is that <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">AddressLabel</span>
    points to another downlink list.&nbsp; (I suppose that this other
    downlink list is inserted in the transmission stream, but I'm not
    really sure.)&nbsp; The "instruction" is actually treated by the
    assembler the identically to the <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">ADRES</span> pseudo-op, except that the value 30000
    (octal) is added.&nbsp; The terminating form of the instruction (<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">-DNPTR</span>) is logically
    complemented.
    <h3>EBANK=</h3>
    This pseudo-op generates no code. Rather, it changes the assumptions
    of the assembler as to the erasable bank being used. In most cases,
    the assembler uses knowledge of the current erasable bank only for
    generating error messages about addressing incompatibilities.
    However, it also uses the information directly for the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">BBCON</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">2BCADR</span>, and <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">2CADR</span> pseudo-ops.<br>
    <br>
    Normally, the `<span style="font-family: monospace;">EBANK=</span>'
    setting persists until a new <span style="font-family: monospace;">EBANK=</span>
    (or a <span style="font-family: monospace;">SETLOC</span> with a
    target in erasable memory) is encountered. However, if a <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">BBCON</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">2BCADR</span>, or <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">2CADR</span> pseudo-op immediately
    follows the <span style="font-family: monospace;">EBANK=</span>
    line, then the E-bank assumption applies only to that one pseudo-op
    and then immediately reverts to its previous setting.<br>
    <h3>EQUALS</h3>
    Used to assign a symbolic name to a value:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Symbol</span>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">EQUALS</span> <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Value</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The <span style="font-style: italic;">Value</span> may be either an
    octal or decimal integer, or else another symbolic name. The <span
      style="font-style: italic;">Symbol</span> has the same constraints
    as a program label: any 8 characters, excluding '#' or leading '$'.<br>
    <br>
    Note that if the <span style="font-style: italic;">Value</span> is
    a symbolic name, it need not have been previously defined. In other
    words, forward-references are allowed: the operand symbol may be
    defined later in the source code. The assembler will make as many
    passes as necessary to resolve all symbol references.<br>
    <br>
    See also the "=" pseudo-op, which has similar functionality. Page 95
    of the program listing for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    131 attempts to describe the difference between the two. Its says
    that "=" is used to assign an alternate name to data ("logical
    equivalence"), whereas <span style="font-family: monospace;">EQUALS</span>
    implies sharing of resources—such as reuse of the same memory
    location for two different variables.<br>
    <br>
    An optional field after <span style="font-style: italic;">Value</span>
    may be added, separated by whitespace, consisting of a positive or
    negative octal constant. For example, "<span style="font-family:
      monospace;">MYNAME EQUALS YOURNAME +1</span>". This essentially
    means to add the number to <span style="font-style: italic;">Value</span>.<br>
    <br>
    One sometimes sees <span style="font-family: monospace;">EQUALS</span>
    used with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Symbol</span>
    field, but without the <span style="font-style: italic;">Value</span>
    field. The effect of this is to use the value of the assembler's
    current internal location counter.<br>
    <h3>ERASE</h3>
    Skips a location in erasable memory:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">ERASE</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    In other words, particularly if preceded by a label (in column 1),
    allocates a word of memory in which to store a variable.
    Alternately, we can use the syntax:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">ERASE</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">n</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    where <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> is an octal or
    decimal integer constant. This skips <span style="font-style:
      italic;">n</span>+1 bytes of erasable memory.<br>
    <br>
    The following syntax is also accepted:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">ERASE</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">m</span> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">-</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">n</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    This isn't really like the other <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">ERASE</span> commands, as it operates identically to "<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">SETLOC <span style="font-style:
        italic;">m</span></span>" and has no effect on the assembler's
    location counter. The net effect is to set the label of the line (if
    any) to <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">m</span>.&nbsp;

    The <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">n</span>
    operand is discarded, and is present principally for documentation
    purposes.<br>
    <h3>MEMORY</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">MEMORY</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">m</span> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">-</span> <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: monospace;">n</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Like "<span style="font-family: monospace;">ERASE <span
        style="font-style: italic;">m - n</span></span>", this operates
    identically to "<span style="font-family: monospace;">SETLOC <span
        style="font-style: italic;">m</span></span>" and has no effect
    on the assembler's location counter. The net effect is to set the
    label of the line (if any) to <span style="font-style: italic;
      font-family: monospace;">m</span>.&nbsp; The <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">n</span>
    operand is discarded, and is present principally for documentation
    purposes.
    <h3>OCT</h3>
    This pseudo-op can be used to embed an octal constant. In other
    words,<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">OCT</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">OctalNumber</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    simply places a 15-bit word equal to <span style="font-style:
      italic;">OctalNumber</span> (which is a number of up to 5 digits,
    using only the digits 0-7) directly into the byte stream.<br>
    <h3><a name="SECSIZ" id="SECSIZ"></a>SECSIZ</h3>
    <p>(Versions 2016-09-29 and later.)&nbsp; This is an experimental
      concept for a new pseudo-op not present in the original AGC code,
      but which could be possibly be of value in the process of
      transcribing hard-copies or scanned AGC assembly listings to ASCII
      source code that can be assembled later with <b>yaYUL</b>.&nbsp;
      It provides a way to instruct the assembler, after <tt>SETLOC</tt>,
      <tt>BANK</tt>, or <tt>BLOCK</tt> pseudo-ops have been used, how
      many words that section of memory will contain before the <i>next</i>
      <tt>SETLOC</tt>, <tt>BANK</tt>, or <tt>BLOCK</tt> pseudo-op is
      encountered.&nbsp; What this does is to allow the assembler to
      potentially assemble AGC source code which has only been partially
      transcribed, but to still locate all symbols and code at their
      proper locations in memory in spite of that (though not
      necessarily with their proper numerical values, since not all
      operands may be resolvable).&nbsp; After the code has been entered
      completely, the <tt>SECSIZ</tt> pseudo-ops can be either retained
      or discarded without affecting the assembly process.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If a <tt>BANK</tt> pseudo-op is used together with a <tt>SETLOC</tt>,
      then <tt>SECSIZ</tt> must follow the <tt>BANK</tt> rather than
      the <tt>SETLOC</tt>. Here is an example of usage, with
      alternating uses of block 2 and block 3.&nbsp; Arbitrary <tt>SECSIZ</tt>
      pseudo-ops have been added, but you can see that whenever a switch
      is made back to block 2 or 3 from block 3 or 2, an amount of space
      equivalent to the <tt>SECSIZ</tt> has been allocated, rather than
      just the space needed for the instructions explicitly present:<br>

    <h3>SETLOC</h3>
    This pseudo-op changes the value of the position counter being used
    by the assembler:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">SETLOC</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Address</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    In other words, the next instruction or pseudo-op assembled will be
    placed at address <span style="font-style: italic;">Address</span>.
    The <span style="font-style: italic;">Address</span> field is
    either an octal constant, or else a symbol which the assembler can
    resolve as an address. If the <span style="font-style: italic;">Address</span>
    is numeric, it will be treated as a pseudo-address—i.e., it must be
    in the range 0-117777 (octal)—and the assembler will determine
    automatically what memory space to place it in. In most cases this
    determination is unambiguous, but in some cases there are two
    possible choices. For example, address 4000 (octal)&nbsp; is in both
    "fixed-fixed" memory and in bank 2 of "common fixed" memory.&nbsp;
    In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">SETLOC</span> will always choose
    ""fixed-fixed over ""common-fixed memory, and it will always choose
    "unswitched "erasable over "switched "erasable memory.&nbsp; Very
    often <span style="font-family: monospace;">SETLOC</span> will be
    followed (on the next line of the source file) by the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">BANK</span> pseudo-op when <span
      style="font-style: italic;">Address</span> is the beginning of a
    bank in fixed-memory.<br>
    <h3>SUBRO</h3>
    This is simply discarded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>.&nbsp;

    Its original purpose (in <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>)
    was seemingly to help maintain a list of subroutines for later
    printout, for documentation purposes.&nbsp; <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> maintains no such list and
    prints no such report.<br>

    <h2><a name="Interpreter_Instruction_Set"
        id="Interpreter_Instruction_Set"></a>Interpreter Instruction Set</h2>
    <h3>Source Code and Encoding<br>
    </h3>
    Interpreter source code is written in a very odd way, reflecting the
    underlying implementation in which two interpreter opcodes are
    normally encoded within a single word of memory, although sometimes
    only a single interpreter opcode is stored within a word of
    memory.&nbsp; Interpreter opcodes take either 0, 1, or 2 operands,
    and these operands are written on the lines <span
      style="font-style: italic;">following</span> the opcodes.&nbsp;
    Therefore, a source line representing one or two interpreter opcodes
    may be followed by 0 to 4 lines containing the operands (each of
    which assembles to a single word of memory).&nbsp; For example, here
    are some typical cases:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">OPCODE1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          OPERAND1<br>
          OPCODE1&nbsp;&nbsp; OPCODE2<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          OPERAND1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          OPERAND2<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          OPERAND3<br>
          OPCODE1&nbsp;&nbsp; OPCODE2<br>
        </span></span> </div>
    <br>
    In general, each opcode is numerically encoded as a 7-bit
    value.&nbsp; The first opcode is stored in bits 7-1 of the 15-bit
    word, while the second opcode is stored in bits 14-8.&nbsp; More
    precisely, the 7-bit codes from the following table are <span
      style="font-style: italic;">incremented</span>, and then stored in
    bit fields 7-1 or 14-8 (the fields remain 0 if there is no opcode
    stored there), and then the entire word is logically
    complemented.&nbsp; For example, consider<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">VSL1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VAD</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    VSL1 is coded as 004 octal, and VAD is coded as 121 octal, so the
    entire line is encoded as the logical complement of
    200*(121+1)+(4+1)=24405, or 53372.<br>
    <br>
    The exceptions to this scheme are the <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">STCALL</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">STODL</span>,
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">STORE</span>, and <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">STOVL</span> instructions, which
    have either one or two operands, but the first operand is written
    (and encoded) on the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span>
    line as the opcode.&nbsp; For example:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">STOVL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style:
          italic;">OPERAND1</span><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
          style="font-style: italic;">OPERNAD2</span><br>
      </span> </div>
    <br>
    Another special case is if one of these four instructions is
    immediately preceded by the <span style="font-family: monospace;">STADR</span>
    instruction.&nbsp; In this case the entire 15-bit word is logically
    complemented.<br>
    <br>
    Encoding of operands is also pretty tricky.&nbsp; Rather than repeat
    these tricky rules over and over in the opcode table below, I'll
    define the encoding formats here and give them convenient
    identifying names.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operands in erasable
      memory.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll represent the numerical values
    created by the encoding as <span style="font-family: monospace;">e(X)</span>,
    which is defined as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Unswitched erasable:&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family:
          monospace;">e(X) = X</span></li>
      <li>Switched erasable:&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family:
          monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">e(X) = 0400
            * <span style="font-style: italic;">ErasableBankNumOfX</span>
            + (X - 1400)</span></span></li>
    </ul>
    (All of the constants are octal.)&nbsp; For example, E7,1764 would
    encode to 0400*7+(1764-1400)=3764.&nbsp; Incidentally, note that
    since unswitched erasable memory can alternately be addressed as
    switched erasable memory in banks E0, E1, or E2, the second rule
    actually suffices for all cases.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operands in fixed memory.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    These encode to 15-bit values, and can be used to represent any
    address in fixed-memory banks 00-37.&nbsp; (Superbanks 40-43 are not
    accesible to the interpreter.)&nbsp; I'll designate this rule by <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">f(X)</span>, defined as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed-fixed:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">f(X)
          = X</span></li>
      <li>Common-fixed:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">f(X)

          = 02000 * <span style="font-style: italic;">FixedBankNumOfX</span>
          + (X - 02000)</span><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Again, all of the constants are octal, and because of the way
    fixed-fixed memory corresponds to common-fixed memory banks 02 and
    03, the second rule actually suffices for all cases.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operands representing
      switches.</span>&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> each employ a
    large array of single-bit values ("switches" or "flagwords") to
    store status information of various kinds.&nbsp; Some of the
    interpreter instructions operate on these switches.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    flagwords themselves are identified by the switch word in which they
    reside (0-77 octal), and by the bit-position within the word (0-16
    octal).&nbsp; The encoding of these flagword operands is more
    complex than that of pure addresses.&nbsp; If the bits of the
    encoded word are identified as <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">0WWWWWWNNNNBBBB</span>, then <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">WWWWWW</span> is the switch-word
    number and <span style="font-family: monospace;">BBBB</span> is the
    bit-position number within the word.&nbsp; The field <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">NNNN</span> is the "operation
    number", and therefore includes part of the information we'd
    probably expect to find in the opcode, thus resulting in the
    situation that many of the operations on switch operands actually
    have the same numerical opcode.&nbsp; The values for the <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">NNNN</span> fields are listed in
    the opcode table below.<br>
    <br>
    As I mentioned above, the <span style="font-family: monospace;">STCALL</span>,
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">STODL</span>, <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">STORE</span>, and <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">STOVL</span> instructions are
    special cases in some sense, and the table below summarizes what I
    was able to learn about them.&nbsp; In the table, items in brackets
    are optional.&nbsp; For example, <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">[Y]</span> might indicate an optional operand (called
    "<span style="font-family: monospace;">Y</span>").<br>

    <h3><a name="MarkSchulman"></a>Mark Schulman's Gloss<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Actually — confession time! — the truth is that I (Ron Burkey)
      have spent very little time figuring out what the various
      interpreter instructions do, so I can't really say much more about
      them than I've said above.&nbsp; Fortunately, Mark Schulman
      (thanks, Mark!) has stepped in to fill in the gaps and provide a
      pretty comprehensive explanation of how it all works.&nbsp; This
      entire section, which I've turned <font color="#663300">brown</font>
      to make it stand out, has been written by Mark with only minimal
      editing (for format) by me.&nbsp; I'm sure there's some overlap
      with what I said about the interpreter above, but I've made no
      attempt to edit Mark's content.&nbsp; At any rate, I'll turn it
      over to Mark here:<br>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#663300">Because the AGC used a 3-bit opcode, the
        number of instructions was limited. The hardware designers used
        various tricks (such as the EXTEND instruction) to increase the
        number of opcodes </font><font color="#663300">— there were 40
      </font><font color="#663300">— but the AGC's instruction set was
        still limited. Additionally, important operations (such as trig
        functions and vector manipulation) are not supported by the
        hardware, which meant that performing navigation calculations
        required an enormous number of subroutine calls.</font></p>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">To solve these problems, as well as get
        around the general unwieldiness of writing large programs for
        the AGC, the developers implemented an interpreter that
        simulated a computer that was an easier and more natural fit for
        navigation calculations. The machine simulated by the
        Interpreter is quite different from the AGC, with its own set of
        registers, more powerful instructions, and a different memory
        model.</font></p>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">The result is that some software in the AGC
        is written using the AGC's native instructions, and some of the
        software is written using the instructions that are understood
        by the Interpreter. YUL (the assembler) understands both sets of
        instructions, but it is up to the programmer to use the proper
        instructions at the proper place in the code, as described
        below.</font></p>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">The Interpreter includes these features:</font></p>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#663300"><b>Wider variety of instructions.</b>
          The Interpreter provided a much wider variety of instructions,
          including instructions for trig functions and vector
          manipulation. Writing code using the Interpreter's
          instructions made it easier and more natural to write
          navigation code, and yielded more compact code.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><b>Simpler memory model.</b> The AGC
          hardware uses a complex and cumbersome banking scheme to
          access memory. The Interpreter enables the programmer to treat
          memory more like a flat memory space, without having to deal
          with banking registers.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><b>Easier number handling.</b> The
          Interpreter deals much more easily with a variety of numerical
          types without forcing the programmer to do explicit
          conversions.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><b>Vectors.</b> The Interpreter provides
          instructions for dealing with vectors, a crucial component of
          navigational software.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><b>Memory structures.</b> The
          Interpreter provides useful memory structures, such as stacks
          and switches, which the AGC hardware lacks.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">The software that implements the
        Interpreter occupies most of fixed bank 00, some of 01, and some
        fixed-fixed memory.</font></p>

    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">A machine-code program starts a block of
        interpreted code by calling the INTPRET subroutine with this
        assembler instruction:</font></p>

    <div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;; margin-left: 1em"><font

      </font></div>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">The Interpreter expects the TC INTPRET
        instruction to be immediately followed by a block of Interpeter
        code. The Interpreter reads and executes this code until it
        encounters an EXIT Interpreter instruction. The Interpreter
        assumes that the memory word following the EXIT instruction is
        an AGC machine instruction, and execution continues immediately
        after the EXIT.
      </font></p>
    <p><font color="#663300">The typical structure of a program
        containing Interpreter code looks like this:</font></p>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>

      </font>
    </div>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">It is vitally important that a programmer
        use the appropriate instructions in the appropriate context. If
        a programmer uses an Interpreter instruction in the middle of
        AGC code without starting the Interpreter, the AGC will
        misinterpret the instruction. Similarly, if a programmer uses a
        native AGC instruction inside a block of Interpreter code, a
        similar misinterpretation will occur.</font></p>
    <font color="#663300">
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663300">An interpreted program can call a machine
        code subroutine by executing an RTB instruction (which branches
        to a machine code location). The RTB instruction stores a return
        address in the Interpreter. When the machine code subroutine has
        finished executing, it returns to the interpreted code by
        executing this instruction:</font></p>

    [Ron's note:&nbsp; I've often wondered, Why DANZIG? According to
    Wikipedia, the Free City of Danzig was a semi-autonomous city-state
    that existed between 1920 and 1939 (it is now Gdansk, Poland)
    created to give Poland access to a well-sized seaport, though the
    majority-German population deeply resented being separated from
    Germany, and after the war about 300,000 of them either fled to or
    were expelled to East or West Germany.&nbsp; But does any of that
    have to do with TC DANZIG?]<br>

        Interpreter relieves the programmer of dealing with most of this
        complexity within interpreted code. An interpreted program can
        access roughly half of erasable memory and half of fixed memory.</font></p>

          plus the current switched erasable bank (that is, whichever
          bank is currently selected by the AGC's EBANK register). This
          gives an interpreted program access to roughly 1K words, half
          the total amount of erasable memory. Once an interpreted
          program has started, there are no instructions to access the
          AGC's EBANK register, so the code is stuck with whatever
          erasable bank was selected when the Interpreter was called.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><b>Low fixed memory</b> consists of

        The Interpreter prepends this bit onto data addresses if the
        address is 2000 (octal) or above. The net effect is that a
        15-bit address enables any program in low fixed memory to reach

              and are not indexed. The argument is always an address
              (never a value), and can be taken either from the word
              following the instruction, or from the stack. The
              Interpreter determines where to get its argument by
              looking at the word following the instruction. It counts
              on the fact that instruction words always have bit 15 set
              to 1, and arguments that don't involve indexing (and
              instructions in this class never involve indexing) always
              have their bit 15 set to zero. So if the word following
              the instruction has its 15 bit set to 0, it's the argument
              for this instruction; if it's set to 1, it's the next
              instruction and the argument should be pulled off the
              stack.
              [What's not clear to me is how to handle the case in which
              opcode 1 is in class 01, and opcode 2 is in class 11. It
              seems that there could be a problem if the intention is to
              get opcode 1's argument from the stack, but opcode 2's
              argument follows the instruction.]</font></td>

      <b>Notes:</b><br>
      [1] The documentation doesn't specify how the instruction
      determines which index register or step register (1 or 2) is being
      referenced. In the assembly language the programmer has to specify
      a 1 or 2, but does it by placing it immediately after the opcode
      mnemonic ("CLEAR,2"), rather than treating it as an operand
      ("CLEAR 2"). It's possible that there are two distinct numeric
      opcodes for each instruction that references an index register or
      step register.<br>

    <h2><a name="UnprogrammedSequences" id="UnprogrammedSequences"></a>Unprogrammed

      Sequences</h2>
    As mentioned earlier in the <a href="#CPU_Architecture_Registers">CPU

      Architecture</a> section, the AGC provides instruction-like
    entities called "unprogrammed sequences" which are activated
    automatically to modify counter registers upon receiving the proper
    input electrical signals, but which cannot be explicitly used under
    program control.&nbsp; (Hence, the term "unprogrammed".)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In some cases, the action of modifying the counter also
    automatically outputs an electrical signal, independent of the i/o
    channels.&nbsp; Though outputting these signals do not really occur
    as part of what the Apollo docs refer to as unprogrammed sequences,
    I include them here anyway, for reference.<br>
    <br>
    The types and behaviors of these unprogrammed sequences are useful
    to know, even if they cannot explicitly be activated by
    software.&nbsp;<br>
