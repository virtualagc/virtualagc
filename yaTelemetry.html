    <h2><a name="VirtualAGC" id="VirtualAGC"></a>VirtualAGC</h2>
    <h3><a name="The_Basics" id="The_Basics"></a>The Basics<br>
    </h3>
    You may recall seeing an extremely abbreviated description of the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> program <a
      href="index.html#Running_the_Emulator">on the Virtual AGC project
      home page</a>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
        style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        <br>
      </span> VirtualAGC</span> is a GUI front-end which allows you to
    choose almost any reasonable set of options related to the
    emulation, and then to run all of the emulation programs needed, in
    a way that allows those programs to intercommunicate properly.&nbsp;
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> does little for
    you that you couldn't have done from a command line using the
    various programs and their command-line options described on this
    page and on the <a href="yaAGS.html">yaAGS</a>, <a
      href="yaAGC.html">yaAGC</a>, <a href="yaYUL.html">yaYUL</a>, and
    <a href="yaDSKY.html">yaDSKY</a> pages of this website, but it's
    safe to say that it will almost always be easier to accomplish any
    given task using <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    than using equivalent command-line operations.<br>
    <br>
    Depending on the version of the <b>VirtualAGC</b> program, the
    basic <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> screen may
    depend on your display size or on the command-line options you use
    when you invoke the program.&nbsp; In many cases, you'll get a
    screen that looks something like the following.&nbsp; In the upper
    left, where you see "AGC Simulation Type" is a drop-down box where
    you select the Apollo mission and LM vs CM AGC code you want to run
    or to view.<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="Screenshot-VirtualAGC-radio.jpg"
        alt="" width="717" height="657"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Traditionally, a larger, fancier version of the program was used if
    you had a big enough display screen for it (or in latest versions of
    the software, if you ran <b>VirtualAGC</b> with the --radio-buttons
    command-line option), and it's what's shown below.&nbsp; This used
    to be the default (or only!) version of the interface, so it's
    what's used throughout much of this website for illustrative
    purposes.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="border: 2px solid ;"
        alt="Screenshot of VirtualAGC program."
        src="Screenshot-VirtualAGC.jpg" width="1147" height="966"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, if you're really, really strapped for space — say on an
    800×480 Raspberry Pi touchscreen — you can run <b>VirtualAGC</b>
    with the --squish command-line option.&nbsp; This reduces the
    interface to its minimal size and form:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="Screenshot-VirtualAGC-squished.jpg"
        alt="" width="636" height="447"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Regardless of which of the versions you use, however, the main
    screen is the one and only window of the <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">VirtualAGC</span> program.&nbsp; There are no menus,
    toolbars, hot-buttons, or other controls.&nbsp; While a large number
    of options are presented, you don't necessarily need to change any
    of the selected options.&nbsp; The defaults are as shown, and if you
    simply click the "Run!" button at the bottom of the window, the
    simulation will run.&nbsp;<br>
    <h3><a name="Running_the_Simulation_" id="Running_the_Simulation_"></a>Running

      the Simulation<br>
    </h3>
    When you actually do run the simulation by hitting the "Run!"
    button, the large <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    screen shown above politely disappears in order to free up the
    screen space it's using, and instead the a tiny window that looks
    like this replaces it:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="border: 2px solid ;
        width: 395px; height: 192px;" alt="Simulation-running window."
        src="Screenshot-VirtualAGC-running.jpg" width="395" height="192"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    This window is gimicked to stay atop all of the other windows open
    on the screen, but you can minimize it to make it disappear if you
    don't like seeing it.&nbsp; Note, however, that while the simulation
    is running you won't be able use <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>'s

    controls to open a new browser window for viewing the source code,
    so if you want to do that you'll need to do it before hitting
    "Run!".&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    To end the simulation, simply exit from any of the visible elements
    of the simulation, such as the simulated DSKY.&nbsp; Within a few
    seconds all of the other elements of the simulation will
    automatically terminate and the large <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">VirtualAGC</span> window will return.&nbsp; On some
    platforms, there may be curious exceptions to this behavior that
    result in some windows needing to be explicitly manually closed, but
    closing the DSKY is a good recommendation for all platforms.&nbsp;
    The small simulation screen depicted in the screenshot above cannot
    itself be closed manually, so do not expect that the simulation can
    be ended by closing this screen.<br>
    <br>
    We'll discuss the <a href="#How_to_Create_Equivalent_Command-Line">"More",

      "Less"</a>, and <a href="#Digital_Uplinks">"Uplink"</a> buttons
    later.&nbsp; You don't need to know about them for basic operation.<br>
    <h3><a name="All_About_Settings" id="All_About_Settings"></a>All
      About Settings<br>
    </h3>
    If you change any of the settings on the <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">VirtualAGC</span> screen, the program will remember those
    changes and the settings you've selected will be the ones that
    appear the next time you run <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;


    On the other hand, you could click the "Defaults" button at the
    bottom of the window to restore all of the settings to their
    defaults.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    There is, however, a subtle distinction between closing the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> main window using the
    "Exit" button at the bottom of the window, and using the
    operating-system-supplied controls on the border of the
    window.&nbsp; The settings are saved only when the "Exit" button is
    used.&nbsp; They'll not be saved if the window's border controls are
    used instead.<br>
    <br>
    All of the settings are intelligent, in the sense that not all
    settings are reasonable in combination with other settings, and so
    illegal settings are grayed out and disabled.&nbsp; As you change
    some settings, it may cause other settings to become enabled or
    disabled.&nbsp; So it's hard to choose a combination of settings
    that don't work reasonably well together.<br>
    <h4><a name="The_Simulation_Type_settings_"
        id="The_Simulation_Type_settings_"></a>The Simulation Type
      settings</h4>
    The left-hand pane of the screen is used to select the specific
    software to be run on the simulated AGC.&nbsp; Included are all of
    the versions of the <a href="Colossus.html">Colossus</a> and <a
      href="Luminary.html">Luminary</a> AGC programs that have been made
    available to the Virtual AGC project.&nbsp; The grayed-out
    mission/spacecraft combinations in this area are the ones for which
    the original software isn't yet available, but in many cases is
    known to exist in museums or private collections.&nbsp; But we
    maintain hope that they'll eventually be made available to the
    admiring public, so we put them on the list anyway!&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The "Validation Suite" choice was not, of course, used in any actual
    Apollo mission.&nbsp; However, at one time there was a software
    validation suite that checked out the AGC CPU registers and
    instructions for proper behavior.&nbsp; (I surmise that this code
    was originally intended to be included in the flight software as
    part of the built-in self-test, but was mostly removed due to memory
    constraints.)&nbsp; While that software no longer exists, as far as
    I know, <a href="hrst/archive/1705.pdf">the program documentation
      for it does exist</a>, and the Validation Suite program was
    created by closely following the documentation of the original
    validation suite.&nbsp; And a good thing, too, since in doing so a
    number of implementation errors were uncovered that might have
    lingered to cause mysterious problems later!&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    You'll also notice a box for selecting "custom" software.&nbsp; This
    would be software you had written yourself, or perhaps acquired from
    enthusiasts.&nbsp; Normally all of the selections in the Simulation
    Type pane are expected to be executable binary code which has been
    pre-assembled from source code, so if you have your own AGC source
    code you'll want to read below about <a
      href="#Assembling_AGC_or_AEA_Source_Code">how to assemble</a> it.<br>
    <h4><a name="The_Interfaces_settings" id="The_Interfaces_settings"></a>The

      Interfaces settings</h4>
    The middle pane of the screen is mostly devoted to selecting the
    particular set of peripheral devices—in most cases, interfaces to
    the simulated CPUs—which you wish to simulate.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Here's a brief description of all of the devices appearing in the
    interface pane:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Guidance Computer" is, of course, the simulated AGC CPU
        which is described so thoroughly on <a href="yaAGC.html">the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> program</a>
        page.&nbsp; We assume that you'll always want to include this in
        the simulation, so we don't actually allow you to deselect it.</li>
      <li>And the "DSKY", of course, is the simulated display/keypad
        unit which is the principal user interface to the AGC, described
        on <a href="yaDSKY.html">the yaDSKY or yaDSKY2 program</a>
        page.&nbsp; As with the AGC simulation, we assume you'll always
        want a DSKY and therefore it is always selected.</li>
      <li>The "Attitude Controller Assembly" (ACA) is a joystick
        interface simulating the LM pilot's (or more accurately, the
        mission commander's) control stick in the LM.&nbsp; Since it is
        used only for the LM, it is not selectable in a CM
        simulation.&nbsp; The functionality is described in more detail
        below in the section covering <a href="#yaACA">the yaACA
          program</a>.</li>
      <li>The "Telemetry Downlink Monitor" is an interface that lets you
        see the telemetry information continually being transmitted from
        the AGC to mission control.&nbsp; The functionality is described
        below in more detail, in the section covering <a
          href="#yaTelemetry">the yaTelemetry program</a>.</li>
      <li>The "LM Abort Computer" (sometimes known as the AEA or AGS) is
        computer used in the LM, but of a different design and software
        than the AGC, which served to back up the AGC but only during
        landing aborts.&nbsp; Since it appears only in the LM, it is not
        selectable for CM simulations.&nbsp; This is described in much
        more detail on <a href="yaAGS.html">the yaAGS program</a> page.</li>
      <li>The "DEDA" is the display/keypad unit providing the principal
        user interface to the LM abort computer, and is therefore
        selectable only when "LM Abort Computer" is also selected.&nbsp;
        In fact, we assume that if you have the abort computer, you will
        definitely want the DEDA, so we don't allow you to deselect
        it.&nbsp; It's described in more detail as <a
          href="yaAGS.html#yaDEDA_the_AGS_User-Interface">the yaDEDA or
          yaDEDA2 program</a>.</li>
      <li>The "AGC CPU Bus/Input/Output Monitor" is an interface which
        continually displays information about various i/o channels of
        the AGC CPU and allows you to log the data. (Note that the
        Monitor interface has a quirk which may be slightly confusing,
        in that it waits about 30 seconds after the remainder of the
        simulation starts up before it and its associated interfaces
        listed below start up.)&nbsp; The Monitor is useful for either
        CM or LM simulations.&nbsp; However, its main importance is that
        it is the main window of <a
          href="#LM_Simulator_by_Stephan_Hotto">Stephan Hotto's <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> program</a>.&nbsp;

        The other elements of <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
        are presently of very limited usefulness for CM simulations, and
        so aren't selectable except for LM simulations, nor are they
        selectable if "AGC CPU Bus/Input/Output Monitor" isn't
        selected.&nbsp; However, any of them can be started from the
        menu system in <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
        at runtime, so selecting or deselecting these elements merely
        affects whether or not they are started <span
          style="font-style: italic;">automatically</span> when the
        simulation begins.&nbsp; Those other elements comprise the
        remaining selections in the Interfaces pane:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The "Intertial Measurement Unit" (IMU) provides two
          important things:&nbsp; the IMU itself, which contintually
          tracks the rotation and acceleration of the spacecraft, and
          the FDAI (8-ball), which is a graphical representation for the
          pilot of the spacecraft orientation.</li>
        <li>The "Discrete Outputs" interface continuously displays the
          states of various output channels of the AGC.</li>
        <li>The "Discrete Inputs (crew)" interface allows setting
          various signals read by the AGC on its input channels that
          would normally controlled by the crew by means of switches on
          the LM control panel.&nbsp; There is no attempt to visually
          mimic the appearance of the switches or the control panel.</li>
        <li>The "Discrete Inputs (system)" interface allows setting
          various signals read by the AGC on its input channels that
          would normally be supplied by the spacecraft itself rather
          than being directly controlled by the crew.</li>
        <li>The "Propulsion/Fuel/Thrust Monitor" interface provides a
          continuous display of the current fuel supply and thruster
          statuses.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    You'll also notice a couple of buttons in the Interfaces pane.&nbsp;
    The "Novice" button is a short-cut that simply deselects everything
    except the minimal set of devices, namely the AGC and DSKY
    simulations.&nbsp; Conversely, the "Expert" button is a short-cut
    that selects every device that's reasonable with the spacecraft and
    mission type you've selected in the "Simulation Type" pane.<br>
    <h4><a name="The_LM_Abort_Computer_AEA_settings"
        id="The_LM_Abort_Computer_AEA_settings"></a>The LM Abort
      Computer (AEA) settings</h4>
    Here you can select the specific software set which will be run on
    the Abort Guidance System (AGS or AEA) simulated CPU.&nbsp; It would
    have been more logical to include this in the "Simulation Type"
    area, but alas! there's only so much space available.&nbsp; In the
    screen-shot above, this area is completely grayed-out because the
    "LM Abort computer (AEA)" box is not checked in the "Devices" area,
    so the AGS/AEA simulation would not actually be run.&nbsp; If it
    were enabled, however, <a href="yaAGS.html#AGS_Flight_Software">any
      AEA flight program to which the Virtual AGC project has been given
      access</a> could be selected.&nbsp; Other versions of the AEA
    flight software which are believed to have existed (and hoped to
    still exist) appear also on the selection list, but are disabled and
    grayed out until the happy time when the Virtual AGC project
    acquires access to them.<br>
    <br>
    As with the AGC software selection, it's possible to select custom
    software in place of actual mission software if you wished to write
    your own AEA software.&nbsp; As with the custom AGC software, it is
    expected that the software you select is a pre-assembled executable
    binary.&nbsp; But also see below about <a
      href="#Assembling_AGC_or_AEA_Source_Code">assembling AEA source
      code</a>.<br>
    <h4><a name="The_Options_settings" id="The_Options_settings"></a>The
      Options settings</h4>
    The right-hand area of the screen allows you to set various minor
    options associated with the exact manner in which the various
    emulated devices are run.&nbsp; I won't bother to explain most of
    these in great detail since they're pretty self-explanatory, but
    here are a few words of explanation anyway:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>AGC "Restart program, wiping memory."&nbsp; This option
        provides a completely clean boot.&nbsp; You should note that
        this would not have been the normal behavior of a real AGC,
        since the ferrite core memory of the AGC would have retained its
        state in spite of power-cycling.&nbsp; However, it is the
        appropriate default for a non-experienced user.</li>
      <li>AGC "Restart program, preserving memory."&nbsp; This option
        preserves the contents of volatile memory, but not of the CPU
        program counter, interrupt state, and other CPU central
        registers, so the program starts from its entry vector even
        though the values of all variables are preserved from the prior
        run(s).</li>
      <li>AGC "Resume from ending point of prior run."&nbsp; This option
        preserves not only the contents of volatile memory, but also the
        CPU state, so that execution picks up from some point in the
        midst of the program rather than from the entry vector.&nbsp; It
        should be noted that neither this option nor the preceding
        option can really do exactly what they claim, since the contents
        of memory are not written to the Linux/Windows/Mac filesystem on
        a machine-cycle to machine-cycle basis.&nbsp; Rather, the memory
        is snapshotted at regular intervals (nominally 10 seconds), and
        therefore the state of the machine is only accurate to the point
        of the last snapshot.</li>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">It's important to note that
            halting the simulation and then resuming it later is not
            like the pause feature in a video game, because Virtual AGC
            is not a computer game.&nbsp; The ability to resume program
            execution is not something that has been layered atop the
            simulation ... rather, it is simply a characteristic of the
            computer memories used at that time: the AGC retained the
            contents of memory across power cycles, and therefore
            Virtual AGC does as well.<br>
            <br>
            If your only interest is in the guidance computer itself,
            then this distinction is unimportant.&nbsp; However, if you
            are interested in the system as a whole, then the
            distinction is important because it means that only the
            state of the AGC is preserved, and <span style="font-style:
              italic;">not</span> the state of the entire
            simulation.&nbsp; In particular, the states of the <a
              href="#LM_Simulator_by_Stephan_Hotto">IMU, FDAI,
              propulsion system, discrete inputs, etc., from the
              LM-Simulator program</a> are not preserved.&nbsp; For
            example, if you stopped the simulation in the middle of a
            descent to the lunar surface, when you resumed it later the
            AGC would think it was still in the middle of the landing,
            but the orientation of the spacecraft would have changed,
            the fuel tanks suddenly would be full, etc.<br>

      <li>AGC "Custom" program resumption is a more flexible form of
        "Resume from ending point of prior run".&nbsp; Because of the

        provided by <a href="#LM_Simulator_by_Stephan_Hotto">Stephan
          Hotto's LM-Simulator program</a>.&nbsp; The rationale for this
        is that <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
        was at one time portable to a greater range of platforms than <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, however this is
        probably no longer true, and it is likely that you will have
        equal or greater luck running <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
        on most platforms.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the option remains
        available and may be useful in some cases.</li>

      <li>"Retro" Downlink.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with
        retro-rockets.&nbsp; It is an alternate way of displaying the
        Telemetry Downlink Monitor, which somewhat resembles a CRT
        display, and (to my eyes) has an amusingly pleasing retro
        appearance.&nbsp; However, it is very wasteful of screen space,
        without being resizable, and therefore is really only usable on
        large display screens.&nbsp; The two telemetry styles are
        compared side by side below.&nbsp; These half-size screenshots
        aren't completely legible, but the difference in screen
        real-estate and style is apparent; I might add that the
        resizable style (if the screenshot had not been reduced by 50%)
        would have been legible at an even smaller font size, and the
        difference in screen real-estate would have been even more
        dramatic.<br>

    A fun thing to do (in an über-geekish way) is to write <span

    I have written the Validation Suite.&nbsp; So naturally, one of the
    options mentoned above is to run your own custom
    software.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you simply type a filename into the box
    which is supposed to contain the filename of your custom software,
    it's expected to be a binary file which has already been run through
    the assembler.&nbsp; However, if instead of typing in a filename you
    use the <img alt="&quot;...&quot; button" src="BrowseButton.jpg"
      style="width: 39px; height: 31px;" width="39" height="31"

    that it displays the contents of a shell script (or a Windows batch
    file) that could be used to run the simulation from a command-line
    (or by other means) without needing to invoke <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp;<br>

    <br>
    This information would also be useful to you if you wanted to create
    a custom setup too complex for <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    to handle, such as running a Command Module simulation that had two
    DSKYs, or if you wanted to run the simulation on several PCs ganged
    together via a network. The displayed commands can be cut-and-pasted
    into a text editor for subsequent modification.&nbsp; Clicking the
    "Less" button causes this extra display to disappear again from
    view.<br>
    <br>
    Not only that, but running the simulation from the command line
    using scripts can be very helpful if troubleshooting needs to be
    performed.&nbsp; In normal operation, <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">VirtualAGC</span> tries to hide as much complexity from you
    as possible, and one thing which it hides from you is the messages
    printed out by the various programs in the Virtual AGC suite.&nbsp;
    These messages include such helpful information as socket connects
    and disconnects (as the various peripheral devices try to
    communicate with the simulated CPUs), and the joystick positions
    being reported by the ACA simulation to the AGC.&nbsp; The latter
    are helpful to know because there are some joystick-related
    configuration differences from platform to platform and joystick to
    joystick.&nbsp; When running the simulation directly from the
    command line via a script, all of these messages become visible.<br>
    <br>
    You could, of course, reconstruct all this information yourself by
    examining the documentation of the various component programs, but
    it's much simpler to adapt an existing script rather than to create
    one from scratch.<br>

        id="Getting_the_Simulation_to_a_Known_State"></a>Getting the
      Simulation to a Known State<br>
    </h3>
    One thing that quickly becomes apparent in running the AGC
    simulation is that setting up the AGC to a given state can be very
    time-consuming, so it is helpful to have a method of automating that
    process.&nbsp;&nbsp; VirtualAGC actually provides two separate
    methods of setting up the simulated AGC to a known state:&nbsp;
    Digital Uplinks and resumption from core-dumps.&nbsp; Each of these
    methods has advantages and disadvantages relative to the other, so
    it is not possible to provide a blanket recommendation for just one
    of them.&nbsp; There may even be cases where a combination of the
    methods is the best approach.&nbsp; In general, the disadvantages of
    the Digital Uplink are that it is slower to use and more cumbersome
    to set up than core dumps.&nbsp; The disadvantages of the core dump
    are that although the CPU state is restored, the states of
    peripheral devices are less likely to be in sync and that it is
    impossible to combine core dumps (whereas it is possible to combine
    different digital uplinks) containing initialization of different
    subsystems.&nbsp;<br>
    <h4><a name="Digital_Uplinks" id="Digital_Uplinks"></a>Digital
      Uplinks</h4>
    Digital Uplink was a method that could be used by mission control to
    transmit data to the AGC, and is the complement of the "digital
    downlink" for transmitting data from the AGC to mission control
    discussed in <a href="#yaTelemetry">the yaTelemetry section</a>
    below.<br>
    <br>
    What the digital uplink implemented was essentially a stream of DSKY
    keycodes.&nbsp; Thus, any condition in the AGC which could be set up
    via the DSKY could also be set up via digital uplink.&nbsp; I'm not
    sure exactly how this was done in the original missions—a DSKY in
    the control room? a paper tape?—but in <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">VirtualAGC</span> it is accomplished by creating a file
    containing a script of DSKY keycodes.&nbsp; The digital uplink is
    the single piece of functionality provided by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> itself rather than by
    other yaPrograms, so if you need a digital uplink there's presently
    no way to provide it without interactively running <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.<br>
    <br>
    To send a digital uplink, you click the "Uplink" button in <a
      href="#Running_the_Simulation_">the simulation window</a>, and
    then select the DSKY-keycode script you'd like to use from the
    file-selection dialog which pops up.&nbsp; Once you've done so, the
    "Uplink" button changes to a "Cancel" button, and the simulation
    window acquires a new pane which shows the status of the uplink in
    progress:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="border: 1px solid ;
        width: 490px; height: 694px;" alt="Screenshot of digital-uplink
        status screen." src="Screenshot-VirtualAGC-uplink.jpg"
        width="490" height="694"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Eventually, this method may be used for uplinks to the AEA as well
    as to the LM or CM AGC, but at present I don't know enough about the
    uplink system for the AEA to implement it.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Here are the rulea for creating DSKY-keycode scripts for digital
    uplinks to LM or CM AGC simulations:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The type of simulation for which the uplink script is targeted
        is determined by the first character in the file, namely:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>'C' for a CM uplink.</li>
        <li>'L' for an LM uplink.</li>
        <li>'A' for an AEA uplink.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Comments beginning with '#' are ignored.&nbsp; In other words,
        everything between a '#" character and the end of the line is
        ignored.</li>
      <li>Text strings between an '!' character and the end of line have
        a special purpose <a
          href="#Scripted_operation_for_tutorials_museum">that is
          described later</a>, but don't affect the uplink or the
        simulation in any way.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The following characters are translated directly into DSKY
        keycodes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>'0'—the 0-key</li>
        <li>'1'—the 1-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'2'—the 2-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'3'—the 3-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'4'—the 4-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'5'—the 5-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'6'—the 6-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'7'—the 7-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'8'—the 8-key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'+'—the + key<br>
        </li>
        <li>'-'—the - key</li>
        <li>'V'—the VERB key</li>
        <li>'N'—the NOUN key</li>
        <li>'E'—the ENTR key</li>
        <li>'C'—the CLR key</li>
        <li>'R'—the RST key</li>
        <li>'K'—the KEY-REL key</li>
        <li>Note that the DSKY does not report the PRO key to the AGC by
          means of a keycode, so the PRO can cannot be transmitted via
          digital uplink.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Since the AGC responds to digital-uplinks just as it responds
        to the DSKY, you can't assume that it responds instantly to all
        uplinked commands.&nbsp; In other words, some delays may be
        necessary to give the AGC time to process the commands it
        receives.&nbsp; I'm not certain how this was handled in the real
        hardware, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
        provides a two-step method for adding delays to uplink data:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A delay of 0.2 seconds is automatically inserted by <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> between the
          transmission of any two keycodes.</li>
        <li>Any place the space character (' ') appears in the script,
          an extra delay of 0.5 seconds is inserted.&nbsp; (This applies
          only to literal spaces, and not to other whitspace such as
          tabs or newlines.)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If the character 'Z' is placed in the script, it causes a
        special code to be transmitted which clears uplink errors.&nbsp;
        However, since it is impossible for the simulated uplink to be
        corrupted as a real transmission might be, the 'Z' character
        should probably never be used.</li>
      <li>All other characters are transparently discarded.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    If you try to relate this information to the screenshot above,
    showing an actual uplink in progress, it's pretty straightforward to
    do so.&nbsp; The only point worth mentioning is that the dots
    appearing in the screenshot are where additional 0.5 second delays
    appeared in the script.<br>
    <br>
    There are, however, a few subtleties which the rules above impose on
    the scripts which may not be obvious, so let's illustrate this with
    a real script:<br>

    The first subtlety is that since the space character is used to
    insert extra transmission delays, while the tab character is not,
    and yet tabs and spaces are visually indistinguishable, it's not
    immediately obvious in looking at the script where the extra delays
    have been inserted.&nbsp; I've handled it in this script by
    enclosing the spaces in quotes.&nbsp; The quote character is simply
    discarded when the script is parsed, and so its presence causes no
    harm.&nbsp; There are many other methods which could be used, of
    course.<br>
    <br>
    The second subtlety is that if you like to format the script nicely,
    by doing things like aligning the comments, you'd better do so using
    tab characters only or else you'll have lots of unwanted delays
    added to the transmission.<br>
    <br>
    The extra delay at the very end of the script has no functional
    significance, but allows the status display to remain on the screen
    5 seconds after transmission of the "V16N36E" command, rather than
    disappearing instantly on transmission of that command.&nbsp; I did
    this merely to make the status message readable.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; The AGC is not
    able to properly accept digital uplinks at arbitrary times, and must
    be prepared in advance to do so.&nbsp; I'm not sure at this writing
    exactly what preparation is required, but (at least after a clean
    power-up) a DSKY-test a "goto pooh" command (V37E00E) entered
    directly from the DSKY keypad seems to do the trick.&nbsp; After the
    DSKY test completes, a digital uplink is accepted.<br>
    <h4><a name="Core_Dumps" id="Core_Dumps"></a>Core Dumps</h4>
    An alternative to Digital Uplinks in getting the simulated AGC CPU
    to a known state is to use the method of "core dumps" instead.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="#The_Options_settings">As mentioned above</a>, when the
    simulated CM or LM AGC is running, it saves a snapshot of its
    simulated ferrite-core memory periodically.&nbsp; Nominally, these
    "core dump" files are saved at 10-second intervals.&nbsp; The
    core-dump files are named "CM.core" or "LM.core", depending on
    whether it is a CM or an LM simulation being run.&nbsp; One of the
    items under the Options Settings, "Resume from ending point of prior
    run", allows you to start the next simulation run with the memory
    contents and CPU state of the last relevant core-dump file.&nbsp;
    (In other words, a CM simulation can be started from the last
    CM.core, and an LM simulation from the last LM.core.)&nbsp; Thus, to
    get the AGC into a desired state you could use the DSKY to set it
    up, and then resume the simulation later with those settings.<br>
    <br>
    The difficulty, of course, is that after you had resumed the
    simulation, execution of the simulation might result in an
    alteration of your setups, so if you resumed the simulation still
    later you would no longer have the same setups.<br>
    <br>
    This is handled by an additional item ("Custom") in the AGC Startup
    area in <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>'s Option
    Settings pane.&nbsp; What this item does is to let you save <span
      style="font-style: italic;">named</span> copies of your LM.core or
    CM.core files (using the "Save" button), and then to later resume
    execution of the AGC simulation from your named core-dump files
    rather than from the generic LM.core or CM.core files.&nbsp; The
    core-dumps made after resumption of the simulation are still called
    LM.core or CM.core, so your named core-dump file is not affected by
    the continuing simulation and could still be used later to exactly
    duplicate your setups.<br>
    <br>
    You can make as many saved core-dump files as you like, and the area
    under Options Settings allows you to either type in the name of the
    file directly, or else to browse for it using the "..." button.<br>
    <br>
    It is perhaps worth noting also that while LM.core and CM.core are
    created automatically at 10-second intervals, if you are running AGC
    under its debug monitor then you can use debug-monitor commands to
    manually save core-dump files (with names of your own choosing) that
    are accurate to the machine-cycle at which they are saved.&nbsp; By
    default, <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> likes
    to save and look for core-dump files in the scenarios/ folder, so if
    you save core-dump files from the debugger it is best to prefix the
    names with "scenario/".<br>

        id="Scripted_operation_for_tutorials_museum"></a>Scripted
      operation for tutorials, museum exhibits, and other demo purposes</h3>
    (For related functionality that can be used interactively rather for
    unattended operation, see the <a href="yaDSKY.html#SpecialEffects">yaDSKY

      page</a>.)<br>
    <br>
    The <a href="#Digital_Uplinks">Digital Uplink capability described
      above</a> has a special feature that could be used in a variety of
    instructional settings, of which a few are listed in the title of
    this section.&nbsp; Specifically, it is possible to embed commands
    in the digital upload script which cause programs of your choice to
    be run when those positions in the script are reached.&nbsp;
    Specifically, when the uplink script finds an '!' character, any
    text between the '!' and the end of line is treated as a command
    which would be suitably run from your operating system's
    command-line.<br>
    <br>
    Interesting software which might be run in this fashion includes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio-playback commands.</li>
      <li>Commands which pop up a window containing descriptive text.</li>
      <li>Commands which provide remote control of lighting or
        industrial automation.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    For example, you could imagine creating a tutorial on some
    particular sequence of operations on the DSKY, where at each
    critical point a window opened up to describe the operation that was
    being performed.&nbsp; Or you could imagine a museum display with a
    simulated DSKY on an LCD screen, and an audio commentary
    synchronized to the operations being performed on the DSKY.<br>
    <br>
    Here is the example digital uplink script used earlier, but with
    embedded commands for audio playback using the <span

    used to pause the uplink or branch to alternate possible uplinks,
    but if anyone has a serious use for this kind of capability, I'm
    sure it could be added.<br>

    This is a kind of proof-of-concept program, which is in the process
    of becoming an IMU simulation.&nbsp; It's pretty close to being
    complete. &nbsp; But the program is useful even without a complete
    IMU simulation, as a nifty little monitor for the CPU's i/o
    channels.&nbsp; You can use it to see the output on output channels,
    to generate input on input channels, or else to simply monitor or
    generate arbitrary messages on the socket interface.&nbsp; At the
    moment, it's specifically targeted towards the Lunar Module
    simulation, but because there is a very great overlap between the
    way peripherals like the IMU were implemented in the LM and CM, you
    can profitably use <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
    with the Command Module simulation as well.&nbsp; Nevertheless, be
    aware that not everything you see in the CM version of the program
    is actually present in the CM!&nbsp; Also, at present the program
    interacts only with the AGC simulation (<span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaAGC</span>).<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> is provided in
    the Virtual AGC developer snapshot and all of the binary packages,
    and is completely integrated into the <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI.&nbsp; So you don't have to do
    anything special to get it or to run it.&nbsp; The program is
    written in the Tcl/Tk script language, however, so you do have to
    have Tcl/Tk installed.&nbsp; Like most of the rest of Virtual AGC, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> is licensed under
    the GPL.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Here are some notes from Stephan on its use, as edited somewhat
    freely by me.&nbsp; The program is a moving target, and I'm
    combining text from a number of different emails here, so you can
    blame me for any incoherence.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> As a by-product [of the IMU
      development] I've created a small Tcl/Tk program to monitor the
      activity of the output channels and to manipulate dedicated bits
      of the input channels, which is probably&nbsp; useful in
      developing the different interfaces.&nbsp; Because it is written
      in an interpreter language you can use it on Linux/Windows/MAC
      without any change. The only pre-condition is an installed Tcl/Tk
      environment. For example under LINUX you can simply type "wish
      lm_simulator.tcl".&nbsp;&nbsp; [The <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI can automatically start <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>, so you really
      don't need to start it explicitly, but you can also explicitly
      start it as described.]<br>
      <br>
      The monitor connects to the localhost on port 19801 (IMU reserved
      port) [or port 19701 for the CM] and is focused on the Luminary
      131(1C) channel allocation.&nbsp; If you, for example, want to
      simulate a "Temperature of Stable Member out of Design Limits"
      then you can set the input channel 30 to "100000000000000" and the
      DSKY Temperature warning will go on.&nbsp; [After he wrote this,
      Stephan implemented a checkbox for this particular input, so it's
      actually much easier than he says, but what he says here still
      works.]<br>
      <br>

    The program has a configuration file called "lm_simulator.ini" which
    can be used to configure some aspects of <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">LM-Simulator</span>'s operation.&nbsp; The program has
    built-in configuration options, but these can be overridden with the
    configuration file, which in turn can be overridden by command-line
    options.&nbsp; I won't bother to describe this configuration file in
    detail, since you'll see how it works if you look at it.&nbsp;
    Basically, it tells you which port to use to connect to <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, and determines which of <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>'s windows to
    automatically open at startup.<br>
    <br>
    As of 2005-06-19, the usage of <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
    is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">cd <span style="font-style: italic;">InstallationDirectory</span></span><br

      <span style="font-family: monospace;">lm_simulator [OPTIONS]</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The currently-recognized command-line options are:<br>
    <br>
    --port=<span style="font-style: italic;">PortNum</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Changes the port number (by
      default, 19801) used to connect to <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp; This can also be changed in the
      configuration file.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --cfg=<span style="font-style: italic;">IniFilename</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Used to change the name of the
      configuration-file used.&nbsp; By default, the file is
      lm_simulator.ini, in the installation directory.&nbsp; With this
      option, you can change the name or directory of the file.<br>

    If you discover problems with <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>,

    </h2>
    John Pultorak, of <a href="Pultorak.html">Block 1 AGC
      hardware-simulator</a> fame, has provided a <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Game Pack</span> containing a 1- or

    source tree under Contributed/GamePack/.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it
    does not yet run on <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    for a couple of reasons.&nbsp; If anybody cares to fix it up, I'd be
    ever so grateful.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>It is written in the syntax of John's assembler rather than <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>, so it cannot be
        assembled; and</li>
      <li>It depends on the presence of <span style="font-weight:

        but there is no room left in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
        in which to fit it.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    The reason it depends on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
    is for such stuff as accessing the DSKY, which it could do by
    directly accessing the DSKY through i/o channels.<br>

    <h2><a name="yaUniverse" id="yaUniverse"></a>yaUniverse</h2>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span> is a program that
    physically models the motion of the spacecraft and of the heavenly
    bodies visible to the spacecraft or affecting it.&nbsp; From knowing
    the initial time, position, and velocity of the spacecraft, and
    application of physical laws, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span>
    is able to calculate the position and orientation of the spacecraft
    and heavenly bodies at all times relevant to the mission.&nbsp; At
    present, the program exists and accounts for gravitational
    influences, but is not integrated with other Virtual AGC software
    such as the (currently non-existent) <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaIMU</span> program that would be the principal consumer
    of the data.<br>
    <br>
    Eventually, all of the forces acting on the spacecraft might be
    accounted for, such as:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>(Required)&nbsp; Gravitation from the Earth, Moon, Sun, etc.</li>
      <li>(Required)&nbsp; Thrust applied by the spacecraft
        itself.&nbsp; (It should be noted that thrust expends fuel, and
        thus reduces the mass and the changes the inertia tensor—i.e.,
        the rotational characteristics—of the spacecraft.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>(Optional)&nbsp; Atmospheric drag for launch or reentry.</li>
      <li>... and any other forces we might like to imagine (such as
        outgassing from an exploding Apollo 13 oxygen tank).</li>
    </ul>
    Originally I intended not to calculate the positions of heavenly
    bodies in real time, but rather to use pre-calculated or
    pre-tabulated ephemeris data.&nbsp; However, the amount of ephemeris
    data is pretty large, so I've instead decided to use the laws of
    physics to track the heavenly bodies as well as the
    spacecraft.&nbsp; Note that the <span style="font-style: italic;">initial</span>
    positions and velocities of the heavenly bodies still need to be
    obtained somehow, but they can simply be gotten for any given
    mission epoch by downloading them from the Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory's HORIZONS system at<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre>telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775</pre>
    </div>
    I'll do all of the downloading, of course, though at present
    (2004-09-23) I include only Apollo 8 data in the development
    snapshot.<br>
    <br>
    An additional complication is that even though I've spoken above of
    "the spacecraft", there is not just a single spacecraft.&nbsp;
    Rather, there several spacecraft, which at any given time in the
    mission may be docked or separated:&nbsp; the CM, the SM, the LM's
    descent stage, the LM's ascent stage, the Saturn stages, and various
    combined versions of these.&nbsp; The motion of each must be
    tracked.&nbsp; For example, it may be necessary in the course of the
    mission for the the astronaut to use the CSM's AOT (see below) to
    mark the position of the LM.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaUniverse</span> provides the data for this to <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAOT</span>, and thus must be able to
    simultaneously track the CSM and the LM.<br>
    <br>
    Like <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span> would be a server
    from which <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaIMU</span> and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAOT</span> obtain data.&nbsp; A TCP
    socket interface is used for this, though the data protocol is
    presently TBD.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span> requires no user
    interface, other than a way to define the starting time, positions,
    velocities, and physical characteristics of the spacecraft.&nbsp;
    However, it would be convenient to have at least some kind of
    running printout of positions, velocities, orientations, and masses.<br>
    <br>
    The barest beginning of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span>
    exists.&nbsp; It is presently capable only of numerically
    integrating the positions of the heavenly bodies and spacecraft, but
    not of communicating this information to <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaAGC</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The syntax is:<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Selects the name of the mission,
      which determines the initial positions of the Earth, Moon, Sun,
      Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn for the mission, and thus the
      gravitational influences on the spacecraft.&nbsp; The mission
      names, by convention, are "Apollo8" (without quotes), "Apollo9",
      etc.&nbsp; The default is "Apollo8".&nbsp; The actual ephemeris
      files used have names like "Ephemeris-Earth-Apollo8.txt",
      "Ephemeris-Moon-Apollo8.txt", and "Ephemeris-Sun-Apollo8.txt", but
      this is transparent to the user.&nbsp; The Apollo8 mission is
      special, in that it contains complete ephemeris data (rather than
      mere initial conditions) and hence can be used for testing <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span>'s ability to
      perform numerical integrations of planetary positions.<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Causes <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaUniverse</span> to print a report testing its numerical
      integration algorithms and then quit.&nbsp; It forces
      --mission=Apollo8.&nbsp; Specifically, what it does is this:&nbsp;
      From the initial positions and velocities of the supported
      heavenly bodies (Earth, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, etc.), it computes
      locations of all heavenly bodies for the complete Apollo 8 mission
      epoch.&nbsp; It then compares these with the pre-tabulated
      ephemeris.&nbsp; Only the error in the Earth/Moon positions is
      really interesting, since that's the region of space in which the
      Apollo spacecraft operated. At present, with the default settints,
      the cumulative error in Earth/Moon positions at the end of the
      9-day epoch is about 0.35 km (which I consider acceptable, but
      which I'd like to improve in the future).<br>

      If the Galileans are added, you will need to adjust the timestep

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAOT</span> would be a simulation
    of the Alignment Optical Telescope (AOT).&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAOT</span> would be a client of both
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span> servers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    From the orientation of the spacecraft (obtained from <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaUniverse</span>), and from the
    orientation of the telescope with respect to the spacecraft (which
    is initially driven by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>),

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAOT</span> would be able to
    compute the direction which the telescope is pointing.&nbsp; From
    starcharts, it would be able to display a star-field on the
    PC.&nbsp; The astronaut could then manually adjusts the orientation
    of the telescope (i.e, the star-field) to point at the objects he is
    attempting to mark; these objects could be stars, reference points
    such as the Earth horizon, or the other spacecraft—i.e., the LM or
    CM.&nbsp; The new orientation of the telescope could then read back
    by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.<br>
    <br>
    No work on this program has yet been done, other than researching
    available star data.&nbsp; Star-data is available online and, as

    The Attitude Controller Assembly (ACA)—also known as the rotational
    hand-controller (RHC)—is used by astronaut to affect the pitch,
    roll, and yaw of the LM.&nbsp; José Portillo has described the
    interaction between the ACA and AGC in great detail in a paper (<a
      href="http://www.klabs.org/mapld04/papers/g/g202_portillo_p.pdf">klabs.org/mapld04/papers/g/g202_portillo_p.pdf</a>)
    which is the basis of all ACA-related work in Virtual AGC.&nbsp;
    Refer to the <a href="developer.html#Fictitious_IO_Channels">developer

      page</a> and to the <a
      href="assembly_language_manual.html#CPU_Architecture_Registers">assembly-language


      manual</a> if you're interested in knowing more about the
    integration between the ACA simulation and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp; Note that <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> retransmits any
    input-channel data received from the ACA simulation, so other
    onboard devices (such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>)
    wishing to receive RHC data automatically receive this data even
    though not connected to the ACA simulation.<br>
    <br>
    In Virtual AGC, the ACA is simulated by one of three essentially
    equivalent programs called (surprise!) <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaACA</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>,
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>.&nbsp; Since you
    are unlikely have an <span style="font-style: italic;">actual</span>
    ACA unless you're very, very lucky indeed, the simulated ACA instead
    uses a 3D joystick like that used for many computer games.&nbsp; The
    ACA simulation interacts with the joystick and sends the simulated
    AGC CPU information related to the displacement of the joystick from
    its neutral position.<br>
    <br>
    Why three separate programs?&nbsp; Well, it has turned out to be
    much more difficult (for me, anyway!) to write a joystick program
    that I can be confident works on all supported platforms than it has
    been to make sure that the remainder of Virtual AGC is portable
    across platforms.&nbsp; Therefore, as time went on, I found the need
    to experiment and to create several such programs.&nbsp;
    Technically, the three programs differ in using different underlying
    libraries (not written by me) to access the joystick, but what's
    important to you as a user is that if one of the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA<span style="font-style: italic;">x</span></span>
    programs doesn't work for your operating system or joystick, another
    might.&nbsp; So I pass all of them along to you and let you choose.<br>
    <br>
    At the present time, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
    is regarded as the default and best of the programs, since it
    appears to work on all supported platforms.&nbsp; <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> presently does not work
    on Mac OS X and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
    presently does not work properly on Windows.&nbsp; Neither <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> nor <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> works on FreeBSD, or at
    least I haven't jumped through whatever hoops might be needed to
    make them work.<br>
    <br>
    As far as joystick selection is concerned, I use a Logitech Extreme
    3D Pro, and all configuration defaults have been tailored for that
    model.&nbsp; In theory, any twist-handle joystick should be usable,
    though possibly with some reconfiguration.&nbsp; Only the most basic
    3D joystick is needed, since only 3 degrees of freedom (roll, pitch,
    and yaw) are used, and no buttons are used.<br>
    <br>
    Selection between <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> and reconfiguration
    related to different joystick models <span style="font-style:
      italic;">can</span> be done from a command-line, but to me that
    seems to be making a difficult chore even more difficult than it
    needs to be.&nbsp; So I've provided a GUI front-end (<span
      style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span>) for this chore, as
    described in the next section.
    <h3><a name="Joystick_configuration_for_use_with_the"
        id="Joystick_configuration_for_use_with_the"></a>jWiz, the GUI
      front-end for joystick configuration<br>
    </h3>
    As mentioned above, three separate joystick-handler programs are
    provided, and we <span style="font-style: italic;">hope</span> that
    by default the best one of them is automatically used by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> and that the default
    joystick settings of that joystick-handler program are
    correct.&nbsp; But what if they're not?&nbsp; Then you have to do a
    little work to correct the joystick settings.&nbsp; On the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> main screen, you may
    have noticed an unexplained button labeled "Handler":<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 344px; height:
        219px;" alt="" src="Screenshot-handler-detail.jpg" width="344"
        height="219"><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> In the screenshot above, this
        button is disabled because the "Attitude Controller Assembly"
        checkbox is empty.&nbsp; If it was checked, then the button
        would be enabled, and if you clicked the button a screen like
        this would appear:<br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 1017px;
            height: 537px;" alt="" src="Screenshot-jWiz.jpg"
            width="1017" height="537"><br>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    This is the main screen for a program <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">jWiz</span>, which helps guide you through the joystick
    reconfiguration process.&nbsp; At "Step #1", "Step #2", and "Step
    #3" you can configure one of the three joystick handlers.&nbsp; You
    only need to configure one of them, since only one of them can be
    used by the simulation at any given time.&nbsp; Step #1 is the
    preferred handler, and if it doesn't work for you then you can
    proceed to the next-best handler at Step #2, and if that doesn't
    work for you then you can proceed to the fallback handler at Step
    #3.&nbsp; Not all of these steps will necessarily be available to
    you, since some of the handlers don't work on some operating
    systems, and therefore may be grayed out and disabled.<br>
    <br>
    The big red checkmark on "Step #1" indicates that the primary
    joystick-handler is currently set and will be used by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp; If you change
    the setup, then the checkmark moves to a different handler.<br>
    <br>
    Wherever there is a "Default" button, you can use it to restore the
    settings for that handler to their original defaults.&nbsp; Wherever
    there is a "Test/Set" button, it allows you to both test the
    joystick configuration for that handler and (at the same time) set
    it for use by <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp;

    Where there are separate "Test" and "Set" buttons, it means that the
    settings for that handler can be tested without selecting that
    handler for use by <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>,
    and that you have to click the "Set" button as an extra step after
    testing.<br>
    <br>
    When you click one of the "Test" or "Test/Set" buttons, one of the
    following windows will open up:<br>
    <br>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    You'll notice, I'm sure, that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>,
    which had no adjustable parameters on the main <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> screen, has adustable
    parameters as well as "Default" and "Set" buttons, so all three
    handlers have effectively the same kinds of adjustments.&nbsp; One
    difference is that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> have only two
    adjustable parameters ("Axis number"/"Axis" and "Polarity"/"Sense")
    while <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> has four
    adjustable parameters ("Stick", "Axis", "Scale", and
    "Offset").&nbsp; Thus, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
    is harder to configure than the others, which is part of the reason
    the others are preferred.<br>
    <br>
    But the three handlers are all similar in that they display the
    current pitch, roll, and yaw readings.&nbsp; The aim is to find an
    appropriate combination of settings so that:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Maximum left roll is -57.</li>
      <li>Maximum right roll is +57.</li>
      <li>Maximum downward pitch is -57.</li>
      <li>Maximum upward pitch is +57.</li>
      <li>Maximum right yaw is -57.</li>
      <li>Maximum left yaw is +57.</li>
    </ul>
    You can experiment with the settings directly in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> (by hitting the "Set"
    button for every combination of settings you want to test), but in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> or <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> you need to exit and
    return to <span style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> every time
    you want to change the settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mac OS X, by the
    way, these screens are shown to you inside of a program called <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span>, and you need to exit
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> from its main
    menu.<br>
    <br>
    For most joysticks, you should find that the pitch and roll settings
    are correct, or very nearly so, but that there is less certainty
    about the yaw settings.&nbsp; Therefore, I'll discuss only how to
    change the yaw settings; for the pitch and roll settings, the
    principles are identical.&nbsp; Here is the procedure I'd recommend:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>If there is no movement of the joystick that can cause the yaw
        value to change, then it probably means the wrong axis is
        set.&nbsp; In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, the
        joystick has a collection of axes, identified as 0, 1, 2,
        ....&nbsp; The numbering is a little different in <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, where the joystick
        has a collection of "sticks" 0, 1, 2, ..., each one of which has
        two "axes" 0 and 1.&nbsp; For example, if you look at the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACAx</span> screenshots above,
        you'll see that my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro has either 6 axes or
        else 3 sticks of two axes each.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
        principle is the same.&nbsp; Any given axis (or stick/axis)
        provides only a single reading—in other words, if it was used
        for roll or pitch, it wouldn't provide a yaw reading—so step
        through the unused axes (or stick/axis pairs) until you find the
        one whose readings change with yaw.&nbsp; If there is no such
        setting, try a different joystick handler.</li>
      <li>If the sense of an axis is wrong—i.e., if the yaw increases
        where it should decrease and vice versa—then the "Polarity" or
        "Sense" of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> or <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> is wrong, or the
        algebraic sign of the "Scale" is wrong for <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>.&nbsp; Change plus to
        minus or minus to plus.</li>
      <li>If the readings are not symmetric about zero—e.g., if the
        readings were 0 to 255 rather than -128 to +127—then the
        "Offset" in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> is
        wrong.&nbsp; Change the Offset to equal the center of the range
        you are observing.&nbsp; (This problem cannot occur in <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> or <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, so there is no
        adjustment needed for them.)</li>
      <li>If the size of the range is wrong—e.g., if the reading varies
        from -128 to 127 rather than from -57 to +57—then the "Scale" in
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> is wrong.&nbsp;
        The Scale is a multiplier in units of 0.01, so a Scale of 100
        has no effect, a Scale less than 100 (in magnitude) decreases
        the size of the range, and a Scale greater than 100 increases
        the size of the range.&nbsp; (Again, this problem cannot occur
        in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> or <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, so there is no
        adjustment needed for them.)</li>
    </ol>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Once you're all done configuring
      within <span style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span>, a partial
      double-check can be made by running the simulation itself after
      doing this configuration.&nbsp; One of the items in the LM
      telemetry display is the current octal value of input channel 31,
      part of which indicates the direction (but not the magnitude) of
      displacement of the ACA from its detent.&nbsp; The last two octal
      digits are:<br>
    </span>
    <ul>
      <li>75 for pitch down</li>
      <li>76 for pitch up</li>
      <li>37 for roll left</li>
      <li>57 for roll right</li>
      <li>73 for yaw left</li>
      <li>67 for yaw right</li>
    </ul>
    So you should be able to move the joystick and see the downlink
    telemetry change accordingly, keeping in mind of course that the
    telemetry downlink occurs at several-second intervals and so the
    telemetry display can't respond instantly to joystick movements.<br>
    <h3><a name="How_the_selection_and_configuration"
        id="How_the_selection_and_configuration"></a>How the selection
      and configuration process works<br>
    </h3>
    If you wish to bypass <span style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span>
    for some reason, and to configure joysticks from the command line,
    it's certainly possible to do so.&nbsp; The principle involved is
    that each of the three programs <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>,
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> store their configuration
    parameters in files (respectively, yaACA-0.cfg, yaACA2-0.cfg, and
    yaACA3-0.cfg).&nbsp; These configuration parameters are selected by
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> GUI or from the
    command-line for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>/<span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>, but once safely stored
    in the configuration files the command-line parameters are no longer
    needed.&nbsp; (The details of the command-line parameters are
    described in the following 3 sections.)&nbsp; What VirtualAGC does
    is simply to choose which <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA<span
        style="font-style: italic;">x</span></span> program is needed on
    the basis of what configuration files it finds:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If yaACA2-0.cfg exists, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>
        is used; otherwise,</li>
      <li>If yaACA-0.cfg exists, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
        is used; otherwise,</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> is used,
        whether or not yaACA3-0.cfg exists.&nbsp; (If yaACA3-0.cfg
        doesn't exist, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
        uses its own built-in configuration defaults.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Creating the configuration files is a matter of running the
    appropriate <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACAx</span> program
    with the desired command-line switches.&nbsp; Getting rid of
    configuration files is a simple matter of deletion.&nbsp; However,
    actually running the appropriate <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACAx</span>
    program isn't always so simple because you have to be in the proper
    working directory, and have to supply the proper path for the
    program, as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>From a command line, 'cd' to <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>'s

        working directory.&nbsp; This happens to be the directory in
        which the configuration files mentioned above are stored.&nbsp;
        If you have installed in the default locations, the command will
        be:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">In Linux or FreeBSD:</span>&nbsp;

          <span style="font-family: monospace;">cd
            ~/VirtualAGC/Resources</span></li>

            AGC\Resources"</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">In Mac OS X:&nbsp;</span>
          <span style="font-family: monospace;">cd
            ~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources</span></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Attach your 3D joystick.</li>
      <li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, and <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> with your chosen
        command-line options.&nbsp; The only relevant options are
        --pitch, --roll, and --yaw, as described below <a
          href="#Usage_of_yaACA2">for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span></a>
        or <a href="#Usage_of_yaACA3">for <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">yaACA3</span></a>.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">yaACA2</span> needs no switches, since you select the
        options from its own built-in GUI.&nbsp; The appropriate command
        lines will be:</li>

          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>, you need to exit the
        program and re-run it.&nbsp; To exit, hit the Ctrl-C key on your
        keyboard.&nbsp; On Mac OS X, you will also need to close the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> program from its
        menu.)&nbsp; You need to try different combinations until you
        see the following readings printed out when moving the joystick:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Maximum left roll is -57.</li>
        <li>Maximum right roll is +57.</li>
        <li>Maximum downward pitch is -57.</li>
        <li>Maximum upward pitch is +57.</li>
        <li>Maximum right yaw is -57.</li>
        <li>Maximum left yaw is +57.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Note that <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> display joystick
      readings as translated to the range acceptable to</span> <span
      style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">the AGC (namely, -57-+57).</span><span
      style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:

        style="font-style: italic;">both</span> the raw readings
      obtained from the joystick (usually 0-255 or else -128-+128) <span
        style="font-style: italic;">and</span> the translated
      readings.&nbsp; The latter will appear in parentheses following
      the former, and are the ones which you need to check.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      A partial double-check can be made by running the simulation
      itself after doing this configuration.&nbsp; One of the items in
      the LM telemetry display is the current octal value of input
      channel 31, part of which indicates the direction (but not the
      magnitude) of displacement of the ACA from its detent.&nbsp; The
      last two octal digits are:<br>
    </span>
    <ul>
      <li>75 for pitch down</li>
      <li>76 for pitch up</li>
      <li>37 for roll left</li>
      <li>57 for roll right</li>
      <li>73 for yaw left</li>
      <li>67 for yaw right</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, note that (in theory) multiple joystick controllers could
    be attached to the computer, and that each of the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaACAx</span> programs allows access to
    these different joystick controllers.&nbsp; The configuration files
    are separate for the different joystick controllers so that (for
    example) if joystick controller 1 was used, then the configuration
    files would have a name like yaACA3-1.cfg rather than
    yaACA3-0.cfg.&nbsp; However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    make no such provision:&nbsp; it always assumes that joystick
    controller 0 is used.&nbsp; Therefore, to use a different controller
    you will have to bypass <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    and use your own startup procedure for the simulation.<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> These options allow you to
      configure how the roll/pitch/yaw degrees of freedom map to the
      "axes" of the joystick as recognized by the computer's operating
      system.&nbsp; In general, the operating system views a 3D joystick
      as possessing a certain number of axes, identified as axis 0, axis
      1, etc.&nbsp; I deduce from my readings that axis 0 will almost
      always correspond to roll and axis 1 will almost always correspond
      to pitch.&nbsp; However, the axis used for yaw is likely to
      vary.&nbsp; For example, I have seen cases where it is 2 and cases
      where it is 3.&nbsp; I have chosen defaults based strictly on my
      own convenience (i.e., for my Logitech Extreme 3D pro joystick),
      and I have no theoretical basis for assuming that they'll work for
      you.&nbsp; In addition to choosing which axis belongs to which
      degree of freedom, these command-line switches also allow you to
      choose the <span style="font-style: italic;">sense</span>.&nbsp;
      For example, you may indeed find that axis 1 corresponds to pitch,
      but that it pitches up where you expect it to pitch down, and
      vice-versa.&nbsp; In this case, simply put a minus sign before the
      number, as in "--pitch=-1".&nbsp; (And if you have to do this for
      axis 0, don't worry:&nbsp; "--roll=-0" treated differently than
      "--roll=0"!)<br>

    In normal use the AGC periodically transmitted telemetry information
    which was displayed on monitors in Mission Control.&nbsp; Naturally
    the virtual <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
    periodically transmits telemetry data as well, using virtual radio
    waves, and with appropriate software to simulate a ground-based
    receiver it is possible to view this information.&nbsp; The
    characteristics of the digital uplink and downlink can be explored
    by reading section 2 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Guidance


      System Operations Plan</span> (GSOP) for the <a
      href="NARA-SW/R-567-sec2-rev8.pdf">LM</a> or the <a
      href="NARA-SW/R-577-sec2-rev2.pdf">CM</a>.&nbsp; The data consists
    of a conglomeration of many of the internal state variables used by
    the AGC, and is capable of conveniently giving a much more detailed
    picture of the state of the AGC and of the spacecraft than the AGC
    can give to the astronauts.<br>
    <br>
    Prior to the creation of a dedicated <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaTelemetry</span> program, I cobbled telemetry-viewing
    capability onto the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
    program, even though it is completely unrelated functionality.&nbsp;
    If <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> is started with
    the switches <a href="yaDSKY.html#TestUplink">"--test-downlink"
      and/or "--test-uplink"</a>, then you can use it to view the
    digital downlinks or to create uplink data, respectively.&nbsp;
    Using <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> in this way
    has several drawbacks.&nbsp; One drawback is that some people like
    to use an alternate DSKY simulation (such as the "DSKY Lite" built
    into <a href="#LM_Simulator_by_Stephan_Hotto">Stephan Hotto's <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span></a> described
    above), rather than to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>,
    and in those cases <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
    isn't present.&nbsp; Another drawback is that to see the downlink
    data, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> must be
    started in a console of an appropriate size and on some platforms
    (Windows, Mac OS X 10.4) this is either not possible, or else (Mac
    OS X 10.5) not possible without running the X-window system.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>, on the other
    hand, is a dedicated program that does nothing other than to provide
    a monitor for displaying telemetry information downlinked from the
    AGC.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The accompanying photo is actually not a photo of a mission-control
    CRT; rather, it is a screen capture from the "Apollo 11" episode of
    the great HBO mini-series <span style="font-style: italic;">From
      the Earth to the Moon</span>.&nbsp; You can appreciate the care
    that the creators of the show must have taken with this, since many
    of the items on the screen clearly do relate to downlinked
    data.&nbsp; If you enlarge the image by clicking on it, and squint
    at the upper left-hand corner of the display, you'll note that it
    refers to LM099; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    version 099 was the AGC software build used for Apollo 11.&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, however convincing the film-makers' art was, this
    display does not seem to match any of the documented records we've
    found of the appearance of the actual mission control CRT
    displays.&nbsp; At present, what you get with <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> (or <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>) is simply a list of all
    variables and their values appearing in the downlinked data
    stream.&nbsp; I hope to provide more accurate display formats in the
    future.<br>
    <br clear="all">
    In addition to telemetry downlinks—i.e., reception by ground control
    of data from the AGC—digital uplinks are also possible.&nbsp;
    Uplinks were (and continue in the virtual system to be) handled by
    the simple expedient of transmitting <a href="yaDSKY.html">DSKY</a>
    keycodes, encoded in a triply-redundant format to allow detection of
    errors.&nbsp; The AGC flight software treats DSKY and uplink
    keycodes in a very similar fashion, so ground control could remotely
    perform any task which the astronaut could perform at the DSKY
    keypad, including data entry, entry of short program patches into
    memory, and activation of programs.&nbsp; At the present time, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> doesn't attempt to
    duplicate this uplink capability, but <a
      href="#Getting_the_Simulation_to_a_Known_State">VirtualAGC does
      provide a handy mode for uplinking</a>.&nbsp; Also, the
    "--test-uplink" switch for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
    causes keycodes to be transmitted to the AGC via the digital-uplink
    data-stream rather than via the virtual wiring it normally uses, and
    thus provides a proof-of-concept that the uplink is implemented
    correctly.&nbsp; It would be interesting to know what kind of
    equipment mission control used for this purpose.&nbsp; Perhaps they
    used an actual DSKY.<br>
    <br>
    But enough about <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
    already!&nbsp; As far as <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>
    is concerned, the usage-syntax is:<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> does not
      immediately begin attempting to communicate with <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp; The current
      defaults are 500 ms. in Win32 and 0 ms. otherwise (Linux/Mac OS

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaTelemetry</span> program and the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> Apollo Guidance Computer
      simulation exist in a "client/server" relationship, in which the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> program needs to
      be aware of the IP address or symbolic name of the host computer
      running the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
      program.&nbsp; By default, this is "localhost", meaning that both
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> are running on the same
      computer.<br>

    <span style="font-family: monospace;">--port=<span
        style="font-style: italic;">Portnumber</span></span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> By default, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> attempts to
      connect to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
      program using port number 19800.&nbsp; However, if more than one
      instance of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>
      is being run, or if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
      has been configured to listen on different ports, then different
      port settings for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>
      are needed.&nbsp; Note that by default, <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaAGC</span> listens for new connections on ports
      19697-19706, which is the recommended range for virtual CM
      equipment, but that the recommended port range when using <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> for the LM is
      19797-19806.&nbsp; Thus, yaTelemetry would normally used either
      with port 19800 (LM) or 19700 (CM).<br>

    </span> <span style="font-family: monospace;">--spacecraft=LM</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Self-explanatory, I think.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">--font-size=<span
        style="font-style: italic;">Points</span></span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaTelemetry</span> display window is not provided in a
      way that allows it to be resized.&nbsp; This means that if
      downlink data does not fit within the display window, the only
      option is to change the size of the text, and not to change the
      size of the window.&nbsp; The default font size is chosen with the
      expectation that adjustment isn't needed.&nbsp; However, it's
      possible that the default won't be appropriate on some platforms,
      so adjustment can be achieved via the --font-size switch.&nbsp;
      Because of platform variations, the default size actually varies
      from platform to platform (Linux, Windows, Mac) and according to
      whether or not the --simple switch (see below) is used.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">--undecorated</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>
      is gimicked-up to look something like a CRT display.&nbsp;
      However, this takes a lot of space on the computer screen, and you
      may be unwilling to expend the extra space needed to achieve this
      retro appearance.&nbsp; The --undecorated switch removes the
      decorations, and reduces the telemetry display to little more than
      a rectangle filled with text.&nbsp; If the screen size is too
      small to display the decorations, this switch is activated
      automatically and so you do not need to do so manually.&nbsp;
      Also, the switch is always in effect in Mac OS X, because the
      decorated display has not (yet) been made to work correctly.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">--simple</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Although by default <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> displays its
      downlink-data within a console intended to resemble a CRT, and
      although the --undecorated switch is available to remove that
      decorative trimming, the --simple switch is probably a better
      choice in practice.&nbsp; The --simple switch overrides both the
      default and the --undecorated mode to provide a simple textual
      display with no flourishes except for two buttons which can
      enlarge the font size or decrease it.&nbsp; The size of the
      display is always automatically adjusted so that the downlink data
      always appears within it without scrollbars being needed,
      regardless of the font size.&nbsp; I would recommend always using
      the --simple switch in place of the defaults.<br>
