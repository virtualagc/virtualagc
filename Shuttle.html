<h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>


    
<p>Insofar as the Space Shuttle is concerned, the Virtual AGC
      Project's present goals — or if you'd prefer, <i>my</i> goals —
      are the following:<br>
    </p>


    
<ul>


      <li>To provide the complete source code for the software for the
        most-significant of its onboard computer systems, to the extent
        allowed by U.S. law.</li>
      <li>To provide all of the official documentation needed to
        understand that software and to work with it.&nbsp; See the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#References">References</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>To provide development tools suitable for working with the
        software source code, and in particular for compiling/assembling
        it into executable form.</li>
      <li>To provide an emulator suitable for running that executable
        code.</li>
      <li>For the emulator to be integrated into space-flight simulation
        systems such as Orbiter+SSU or FlightGear.</li>
    
</ul>


    
<p>In essence, we'd like to do the same kinds of things for the
      Space Shuttle's onboard computers, and in particular the
      computers' software, as we have done for Apollo's onboard computer
      systems and software.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>I <i>don't</i> pretend to be putting together an
      "everything about the Space Shuttle" site.&nbsp; If you want to
      know about the Space Shuttle's Main Engines (SSME) or Reaction
      Control System (RCS), or hear marvelous facts such as the maximum
      payload size being a 15×60 foot cylinder weighing 65,000 pounds,
      then this is <i>not</i> the place to look.&nbsp; (But that's <i>big</i>,
      isn't it?&nbsp; I never knew.)<br>
    </p>


    
<p>Now, there are various nuances to the statements above, such as
      whether access to source code must be restricted in some ways,
      rather than being freely available.&nbsp; And by "the" source
      code, do I mean <i>all</i> revisions?&nbsp; Do I mean for <i>all</i>
      components of the system?&nbsp; And by "the" development tools, do
      I mean the original ones, or do I mean partial work-alikes?&nbsp;
      And by emulation, do I mean emulation of the entire stack of code,
      or just for some restricted portion of it?&nbsp; And besides
      which, how do I really know which documents may be relevant to
      these matters and which may be completely irrelevant?<br>
    </p>


    
<p>For example, although I explicitly said above that this <i>isn't</i>
      the site to come to if you want to learn about engines (SSME), the
      engines were in fact controlled by a dedicated controller
      containing <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/1985008580.pdf#page=60">two redundant Honeywell
        HDC-601 digital computers</a> ... so shouldn't those computers
      and their software be covered here?<br>
    </p>


    
<p>Answers to those questions will become clear in the sections
      below ... or at least, clearer than they are now.&nbsp; There are
      a lot of gray areas.&nbsp; And I don't pretend to know all of the
      answers yet, so we may need to await future events to have
      a more-complete picture.&nbsp; But there aren't necessarily
      unique, permanently-correct answers anyway.&nbsp; One thing I can
      say unequivocally is that integration into space-flight simulation
      systems is my hope rather than anything that I'll actively
      pursue personally; integration is the prerogative of the developers of those
      space-flight simulators, rather than mine, if they feel it's
      worthwhile for them.&nbsp; But it's a bit premature to worry about that yet.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>The upshot is that my explanation of the Shuttle's computer systems will by
      necessity be rather limited.&nbsp; The system is simply too
      complex, and there are too many resources already available on the
      web for me to suppose that a presentation by a johnny-come-lately
      like me would be worthwhile or even interesting about a topic this
      big.&nbsp; Perhaps the best place to get a general introduction
      would be <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Shuttle/Computers%20in%20Spaceflight%20-%20Chapter%204.pdf">Chapter
























        4, "Computers in the Space Shuttle Avionics System", of James
        Tomayko's <i>Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience</i></a>,
      but there are numerous other documents in <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="links-shuttle.html">our Shuttle
        Library</a> to provide more detail.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>With that said, here's a brief synopsis.&nbsp; As with any
      engineering system of substantial complexity, prepare to descend
      into acronym hell!<br>
    </p>


    
<p>The portion of the Shuttle's full avionics system which primarily
      concerns us is the <i>Data Process System (DPS)</i>, which
      includes the <i>General Purpose Computers (GPC)</i>, the crew
      interface (display and keyboards), the mass-memory units, and the
      data-bus network interconnecting all of them.&nbsp; Here's a
      diagram, swiped from the aforementioned <i>Computers in
        Spaceflight</i>, that gives a very high-level view of the system
      architecture:<br>
    </p>


    
<div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="DPS%20block%20diagram.png" alt="" width="805" height="445"><br>
      <div align="left"><br>
        As you can see, there were five separate GPCs.&nbsp; Each of the
        GPCs was an AP-101S computer, designed and manufactured by IBM's
        Federal Services Division (as were the Apollo LVDC or Gemini
        OBC, though the GPC was not similar to them in any noticeable way).&nbsp; Although I
        may not talk about the AP-101S much, it's worth mentioning that
        it was a kind of embedded version of the IBM System/360
        mainframe, in that it shared roughly the same assembly language,
        known as <i>Basic Assembly Language (BAL)</i>.<br>
        <br>
        Four of the GPCs nominally redundantly ran <i>identical</i>
        software, known as the <i>Primary Flight Software (PFS)</i>
        atop the <i>Flight Control Operating System (FCOS)</i>.&nbsp;
        PFS and FCOS together are collectively referred to as the <i>Primary



















          Avionics Software Subsystem (PASS)</i>.&nbsp; <br>
        <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b> In spite of this
            technical distinction between the acronyms PFS and PASS, I
            find in practice (and have been chided by veterans of the
            Shuttle project) that the term PASS was always used in
            preference to PFS.&nbsp; In other words, people speak of 
PASS vs BFS rather than PFS vs BFS, and stare at you blankly if you 
mention PFS to them.&nbsp; Since that is the common usage, I'm
            going to adopt it throughout the remainder of this article,
            and will not pedantically use the acronym PFS (even though 
it's technically correct) even where the
            distinction vs PASS is significant.</font><br>
        </blockquote>
        Nominally, the behaviors of these four copies of FCOS were synchronized ...
        not on a CPU-cycle by CPU-cycle basis, but to the extent that
        inputs to the GPCs from the spacecraft, as well as commands
        output from the GPCs to the spacecraft, occurred at the same
        time.&nbsp; In particular, the fact that outputs from the GPCs
        were synchronized allowed detection if one of the GPCs was
        behaving abnormally.&nbsp; I say they did this "nominally",
        because this extreme level of redundancy was warranted only
        during critical flight phases ... in particular, during ascent
        and reentry.&nbsp; During the more-leisurely phases of the
        mission, if additional computing power was needed, the four
        principal GPCs did not necessarily need to run identical,
        redundant software.<br>
        <br>
        The fifth GPC instead ran the <i>Backup Flight Software (BFS)</i>,
        created entirely separately from PASS in a clean-room
        fashion.&nbsp; This fifth GPC served roughly the same purpose in
        the Shuttle as the Abort Guidance System (AGS) did in the Apollo
        LM.&nbsp; BFS was specialized for abort functionality, i.e.,
        reentry in the absence of a reliable set of GPCs running
        PASS.&nbsp; And as I said above, this capability was really
        needed only during ascent or reentry.<br>
        <br>The data buses interconnecting the GPCs and peripheral devices, physically and electrically,
        were MIL-STD-1553 buses.<br>
        <br>
        The crew-interface devices included:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>26 line by 51 character displays, capable also of
            displaying some graphics.&nbsp; Prior to about the year
            2000, the pilots had 3 of these displays and the crew
            specialist had 1; they were monochrome (green text on black
            background) cathode-ray tubes (CRTs).&nbsp; After 2000, the
            CRTs were replaced by multi-color liquid crystal displays
            (LCDs), 9 for the pilots and 2 elsewhere.&nbsp;
            Collectively, the CRTs and LCDs were referred to as <i>Multifunction













              Display Units (MDUs)</i>.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
          <li>Keyboards.&nbsp; The pilots had 2 of these, and the
            mission specialist station had a 3rd.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pre-2000 configuration was known collectively as the <i>Multifunction













            CRT Display System (MCDS)</i>, while the post-2000
          configuration was known as the <i>Multifunction Electronic
            Display Subsystem (MEDS)</i>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>In the diagrams below, the pre-2000 configuration is shown on
          the left, while the post-2000 configuration is shown on the
          right.&nbsp; Notice that the LCD-based displays (on the right)
          have 6 buttons along the bottom edges that the CRTs (on the
          left) lack, as well as being taller relative to their
          width.&nbsp; The LCDs continued to display 51×26 textual
          characters, just as the CRTs had, but the text was scrunched
          into the upper part of the screen, while a strip along the
          bottom of the LCD could display additional stuff that the CRTs
          hadn't been able to, such as menu options selectable by the
          edge buttons.&nbsp; These differences were transparent to the
          PASS / BFS flight software, because the additional stuff
          displayed along the bottom was not controlled by the PASS /
          BFS software.&nbsp; In contrast, keyboards were the same in
          type and number throughout the duration of the Shuttle
          program.<br>

        Like the AGC, AGS, and LVDC, which were programmed essentially in
        the assembly language native to their CPU types, the Flight
        Control Operating System (FCOS) and were written in BAL, the assembly language of the AP-101S
        CPU.&nbsp; But once you get past those infrastructural software
        components, the bulk of PASS application code was written in a higher-level
        language called HAL/S, as was the BFS.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/DPS%20Overview%20Workbook.pdf#page=22">The DPS
          Overview Workbook</a> explains the overall structure of PASS
        better than I can:&nbsp; <br>
        <blockquote>"PASS software consists of two types of software:
          system software and application software. System software runs
          the GPC. It is responsible for tasks such as GPC–to–GPC
          communication, loading software from MMUs, and timekeeping
          activities. Application software is software that runs the
          orbiter. This includes software that calculates orbiter
          trajectories and maneuvers, monitors various orbiter systems
          (such as power, communications, and life support), and
          supports mission–specific payload operations. The application
          software is divided into broad functional areas called major
          functions; in turn, each major function consists of
          Operational Sequences (OPS), which are loaded into the GPCs
          for each major phase of flight.<br>
          <br>
          "Finally, each OPS has one or more Major Modes (MMs) that
          address individual events or subphases of the flight."<br></blockquote>
          Schematically, schematically you can see how the application 
software was structures, at least in one version of the flight 
software.&nbsp; Over the decades in which the Shuttle's flight software 
was in use, there were certainly changes to this structure.<br>

<h1><a name="PASS"></a>PASS, BFS, and Other Shuttle Source Code</h1>


    
<p>I have become aware of private individuals with copies of what I
      think may be the complete very-late revisions of the Shuttle's 
flight software, both primary (PFS/PASS) and backup (BFS).&nbsp;
      This is remarkable, given that a former developer of Shuttle
      software has told me that: <br>
    </p>


    
<blockquote>
      <p>"When NASA shut down the Space Shuttle project, they erased all
        of the backup storage media — since there WAS NO REQUIREMENT for
        saving source code!&nbsp; Most of the HAL/S compiler and related
        tools (like ... other support software were not saved), but all
        of the HAL/S-based flight code was preserved."</p>
    </blockquote>


    
<p>In fact, I filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with
 NASA's FOIA Office to get a copy of the flight software from NASA, but 
after several months of looking around they asserted that they didn't 
have a copy of it.&nbsp; So apparently NASA fully lived up to the lack 
of a requirement for preserving it, in spite of the assertion of my 
informant that the flight code had in fact been mysteriously saved 
(somewhere) after all.&nbsp; My developer informant also told me that 
the Shuttle flight-code was the most-expensive software-development 
project of all time.&nbsp; Good job all around, U.S. Government 
agencies, preserving tax-payer investment!<br>
</p>


<p>But I digress.&nbsp; <br>
</p>


<p><i>Unfortunately</i>, identifying that the source code for the 
Shuttle's flight software still exists is not the same thing as saying 
that I've convinced anybody to give me much of it.&nbsp; Without being 
too specific, I will simply say that I presently have some
PASS source-code files in hand, representing a small fraction 
of the total, but that I am not at liberty to show them to you due to 
issues which I hope can eventually be resolved.&nbsp; Indeed, I can't even necessarily <i>tell</i> you yet everything I have managed to acquire.&nbsp; It's an unpleasant situation that I hope and expect to improve over time.<br>
</p>


<p>On the other hand, here is some software source code we <i>do</i> have, and which you can see right now in our source tree:<br>
</p>



    
    
<ul>


      <li>HAL/S-FC — the HAL/S compiler, used to actually compile PASS and BFS.&nbsp; More specifically, <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaShuttle/Source%20Code/PASS.REL32V0">HAL/S-FC release 32V0"</a>, written
        mostly in an enhanced version of the XPL high-level language, with bits in
        BAL (IBM Basic Assembly Language) as well.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Original">More on this below</a>.<br>
</li><li>XCOM — the source code for the original "standard" XPL compiler.&nbsp; Alas, it is guaranteed <i>not</i>
 to compile HAL/S-FC, since HAL/S-FC was written in an enhanced version 
of the XPL language, which I call "XPL/I", but which Intermetrics 
unfortunately continued to call just "XPL".&nbsp; I will persist in 
calling it XPL/I, however, because there are reasons the distinction is 
important.&nbsp; Intermetrics's compiler 
for XPL/I, to the best of my knowledge, has not survived the end of the 
Shuttle program.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are reasons why the source 
code for the standard compiler remains useful, and perhaps those reasons
 will become clear below.<br>
      </li>
</ul>


    
<h1><a name="EBCDIC"></a>Is this the Original Source Code?<br>
</h1>


    
<p>To the extent that we <i>can</i> present the contemporary source code
 for Shuttle-related software here, or to work with it using the tools
 provided on this site, some alterations from the original source code 
files have been needed.&nbsp; We hope that these changes are not 
substantive, but a difference is a difference, and you're entitled to 
know about it if you're interested.<br>
</p>
<p>For one thing, Virtual AGC header blocks, consisting of program 
comments, are added at the top every contemporary file we receive, so 
that you can understand the provenance of the files as much as 
possible.&nbsp;
 These comments are crafted in a way that lets you distinguish such 
"modern" comments from the original contents of the files.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><i>Flight software</i> files, when they become available, are expected to be "anonymized" 
or "depersonalized", so as to remove all personally-identifying 
information related to the original development teams; thus, whenever 
the name or initials of a programmer are discovered in the program 
comments of Shuttle flight software, we have replaced them by a unique 
but impersonal numerical codes.&nbsp; This is at the behest of 
some holders of the original source materials, as a condition for 
obtaining the software.&nbsp; Whether this is a temporary or permanent condition, I cannot say.<br>
</p>
<p>Most significant, I expect, is the fact that the character encoding 
of all contemporary Shuttle source code has been completely 
changed.&nbsp; This necessity arises directly or 
indirectly from the fact, unfortunate from our point of view, that the 
contemporary character-encoding system used was an IBM system called 
EBCDIC 
(Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code), while modern source 
code (as far as I know) is universally encoded using 7-bit ASCII 
(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) or extension of 
it such as UTF-8.&nbsp; But EBCDIC and ASCII are essentially 100% 
incompatible, with only rare, accidental overlaps.&nbsp; The recoding of
 the source-code files from EBCDIC to ASCII has been done before we ever
 received any of the files, and was performed by unknown people, at an 
unknown time, using an unknown process.&nbsp; Nor was it always 
perfectly done, and has required occasional corrections by us.<br>
</p>



<p>Moreover, the EBCDIC vs ASCII issue isn't quite as simple as the 
preceding paragraph suggests, because not all of the EBCDIC characters 
used originally actually have ASCII equivalents.&nbsp; There are special
 considerations regarding how you need to work with HAL/S source code in
 light of those characters not supported by ASCII.<br>
</p>


<p>Here are the general rules:<br>
</p>


<ol>


  <li>HAL/S source code should be encoded using 7-bit ASCII characters.</li>
  <li>Two characters originally used in HAL/S source code and in the 
original documentation, namely the logical-not character "¬" and the 
U.S. cent character "¢", are not present in 7-bit ASCII.&nbsp; So 
instead, we use the ASCII characters "~" and "`", respectively, in place
 of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, every time you might have seen something like "<tt>x </tt><tt>¬= y</tt>" in the original HAL/S source code or documentation, we'd expect "<tt>x ~= y</tt>" instead!
  </li>
  <li>A compiler directive of the form "<tt>D VERSION <i>v</i></tt>" was sometimes used in original HAL/S source code or template-library files.&nbsp; Here, "<i><tt>v</tt></i>" is a numerical version code in the range of 1 through 255, <i>represented as a single EBCDIC character</i>.&nbsp; To reiterate, a <i>single</i>
 character position in this compiler-directive string must represent up 
to a 3-digit version number.&nbsp; The way they did this originally was 
simply to pretend that the version code was the numeric byte encoding 
for a character, and to insert that single-byte numeric code into the 
string.&nbsp; For example, if the version was 1, then instead of using 
the character "1" in the compiler directive, the numerical byte 1 was 
inserted.&nbsp; This would have been legal in EBCDIC, even though rather
 inconvenient since in most cases the character would have been 
unprintable.&nbsp; In ASCII or UTF-8, the problem goes beyond that, and 
such a single-character usage doesn't even represent a valid 
ASCII or UTF-8 character half of the time.&nbsp; So we cannot continue 
to follow this 
odd practice.&nbsp; Our change is to instead require this compiler 
directive to have the form "<tt>D VERSION <i>xx</i></tt>", where <tt><i>xx</i></tt> is a 2-character string of hexadecimal digits.<br>
  </li>
</ol>


<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; With that said, if your 
operating system supports UTF-8 character coding
 rather than simple 7-bit ASCII, you can continue to use "¬" and "¢" in 
HAL/S source code.&nbsp; The compiler transparently converts them to "~"
 and 
"`" during the compilation, and then converts them back to "¬" and "¢" 
in printouts or in messages it displays.&nbsp; In particular, this does 
work fine in Mac OS and Linux, though there may be special 
considerations trying to do this in Microsoft Windows, discussed 
later.&nbsp; In some of the source code we receive, ¬ has instead 
already been replaced by "^".&nbsp; Thus any software we provide also 
silently converts "^" to "~".<br>
</font></p>
</blockquote>A longer explanation is that for some decades now, the most-common character encoding in the U.S. has been 7-bit
      ASCII, 128 characters in all, sometimes called "plain vanilla" ASCII or just 
"ASCII".&nbsp; But since the Space Shuttle's flight software was
 originally developed on IBM
    mainframe systems like System/360, rather than using ASCII used an 
8-bit character-encoding scheme
    called EBCDIC.&nbsp; It's pretty difficult to find any two EBCDIC 
tables that 
agree on all 256 characters, because various IBM systems seemed to have used
 slightly-different versions of EBCDIC.&nbsp; But here are ASCII and 
EBCDIC tables I pulled from 
Wikipedia that give the basic idea:<br>

In UTF-8, the funky characters "¬" and "¢" are
    represented by the <i>2-byte </i>sequences 0xC2 0xAC and 0xC2
    0xA2, respectively, and they don't appear at all among the 128 
characters of ASCII, but do appear among the 256 characters of <i>some</i> versions of EBCDIC.<br>



    
    
<h1><a name="HALS"></a>HAL/S<br>
    </h1>


    
<p>HAL/S?&nbsp; HAL/S was a high-level programming language in which
      the PASS and BFS application software was written.&nbsp; Whereas
      infrastructural software (like operating systems and run-time
      libraries) was written in whatever assembly-languages were native
      to the particular CPUs running that code, which for IBM computers was IBM's so-called Basic Assembly Language (BAL).<br>
    </p>


    
<p>HAL/S was a compiled language, and the HAL/S flight-software
      source code was compiled down to a machine-code executable before
      it could be run.&nbsp; Compilers existed for it that could be used
      on several different types of computers.&nbsp; Some of the
      compilers produced code that could be run on an IBM System/360
      mainframe; others could produce executable code for the Shuttle's
      IBM AP-101S onboard computers; for all I know, others produced
      executable code for other computers. <br>
    </p>


    
<p>I'm sure you can't help but notice that "HAL" was the name of the
      computer in the movie <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, which came
      out in 1968, not too many years before the HAL/S language was
      invented.&nbsp; In the movie, H.A.L. stood for "Heuristic
      Algorithmic Logic", and many people have observed that H.A.L. was
      just one letter away from I.B.M.&nbsp; (I.e., "H" is one letter
      before "I" in the alphabet, "A" is one letter before "B", and "L"
      is one letter before "M".)&nbsp; The writer of the movie, Arthur
      C. Clarke, maintained that that was simply a coincidence.&nbsp;
      Where the "HAL" in HAL/S comes from has likewise been explained in
      several ways, none of them relating to <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>.&nbsp;












      The HAL/S language was invented (and the flight software was
      written) by a company called Intermetrics, many of whose employees
      were refugees from the same Draper Laboratories (MIT
      Instrumentation Laboratory) at which the Apollo flight software
      had been written.&nbsp; One of those refugees was Ed Copps, one of
      Intermetrics's founders, who is said to have named the HAL/S
      language in honor of Hal Laning, perhaps the most-prominent among
      the designers of the Apollo Guidance Computer's hardware.&nbsp;
      Others offer the explanation that HAL/S is an acronym for
      "High-order Assembly Language / Shuttle".&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/20120013307.pdf">Still
        others</a> state that "the acronym 'HAL' was never formally
      defined".&nbsp; I have even seen one report (NASA-CR-141758) that 
refers to it as "Houston Aerospace Language".&nbsp; Well, who 
knows?&nbsp; It's fun to make up your
      own mind about which constellation of facts matches your own
      preferences.&nbsp; Probably <i>not</i> Houston Aerospace Language!&nbsp; But all I can really say for sure is that there's
      nothing "heuristic" about HAL/S, even if <i>2001</i> may secretly
      have been somewhere in the back of somebody's mind.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>But I digress.&nbsp; As I was saying, the HAL/S software for the
      Shuttle's PASS and BFS still survives in private stashes, which is
      much better than the alternative of it not existing 
anywhere.&nbsp; But I have very little of it as of yet, and am enjoined 
to keep that which I do have private.&nbsp; Whether or not I can get
      any more of it — and the extent to which I'm required to keep it 
private after I get it — depends very much on the kindness of strangers.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>Assuming that we can eventually get access to it, working with
      the application software's source code requires knowledge of the
      HAL/S language.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have a fair amount of
      documentation of that:<br>

      <li>The recommended starting point is "<a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/Programming%20in%20HAL_S%20Sept%201978.pdf">Programming






















          in HAL/S</a>" by Michael Ryer, which was intended as an introduction to
        programming in HAL/S and is organized as a tutorial.</li>
<li>A great supplement to Ryer is the course material for "<a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/Courses/Basic%20HAL-S%20Programming%20Course/CourseSlides.pdf">Basic HAL/S Programming</a>" by Craig Schulenberg.&nbsp; Additional material associated with that course can be found on our Shuttle library page.<br>
</li>

      <li>Ryer's book points out that it is not a definitive
        exposition of the language, and recommends proceeding afterward
        to the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/HAL_S%20Language%20Specification%20Nov%202005.pdf">"HAL/S






















          Language Specification"</a>, which contains a much-more-formal
        specification of the language syntax, both in the form of graphs
        of the syntax and in Backus-Naur form (BNF).</li>
      <li>Or to the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/HAL_S%20Programmers%20Guide%20Nov%202005.pdf">"HAL/S






















          Programmer's Guide"</a>.</li>
      <li>And then there's the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/HAL_S-FC%20User's%20Manual%20Nov%202005.pdf">"HAL/S-FC






















          User's Guide"</a> explains how to compile and execute a HAL/S
        program.&nbsp; That explanation is, of course, completely
        irrelevant to our present situation, but you may find that the
        document answers some questions left unanswered by the preceding
        documents.&nbsp; (You many notice as well that our library
        contains a "HAL/S-360 User's Guide"; that's simply a predecessor
        of the "HAL/S-FC User's Guide".&nbsp; The former assumes that
        the computer on which the compiler ran was an IBM-360, while the
        latter assumed it was some arbitrary "mainframe" to which the
        compiler had been ported.)<br>

<p>We actually have quite a few revisions of some of these documents in our library, spanning the mid-1970's to the
      mid-2000's, though I've only chosen to link the latest versions of
      those documents above, even though from time to time the latest revision isn't always the most complete one.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>


    
<p>Here's a brief sample of HAL/S code from "Programming in HAL/S",
      just to give you its flavor:<br>
    </p>


    
<blockquote>
      <p><tt>&nbsp; FACTORIAL:</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp; PROGRAM;</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DECLARE INTEGER,</tt><tt><br>

        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(6) 'FACTORIAL=', RESULT;</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp; CLOSE FACTORIAL;</tt><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>


    
<p>What this program does is to read a number (<tt>N_MAX</tt>),
      compute its mathematical factorial, then output the result.&nbsp;
      While I won't dissect this short program in detail, I can make a
      couple of observations.&nbsp; For one, the language is <i>strongly













        typed</i>, meaning that every variable has a type that's
      declared at compile time, and that storage for it is fixed and
      unalterable at run-time.&nbsp; Nor is there any dynamic memory
      allocation (as well as no stack and no recursion), so RAM usage is
      completely known at compile time.&nbsp; HAL/S programs <i>never</i>
      unexpectedly abort because memory has filled up.&nbsp; The other
      observation is that the <tt>READ(5)</tt> and <tt>WRITE(6)</tt>
      statements are very familiar to FORTRAN users ... or at least to
      FORTRAN users of (say we say?) a certain vintage.&nbsp; In
      FORTRAN-speak, the 5 and 6 are "logical unit numbers" (LUN) whose
      specific interpretation as keyboard and printer (or keyboard and
      display, or even as files) are assigned externally by the
      Job Control Language (JCL) used to run the job.&nbsp; This
      reflects the fact that the first HAL compilers targeted IBM 360
      computers rather than the Shuttle's computers.&nbsp; In the
      Shuttle software, these <tt>READ</tt> and <tt>WRITE</tt>
      constructs, I <i>think</i>, wouldn't have been used, and keyboard input or display
      output would instead have been handled by calls to the run-time
      library.<br>
    </p>


    HAL/S actually has many novel features not visible in the <tt>FACTORIAL</tt>
    example, such as those devoted to real-time response and scheduling
    of execution.&nbsp; Again, I won't get into most of those here.&nbsp;
    <br>


<br>


With that said, perhaps the most-novel feature is a superficial one, namely the
    ability to express mathematical formulae in a multi-line format that
    the language's designers felt was more self-documenting than the
    usual single-line manner of expressing mathematical formulae in
    programming languages.&nbsp; One comment made several times in the
    documentation is that it's worthwhile for the programmer to spend
    more time than one is usually inclined to do to make the source code
    easy to read ... because more time will eventually be spend reading
    the code than was spent writing it.&nbsp; I.e., the time lost in creating
    readable code is more than made up for by the savings in maintaining
    the code later.&nbsp; This is sound engineering doctrine, according
    to the software-design literature of the time ... but very far from
    <i>today's</i> actual practice and attitudes (2022), in which the
    initial design schedule is everything, and downstream maintenance is
    an afterthought performed by somebody management doesn't have to
    budget time or money for <i>today</i>.&nbsp; That turns out not to be a problem for HAL/S, though, because while you <i>could</i>
 input source-code in this multi-line format, you weren't required to, 
and usually did not do so.&nbsp; But, the compiler always used the 
multi-line format in its output listings, so you got the benefit of 
reading it without the hassle of writing it.<br>


<br>


So were the HAL/S
    designers on the right side or the wrong side of history in this respect?&nbsp;
    (That's an exercise for the reader.) <br>


    <br>


    What the multi-line format mainly does is to allow a more-natural
    representations of superscripts and subscripts.&nbsp; Here's a HAL/S
    sample that illustrates the multi-line pseudo-mathematical format:<br>


    
<blockquote><tt>C Compute corners of a parallelogram.<br>

      </tt><tt>M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(6) AB, BC, CD, DA;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp; CLOSE CORNERS;</tt><br>
    </blockquote>


    What this example program does is to allow input of parameters
    describing a parallelogram — namely, the lengths of a "short" side
    and a "long" side (which is assumed to be along the <i>x</i>-axis),
    and the angle between them in radians — and then to output the (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)
    coordinates of the four corners.&nbsp; The code also illustrates
    another of HAL/S's novel features, in that it can do arithmetic not
    just on scalar variables like integers or floats, but also do vector
    arithmetic or even matrix arithmetic. For example, vector/matrix
    addition or subtraction, vector dot products or cross products,
    matrix multiplication or inversion, etc.&nbsp; Functions like <tt>COS</tt>
    or <tt>SIN</tt> or <tt>VECTOR<sub>2</sub></tt> (which forms a
    2-vector from two scalar inputs) were available in the run-time
    library or as compile-time arithmetic when appropriate.<br>


    <br>


    It's important to realize that the lines with the leading characters
    <tt>E</tt>, <tt>M</tt>, and <tt>S</tt> in the example above are
    active code rather than merely program comments.&nbsp; In HAL/S,
    column 1 has a special purpose.&nbsp; Normally that column is
    blank.&nbsp; True, if a <tt>C</tt> appears there, it actually <i>is</i>
    a full-line comment, just like in Fortran.&nbsp; If a <tt>D</tt> appears there, then the
    line is a compiler directive.&nbsp; But for a multi-line
    mathematical form, <tt>M</tt> in column 1 indicates the formula's
    "main" line, whereas <tt>E</tt> indicates an "exponent" line and <tt>S</tt>
    indicates a "subscript" line.&nbsp; You can see that several places
    above.&nbsp; When this multi-line math format is discussed, it's
    generally described as a "3-line" format.&nbsp; But in fact, there
    was no limit to the number of <tt>E</tt> or <tt>S</tt> lines
    associated with a given <tt>M</tt> line.&nbsp; For example, here's
    some valid code:<br>


    
<blockquote>
      <div class="moz-cite-prefix">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
        <div class="moz-cite-prefix"><tt>E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;












            DEX$J<br>
          </tt></div>
        <tt> </tt>
        <div class="moz-cite-prefix"><tt>E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;












            I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;











            I<br>
          </tt></div>
        <tt> </tt>
        <div class="moz-cite-prefix"><tt>M&nbsp;&nbsp;
            COEF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            ALPHA<br>
          </tt></div>
        <tt> </tt>
        <div class="moz-cite-prefix"><tt>S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;












            L<br>
          </tt></div>
        <tt> </tt>
        <div class="moz-cite-prefix"><tt>S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


































            M**2</tt></div>
      </div>
    </blockquote>


    But you'll notice that if you have a subscript in an <tt>E</tt>
    line or an exponent in an <tt>S</tt> line (as in <tt>DEX$J</tt> or
    <tt>M**2</tt> above), you just have to live with <i>those</i>
    little bits remaining in single-line notation.&nbsp; (In fact,
    there's not even <i>any</i> real need to put an <tt>M</tt> in
    column 1 for a main line, since the <tt>M</tt> meant exactly the
    same thing to the original compilers as a blank in column 1.&nbsp;
    I'm told — thank heaven! — that nobody ever actually did omit the <tt>M</tt>'s.)<br>


    <br>


    In the multi-line math format, if a variable (like <tt>AB</tt>) has
    a '-' above it, that means that <tt>AB</tt> is really a
    vector.&nbsp; Actually, a 2-vector, in the example code above.&nbsp;
    That's reflected in the declaration "<tt>DECLARE VECTOR(2), AB, ...</tt>".











    <br>


    <br>


    And '<tt>-</tt>' isn't the only datatype-related character that can
    appear in the <tt>E</tt> line above a variable in the <tt>M</tt>
    line:<br>


    
<ul>


      <li>'<tt>-</tt>' for vectors.</li>
      <li>'<tt>*</tt>' for matrices.</li>
      <li>'<tt>,</tt>' for strings.</li>
      <li>'<tt>.</tt>' for booleans.</li>
      <li>'<tt>+</tt>' for structures.<br>
      </li>
    
</ul>


    Collectively, these were referred to as "overpunches".<br>


<br>


My impression is that creating source code in this multi-line format
    is a pain in the neck, since aligning the columns cards isn't that
    easy.&nbsp; But as I said, HAL/S doesn't actually <i>require</i> the
    use of this <tt>E/M/S</tt> multi-line format for (input of)
    mathematical formulas.&nbsp; A single-line format is perfectly valid
    as well, and for the <tt>CORNERS</tt> program would look like this:<br>


    
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp; CORNERS: PROGRAM;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DECLARE SCALAR,</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;













        LONG, SHORT, ALPHA;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DECLARE VECTOR(2),</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AB, BC, CD, DA;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; READ(5) LONG, SHORT, ALPHA;</tt><tt><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AB = 0;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BC = VECTOR$2(LONG, 0);<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DA = VECTOR$2(SHORT COS(ALPHA), SHORT
        SIN(ALPHA));<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CD = BC + DA;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(6) AB, BC, CD, DA;<br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp; CLOSE CORNERS;</tt><br>
    </blockquote>


    In the single-line format, The beginning of a subscript is indicated
    by the '<tt>$</tt>' character. <br>


    <br>


    One thing you may take away from this is that the overpunches ('-', '<tt>*</tt>',












    '<tt>+</tt>', ...) which appear on the <tt>E</tt> lines
    to indicate vector vs scalar variables weren't really needed, since
    they don't show up in the single-line notation at all; in fact,
    they're just eye-candy nice for readability, and are actually
    discarded by the compiler.&nbsp; Whereas the subscript '<tt>2</tt>'
    which appears on the <tt>S</tt> line is in fact quite necessary,
    since <tt>VECTOR</tt>() isn't the same thing as <tt>VECTOR<sub>2</sub>()</tt>,
    which isn't the same thing as <tt>VECTOR<sub>3</sub>()</tt>.<br>


<br>


There was also a kind of decoration which the compiler added to 
invocations of "macros", which were string substitutions (like the <tt>#define</tt>
 in C or C++) made on the source code before any actual compilation was 
performed.&nbsp; Such invocations were underlined in printouts.<br>


    <br>


    My guess is that almost all source code was written in the
    single-line format ... and indeed, I've been told by one of the
    original developers that this is so.&nbsp; However, realize that yet
    another novelty of HAL/S is that the original compiler allowed the
    programmer <i>no control whatsoever</i> over the format of the
    output compiler listings.&nbsp; Those were <i>always</i>
    pretty-printed according to the standards decided upon by the
    designers of the compiler.&nbsp; (Well, I think that maybe
    pretty-printing could be turned off, but that doesn't mean the
    person writing the code controlled the format.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>


    <br>


    The same is true of any other formatting decisions.&nbsp; I
    mentioned above that column 1 of the source code has a special
    purpose, and thus it matters what characters appear in column 1 vs
    other columns.&nbsp; But for all lines which have blanks in column
    1, the input source code is completely free-form:&nbsp; Multiple
    statements can appear on a single line.&nbsp; Individual statements
    can be broken across multiple lines.&nbsp; Empty lines and
    whitespaces within lines are ignored, except where at least one
    space is needed between two adjacent identifiers.&nbsp; (And except
    in comments or literal quoted strings.)<br>


    <br>


    The latter point is interesting in connection with the operation of
    multiplication.&nbsp; While HAL/S has the usual operators for a lot
    of mathematical or logical operations, such as "<tt>-</tt>" for
    subtraction, "<tt>/</tt>" for division, "<tt>**</tt>" for
    exponentiation, and so on, <i>it has no operator for multiplication</i>.&nbsp;












    Multiplication is indicated simply by placing variable names,
    constant names, or literal numbers adjacent to each other (separated
    by whitespace).&nbsp; For example, <br>


    
<blockquote><tt>DECLARE SCALAR, X, Y, Z;<br>
        DECLARE INTEGER, I, J, K;<br>
        X = Y Z ;<br>
        I = 2 J K ;<br>
      </tt></blockquote>


    
<p>By the way, <tt>SCALAR</tt> is what HAL/S calls its
      floating-point type; thus <tt>SCALAR</tt> contrasts with <tt>INTEGER</tt>
      or <tt>BOOLEAN</tt> datatypes, but not with <tt>VECTOR</tt> or <tt>MATRIX</tt>.&nbsp;












      In fact, all <tt>VECTOR</tt> and <tt>MATRIX</tt> objects consist
      entirely of <tt>SCALAR</tt> values.&nbsp; You can't have (say) a
      <tt>VECTOR</tt> of <tt>INTEGER</tt> values.&nbsp; On the other
      hand, there is an <tt>ARRAY</tt> type, of arbitrary
      dimensionality, which can hold values of any datatype you like,
      including <tt>VECTOR</tt> and <tt>MATRIX</tt>.&nbsp; And as it
      turns out, there actually is an operator '<tt>*</tt>', but it is
      the vector cross-product operation, not a multiplication of two
      numbers.&nbsp; Similarly, the '<tt>.</tt>' operator is a vector
      dot product.<br>
    </p>


    
<h1><a name="Versioning"></a>Software Versioning</h1>


    
<p>As I've described above, any given shuttle had a number of
      computers, running a lot of different software components — more
      than just the GPCs running PASS/BFS we're discussing here.&nbsp;
      Each of these software components had their own unique
      versioning.&nbsp; I couldn't begin to tell you what those all are;
      I don't even have a list of all the different computers or their
      software components, let alone details about their versions. <br>
    </p>


    
<p>However, in all but the very earliest missions, the <i>collection</i>
      of all of the software components at their various revision levels
      was itself identified by what's called the <i>Operational
        Increment (OI)</i>.&nbsp; You thus see various Shuttle documents
      specifying "OI-24" or "OI-33", and what this means is that those
      documents are specialized to those particular overall software
      versions.&nbsp; The versioning of individual software components
      of the overall software version was apparently by <i>Version
        Increments (VI)</i>, such as "VI 1.23".<br>
    </p>


    
<p>At this point, I have no authoritative single document that links
      software versions to specific Shuttle missions.&nbsp; For what
      information I do have, I'd refer you to the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/20110001406.pdf">Space
        Shuttle Missions Summary</a>.&nbsp; In the following tabulation,
      sorted by software version, notice that a higher STS mission
      number sometimes has a lower software version number, presumably
      partially because the mission numbering doesn't perfectly agree
      with the chronological order in which the missions were
      flown.&nbsp; For that matter, notice confusing duplicate numbers,
      like the entire range STS-26 through STS-33 (skipping STS-29); not
      my fault, blame NASA!<br>

<p>For example, the presentation for <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/STS-121%20FRR%20SE&amp;I.pdf#page=22">the STS-121
        Flight Readiness Review (FRR)</a> tells us that the software
      version was OI-30, in agreement with the table above, while just
      the Integrated Display Processor (IDP) software component was
      version VI 4.01 and the Multifunction Display Unit Function (MDUF)
      was version VI 5.00.<br>
    </p>


    
<h1><a name="Display"></a>Multi-Function Display Formatting and
      Versioning</h1>


    
<p>As was mentioned earlier in the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>, the principal method by
      which the General Purpose Computers (GPC) running the primary
      flight software (PASS) and backup flight software (BFS) interact
      with the crew includes keyboards and display screens.&nbsp; What's
      unusual about the display screens is that what appears on them is
      only <i>partially</i> controlled by the PASS or BFS
      software.&nbsp; Instead, there was another processor sitting
      between each of the displays and the GPCs, and it was this extra
      processor that directly controlled what was displayed and how the
      display was formatted.&nbsp; (For that matter, the keyboards also
      were attached to one of these extra processors rather than to the
      GPCs, so whatever keystrokes were seen by the PASS / BFS software
      had already been pre-digested by these extra processors.)<br>
    </p>


    
<p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="MCDS.png" alt="" width="455" height="278" align="right">In the case of the older, pre-2000
      cockpit configuration (MCDS, 4 CRTs), this extra processor was
      known as the <i>Display Electronics Unit (DEU)</i>, and it
      consisted of an IBM SP-0 CPU with 8K×16 bits of RAM.&nbsp; In the
      case of the newer, post-2000 cockpit configuration (MEDS, 11
      LCDs), the extra processor was known as the Integrated Display
      Processor (IDP), an Intel 368DX microprocessor.&nbsp; The basic
      schema is seen in the diagram to the right.&nbsp; While the
      diagram is specific to the older (MCDS) configuration, the newer
      (MEDS) configuration is conceptually quite similar.&nbsp; In the
      case of the MEDS configuration, the software for the IDP that was
      specifically tasked with formatting the display was called the <i>Display
















        Application Software (DAS)</i>.&nbsp; But these kinds of details
      are of little interest to us in the absence of the DAS or other
      software that actually ran on the DEU/IDPs.&nbsp; So the only use
      of these factoids I'll use in the context of the present
      discussion is to refer from now on to what I've been calling the
      "extra processor" instead as the "DEU/IDP".<br>
    </p>


    
<p>What <i>is</i> of importance to us, however, is that in addition
      to inputs from the GPCs via the MIL-STD-1553 databuses, the
      DEU/IDP's RAM was used to store a set of templates that controlled
      the formatting of the display screen.&nbsp; These templates were
      loaded from mass memory into RAM at power-up.&nbsp; In other
      words, the screen templates are <i>independent</i> of the PASS /
      BFS source code.<br>
    </p>


    For illustrative purposes, there's an example below of the template
    for screen "GNC SYS SUMM 1" for mission STS-96.&nbsp; It comes in
    two varieties, one for the primary flight software, and one for the
    backup flight software: <br>

<p>As you can probably deduce from these images, some of the areas
      are supposed to be updated with data from the GPC (or elsewhere in
      the spacecraft), such as the HH, MM, and SS in the upper-right
      corner or the X's and S's that are all over the place.&nbsp; Other
      markings, like the "SURF", "POS", "MOM", and "DPS" are simply
      features of the template, and don't change at the whim of the GPC
      or more specifically, of PASS or BFS.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>The screen templates don't <i>quite</i> fall under the
      Operational Increment (OI) top-level software-versioning scheme
      we've already discussed.&nbsp; They do, but they are also
      controlled by <i>Program Change Notices (PCN)</i>.&nbsp; The
      examples above are for STS-96 which flew software version OI-27,
      but that doesn't mean that all missions using OI-27 necessarily
      had identical screen templates.&nbsp; In a practical sense, what
      this means is that to know the screen templates and consequent
      display-screen formats for any given Shuttle mission, we must have
      not merely the screen templates for that generic OI, but also the
      differences to those templates that were made due to specific PCNs
      ... and of course, actually have the associated documentation so
      that we can consult it.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>


    
<p>Several documents provide screen templates that can be related to
      one or more missions or software versions.&nbsp; The
      most-available seems to be JSC-48017,&nbsp; the "Data Processing
      System Dictionary".&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="links-shuttle.html#DPS">We have several revisions of
        JSC-48017 in our Shuttle Library</a>, and in principle, if we
      could collect <i>all</i> of the different revisions, then we'd
      have all of the screen templates for all of the missions.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/Space%20Shuttle%20DPS%20Dictionary%20OI-26.pdf">The














        GNC SYS SUMM 1 sample templates above came from one such DPS
        Dictionary</a>.&nbsp; There are also reference-card-like
      summaries that are very helpful, such as <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/Orbiter%20Displays%20Reference%20Guide%20OI-34.pdf">this

















        one for OI-34</a>.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>On the other hand, <i>the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="links-shuttle.html#DPS">Functional Subsystem Software
          Requirements (FSSR)</a></i> documents also contain these
      templates, and seem a lot more authoritative, as well as providing
      a lot more information. In fact, the FSSR goes so far as to give
      screen coordinates for each field, and to explain how every datum
      received by the DEU/IDP via the databus relates specifically to
      each X and S on the display screen!&nbsp; Unfortunately, the FSSRs
      are also a lot more numerous and a lot harder to find than DPS
      Dictionaries are, so the dream of obtaining a complete set of them
      seems more whimsical than obtaining a complete set of DPS
      Dictionaries.&nbsp; Nevertheless, on balance, it seems as though
      the FSSRs should be regarded as the controlling documents for the
      screen templates.&nbsp; We just need to collect all of them, or
      failing that, fall back on DPS Dictionaries when available.&nbsp;
      For example, here are the same GNC SYS SUMM 1 templates, but for
      software version OI-34 (say, mission STS-128), taken from the
      FSSR.&nbsp; They're different than the ones shown above for
      STS-96, though only barely so.&nbsp; Personally, I see only 4
      differences, some sensible, some nonsensical, and some (I suspect)
      misprints; perhaps you can find more.&nbsp; Incidentally, STS-96
      had the MCDS (pre-2000) cockpit configuration, while STS-128 had
      the MEDS (post-2000) cockpit configuration, so perhaps that has
      something to do with the differences.<br>

<h1><a name="Messaging"></a>Computer-to-Peripheral Interface<br>
    </h1>


    
<p>Keyboard data was supplied to the General Purpose Computers
      (GPC), and hence to the PASS/BFS software, by means of messages on
      the MIL-STD-1553 databuses interconnecting the GPCs and
      DEU/IDPs.&nbsp; Similarly, data was output by the GPCs for display
      by passing messages on the databuses as well.&nbsp; Technical
      details about this messaging can be found in the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/JSC-18820%20-%20Rev%20B%20-%20Data%20Processing%20System%20Brief%2019970615.pdf#page=169">Data















        Processing System Brief</a>.&nbsp; I won't bother to summarize
      that information here, since the document's presentation is at
      least as readable as anything I might write up to supplement
      it.&nbsp; While our only available revision of this document so
      far is for the MCDS, recall that the change from the MCDS to MEDS
      cockpit configurations was done in a way that was transparent to
      the existing software.&nbsp; That implies, I hope, that the
      messaging format would have been the same in either configuration.<br>

<h1><a name="Emulation"></a>HAL/S Processing<br>
</h1>To resurrect Space Shuttle flight software to my satisfaction minimally requires achieving the following:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Acquire the full HAL/S source code for the flight software.</li>
  <li>Create a HAL/S compiler (for modern generally-available computers)
 which can produce executable object code for the flight software.</li>
  <li>Create means of emulating the Space Shuttle's computing 
environment well enough to execute the object code generated by the 
compiler.</li>
</ol>
<p>This section concerns itself entirely with the 2nd of these, namely compilation of HAL/S.<br>
</p>
<p>This turns out to be a complicated topic, both because the HAL/S 
language is very complex in comparison to assembly languages like those 
of the Apollo AGC, AGS, or LVDC, but also because it's hard to make an 
effective compiler entirely independently of consideration of how the 
object code will eventually be executed.&nbsp; As a result, compiler 
development has proceeded in fits and starts, with tremendous amounts of
 work being done on one approach or another, only to be eventually 
abandoned in an incomplete state.&nbsp; And yet, the abandoned work 
remains useful in some ways, so I can't truly discard it in good 
conscience.&nbsp; In the next subsection I'll discuss the current 
approach to a HAL/S compiler, while the two subsections thereafter will 
discuss those zombie approaches ... not quite dead, but not quite alive 
either.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="deathbyxpl"></a>Death by XPL</h2>
<p>In my current thinking, the roadmap to a usable HAL/S compiler is this:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Develop a compiler (<b>XCOM-I.py</b>) capable of compiling 
programs written in Intermetrics's extended version of the XPL 
programming language (XPL/I).&nbsp; Development of XCOM-I is proceeding 
rapidly, and it is currently capable of compiling all (or almost all) of
 standard XPL, as well as some XPL/I.&nbsp; It is actually an XPL/I-to-C
 translator.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="XPL.html">See the XCOM-I page</a> for links to XCOM-I, discussion of usage, and so forth.<br>

<p>Emulation, or alternatively generation of object-code for non-IBM-BAL
 computers, is outside the scope of this section.&nbsp; But it would 
presumably either proceed from the HALMAT output of PASS1, or else from 
the BAL output of PASS2.&nbsp; At this point, my vote would be for a 
BAL-to-C translation system.&nbsp; In fact, <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://www.hercules-390.org/">emulators</a> already exist that could <i>presumably</i>
 run IBM System/360 object code generated by PASS2 of the compiler, 
though I don't think that would be of much help in using the code within
 a spacecraft-simulation system. <br>

<h2><a name="Modern"></a> HAL/S Interpreter<br>
</h2>


<i>(This section describes a partially-completed but halted approach 
towards HAL/S compilation and emulation that nevertheless remains useful
 as a tool for learning HAL/S.)</i><br>


<br>


The first (but now halted) of my approaches to a HAL/S compiler actually
 involved both compilation and emulation, and allowed combining those 
two aspects so as to create an interactive HAL/S interpreter.&nbsp; Some
 HAL/S features were not yet implemented when the approach was 
abandoned, but the convenience of being able to interactively enter 
HAL/S statements and immediately see the results of doing so, while at 
the same time being able to interactively examine the values of 
variables or to alter those variables is valuable when used for learning
 about HAL/S.<br>
<br>
As an example, consider the following HAL/S short sample program
    (called <tt>SIMPLE</tt>) which I've adapted from a program in the
    excellent book <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/Programming%20in%20HAL_S%20Sept%201978.pdf"><i>Programming in HAL/S</i></a> (1978) by Michael J.
    Ryer.&nbsp; The program provides an input loop, into which the user
    can enter numbers (<tt>R</tt>) from the keyboard, and then prints
    out <tt>πR<sup>2</sup></tt>. <br>


    
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp; <font color="#663300">SIMPLE: PROGRAM;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; DECLARE PI CONSTANT
        (3.141592653589793);<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; DECLARE R SCALAR;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE(6) 'Input values of R to compute
        PI R**2, or else -1 to quit.';<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; DO WHILE TRUE;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; READ(5) R;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; IF R &lt; 0 THEN
        EXIT;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE(6) 'R =', R,
        'and PI R**2 =', PI R**2;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; END;<br>

        &nbsp; CLOSE SIMPLE;</font></tt><br>
    </blockquote>


    HAL/S considers the <tt>PROGRAM</tt> to be the basic executable
    unit, and thus at runtime the expectation would be that some
    selection of <font color="#663300"><tt>PROGRAM</tt></font>s is running, and possibly
    intercommunicating, and receiving timeslices to do so according to
    the assigned execution-priorities.&nbsp; But with the interpreter,
    we can just bypass all of that infrastructure and compute any values
    we like, directly and immediately, without wrapping our code in a <font color="#663300"><tt>PROGRAM</tt></font>.&nbsp;




    For example, by inputting a couple of hopefully-self-explanatory
    lines of HAL/S code into the interpreter, I get the following<br>


    
<blockquote><font color="#663300"><tt>HAL/S &gt; DECLARE PI CONSTANT (3.141592653589793);</tt><tt><br>

    In case you're wondering, user input that begins with a backtick (<font color="#663300">`</font>)
    is a command to the interpreter itself rather than a statement in the HAL/S language. In this example, <font color="#663300"><tt>`spool</tt></font>
    and <font color="#663300"><tt>`unspool</tt></font> are present to keep the interpreter from
    trying to execute each statement in the definition of the <font color="#663300"><tt>SIMPLE</tt></font>
    program individually, and instead treating them as an entire unit to
    be processed together.&nbsp; Meanwhile, just defining the <font color="#663300"><tt>SIMPLE</tt></font>
    program doesn't cause the <font color="#663300"><tt>SIMPLE</tt></font> program to <i>execute</i>,
    and it's the actual execution that's triggered by <font color="#663300"><tt>`run SIMPLE</tt></font>.&nbsp;




    And of course, <font color="#663300"><tt>SIMPLE</tt></font> doesn't vanish after we've finished
    running it; the interpreter still recalls its definition, and we
    could run it again if we liked:<br>

    While the interpreter is far from complete (or correct!) that's just
    a small sampling of what it can do.&nbsp; I won't elaborate on it
    any more here.&nbsp; If you'd like to experiment with it yourself,
    you should consult <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="hal-s-interpreter.html">the dedicated HAL/S Interpreter</a>
    page for a lot more info on how to go about it.<br>


    <br>


    The interpreter was originally intended to be a compiler that produced object code in an intermediate language I call <i>PALMAT</i>.&nbsp;
 After a PALMAT emulator was also incorporated into the compiler, it 
became possible to use the compiler as an interpreter.&nbsp; The 
definition of the PALMAT language appears in the Appendix of <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="hal-s-compiler.html">a page that was originally intended as a discussion of the (now-abandoned) compiler</a>.&nbsp;
 While understanding of PALMAT isn't really necessary just to use the 
HAL/S interpreter, PALMAT remains a potentially-useful tool for 
emulation of HAL/S programs.<br>
<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b> The reason this approach was 
halted was mainly that it had become to unwieldy to continue adding the 
still-unimplemented features of HAL/S to the compiler portion of 
it.&nbsp; Moreover, I felt that the emulator portion, written in Python,
 while adequate, was slower in execution than I desired and too 
difficult to integrate into spacecraft-simulation software.&nbsp; 
Development on it could still continue someday, if desired.</font><br>

<h2><a name="Original"></a>Port of the Original HAL/S Compiler</h2>


<p><i><i>(This section describes a </i></i>completed<i><i> but now-abandoned approach 
towards HAL/S compilation remains useful
 as a tool for cross-checking other approaches towards HAL/S compilation.)</i>
</i></p>


My second approach to the HAL/S compilation problem was to port the 
original compiler, HAL/S-FC, from XPL/I to Python.&nbsp; HAL/S-FC 
consisted of 7 passes:<br>
<ol>
  <li>PASS1 — Convert XPL/I to the HALMAT intermediate language.<br>
  </li>
  <li>FLOW — Generate reports?<br>
  </li>
  <li>OPT  — Optimize the HALMAT.<br>
  </li>
  <li>AUX  — Optimize the HALMAT.<br>
  </li>
  <li>PASS2  — Convert HALMAT to executable object code for IBM System/360 or IBM APS-100S (Shuttle's onboard computers).<br>
  </li>
  <li>PASS3  — Work with simulation data files (SDF).<br>
  </li>
  <li>PASS4  — Work with simulation data files (SDF).</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; It's unfortunate that the Shuttle's Primary Avionics Software Subsystem (i.e., the flight software) is <i>also</i>
 referred to as "PASS".&nbsp; But do not be confused:&nbsp; PASS1, 
PASS2, PASS3, and PASS4 refer to passes of the compiler, and not to the 
PASS flight software.</font><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had felt that only PASS1 of the compiler needed to be ported, and 
that emulation or object-code generation could proceed directly from the
 HALMAT intermediate code produced by PASS1.&nbsp; I eventually turned 
out not to be entirely correct in my thinking.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the 
port of PASS1 was <i>completed</i>, apparently successfully, though it wasn't necessarily thoroughly tested. <br>
  </p>



<p><a name="OriginalInstallation"></a>Installation of the PASS1 port goes as follows:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Install git.&nbsp; (How to do that varies by operating system.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Install Python 3.&nbsp; (How to do that varies by operating system.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Install the Python ebcdic module.&nbsp; (Generally "<tt>pip3 install ebcdic</tt>" or else "<tt>pip install ebcdic</tt>".)</li>
  <li>To install the ported HAL/S compiler itself, I'd suggest 
downloading the entire Virtual AGC source tree from our GitHub 
repository.&nbsp; From a command line, 'cd' to whatever directory you'd 
like to install it into, and then do:<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><tt>git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc.git</tt><br>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is lots more than you need just for the HAL/S compiler,
 but it's by far the simplest and fastest way.&nbsp; And easy to update 
later with the command "<tt>git pull</tt>".&nbsp; (GitHub provides a way
 to download just the folder you need, but it takes such an incredibly 
long time that I won't waste your time or mine by describing it.&nbsp; 
Google it if you want.)<br>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Put the folder virtualagc/yaShuttle/ported/PASS1.PROCS/ into your <tt>PATH</tt>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>In Windows only</i>, you may need to make sure the environment variable <tt>PYTHONUTF8=1</tt>
 is set.&nbsp; Otherwise, any characters "¬" or "¢" appearing in your 
source files may not be processed correctly.&nbsp; If you use our 
recommended non-UTF-8 replacements ("~" and "`" respectively) in your 
source code then it won't be a problem, but it's better to be prepared 
for the worst case.<br>
  </li>
</ul>



If you've completed this successfully, then from a command-line prompt 
you should be able to 'cd' into any folder you like and see a meaningful
 response from the command <br>
<blockquote><tt>HAL_S_FC.py --help</tt><br>
</blockquote>
If you do, you're ready to go!&nbsp; <br>


<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; This command-line 
interface to the HAL/S compiler is my own addition rather than a port 
from the original.&nbsp; The IBM System/360 style computers on which the
 original HAL/S compiler ran had no such thing as a command line, and 
therefore no such thing as command-line options.&nbsp; Rather, 
invocation of the compiler, including specification of all of its 
options, was performed by creating a Job Control Language (JCL) file 
containing all of the necessary setup instructions, and of course <i>we</i>
 don't have any modern support for JCL.&nbsp; However, the command-line 
interface supports most of the same options which the JCL did, except 
for some which I haven't figured out well enough yet, plus a few of my 
own devising.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
But there are a <i>lot</i> of options, not all of which can be explained in just a few words, so the <tt>--help</tt>
 command mentioned in the preceding paragraph may turn out to be less 
informative than you may hope ... for example, it tells you that the 
option LFXI is available (vs NOLFXI), but do you want that option or 
not?&nbsp; Well, you won't find out by looking at the <tt>--help</tt> message. In fact, I don't believe there's surviving documentation that describes the <i>complete</i>
 set of compiler options available.&nbsp; If you're interested beyond my
 limited attempt to spoon-feed you this info, my suggestion is to peruse
 <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/HAL_S-FC%20User's%20Manual%20Nov%202005.pdf#page=65">Section 5 ("User-Specified Options") of the 2005 revision of the "HAL/S-FC User's Manual"</a>.&nbsp; However, in the next section, I'll provide my own recommendations as to which compiler options should be used.</font><br>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="OriginalUsage"></a>As far as using the port of the 
compiler's PASS1 is concerned, everything you do with the HAL/S compiler
 is from a command line, so 
everything I talk about below is something you're going to do or see on a
 command 
line.&nbsp; <br>
</p>


<p>Let's suppose you have a folder that contains HAL/S source-code 
files.&nbsp; For example, if you followed the installation instructions 
given above, you'll have downloaded the folder "yaShuttle/Source 
Code/Programming in HAL-S/", which contains ~100 such files.&nbsp; But 
regardless, 'cd' to the folder containing whatever HAL/S source-code 
files you're interested in.<br>
</p>


<p>Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that you have a HAL/S 
source-code file called HELLO.hal.&nbsp; In fact, there is such a file 
in the folder yaShuttle/ported/, though naturally you don't have to use 
it, but let's suppose you do indeed want to 
use it, and that you have cd'd to the yaShuttle/ported/ folder to do 
so.&nbsp; That particular HELLO.hal looks like this:<br>
</p>


<blockquote>
  <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;HELLO: PROGRAM;</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DECLARE I INTEGER;</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DECLARE INTEGER, J;</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REPLACE PRINTER BY "6";</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(PRINTER) 'THE BEGINNING';</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO FOR I = 1 TO 5;</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(PRINTER) I, 'HELLO, WORLD!';</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO FOR J = 2 TO 8 BY 2;</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(¢PRINTER¢) J, 'ISN''T THIS FUN?';</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END;</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END;</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE(6) 'THE END';</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;CLOSE HELLO;</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>How to compile this?&nbsp; Well admittedly, the only up-to-date 
operating system I'm using is Linux.&nbsp; The versions of Windows and 
Mac OS available to me are <i>ancient</i> (Windows 7 and Mac OS 
10.7.5).&nbsp; With that said, I have tried the ported HAL/S
 compiler on the versions I do have, and it works the same on every 
platform.&nbsp; My suggestion is to invoke the HAL/S compiler as 
follows:</p>


<blockquote>
  <pre>HAL_S_FC.py SRN --hal=HELLO<br></pre>
</blockquote>The meaning of the <tt>--hal=HELLO</tt> switch here is pretty obvious, I suppose, and 
it's only necessary to note that if you leave off the suffix ".hal" at 
the end of a source-file name, the compiler will assume it's supposed to
 be there and will add it back.<br>




<p>The option <tt>SRN</tt> tells the compiler to expect that there are 
punch-card sequence numbers in columns 73-80 of the source-code lines 
... which in HELLO.hal of course, there are not!&nbsp; In fact, you could leave off 
this option with no difficulty for this example, or optionally use the 
option <tt>NOSRN</tt> (which is also the default) instead.&nbsp; When <tt>SRN</tt> is present, columns 1-72 are allowed to contain source code, whereas when <tt>NOSRN</tt>
 is present, columns 1-80 contain source code.&nbsp; All of the sample 
source-code files I provide do fit into 72 columns, and all of the 
flight-software source-code files (which I can't presently provide) do 
have card-sequence numbers in columns 73-80, so using the <tt>SRN</tt> 
option works well with any HAL/S files I provide.&nbsp; If you're going to work with
 HAL/S source code, you'd better get used to thinking in terms of a 
limited width, and perhaps to a limited width of 
72 rather than a limited width of 80!<br>

<p>To do anything more-significant with the compiler, you naturally need
 to study the HAL/S language a bit, using the references I recommended 
earlier.&nbsp; But there are a few details that the contemporary HAL/S documentation 
glosses over somewhat, but which you 
need to understand if you're going to work with anything other than a trivially-simple HAL/S program.&nbsp; <br>
</p>First, each HAL/S source-code file comprises a single "compilation 
unit".&nbsp; As far as I can see, there are basically two general 
categories of compilation units.&nbsp; The first type, which is what are
 HELLO.hal example was, has the following stuff in it:<br>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps some comments.</li>
  <li>Perhaps some compiler directives (more on this presently)<br>
  </li>
  <li>A single <tt>PROGRAM</tt> block.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The second type is some mixture of the following stuff:<br>


<ul><li>Perhaps some comments.</li>
<li>Perhaps some compiler directives.</li>
<li><tt>PROCEDURE</tt> blocks.</li>

  <li><tt>FUNCTION</tt> blocks.</li>
  <li><tt>COMPOOL</tt> blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems to have been the custom usually to put a single <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> or a single <tt>FUNCTION</tt> or a single <tt>COMPOOL</tt> in any given compilation unit, but that won't always be the case.<br>
</p>
<p>The <tt>COMPOOL</tt> block needs a little explanation.&nbsp; A <tt>COMPOOL</tt> in HAL/S functions something like a <tt>COMMON</tt>
 area in Fortran or an imported module in Python (except that it 
contains just variables).&nbsp; <tt>COMPOOL</tt>s have names, and there can be many <tt>COMPOOL</tt>s present at once.<br>
</p>


<p>If you played with the "modern" compiler, you'll recall that it was easy to <tt>DECLARE</tt>
 global variables willy-nilly but from the comments I just made above, 
you'll perceive that there's no such thing as a global variable in 
HAL/S.&nbsp; Rather, what you might like to think of as a global 
variable is actually a variable residing in a <tt>COMPOOL</tt>.<br>
</p>
<p>Now, since each <tt>PROCEDURE</tt> and <tt>FUNCTION</tt> usually resides in a
 separate (and separately-compiled) compilation unit, and since every 
variable that's shared between compilation units usually reside in <tt>COMPOOL</tt>s in yet other separate
 compilation units, to compile even a very simple program without errors you have to understand how all of these separate 
compilation units manage to interface to each other.<br>
</p>
<p>The mechanism by which this interface is implemented at the compiler level is based on the 
notion of the "template library".&nbsp; The template library functions 
something like the mechanism of a "header file" in C or C++, in which 
the header file provides prototyping information about functions 
and variables.&nbsp; But rather than 
there being innumerable header files, each specialized to a single 
purpose, HAL/S has a single template library that provides the 
template information for everything.&nbsp; The compiler will read 
the template library whenever a HAL/S source-code file needs it to, but<i> </i>it can also optionally write back to the template library (or some 
separate template library) the information it newly discovers about 
objects it encounters.&nbsp; In that respect, the template library is a simple kind of database.<br>
</p>
<p>The compilation strategy is thus to make sure you compile any 
particular compilation unit <i>before</i> you compile any other 
compilation unit that needs it.&nbsp; (And yes, it's possible to 
have a circular condition in which two different compilation units 
depend on each other, which defeats this strategy.&nbsp; We'll just ignore that in this discussion.)<br>
</p>
<p>So let's take an example.&nbsp; Let's suppose we have a HAL/S <tt>PROGRAM</tt> called <tt>P</tt>, a HAL/S <tt>FUNCTION</tt> called <tt>F</tt> that <tt>P</tt> wants to use, and some "global" variables (<tt>A</tt><tt>0</tt>, <tt>A1</tt>, and <tt>A2</tt>) used by both.&nbsp; Since there's no such thing as a global variable, these latter will have to go into a <tt>COMPOOL</tt> that we'll call <tt>C</tt>.&nbsp; Nominally that's 3 separate compilation units, comprising 3 separate HAL/S source-code files.&nbsp; Perhaps <tt>A</tt><tt>0</tt>, <tt>A1</tt>, and <tt>A2</tt> are the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial and <tt>F()</tt> computes the values of the polynomials. Here's what the source code for these three compilation units might look like:<br>
</p>
<table width="100%" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th valign="top" align="left">C.hal<br>

      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <pre>D INCLUDE TEMPLATE C<br>D INCLUDE TEMPLATE F<br> P: PROGRAM;<br>    A0 = 1.5;<br>    A1 = 5.9;<br>    A2 = -3.3;<br>    DO FOR TEMPORARY I = 1 TO 25;<br>       WRITE(6) I, F(I);<br>    END; <br> CLOSE P;<br></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The <i>first</i> time we process these files, we would have to compile these in left-to-right order, because <tt>COMPOOL C</tt> needs to be in the template library before F.hal is compiled, and <tt>FUNCTION F</tt>
 must be in the template library before P.hal is compiled.&nbsp; (On 
subsequent processing, as long as the prototyping information for <tt>COMPOOL C</tt> and <tt>FUNCTION F</tt> didn't change, the template library wouldn't change, and it wouldn't matter what order we compiled the 3 files.)&nbsp; The 
suggested compiler command-line switches I gave earlier aren't quite 
adequate now that we need to fix up the template library.&nbsp; We need 
two additional switches:&nbsp; <tt>TEMPLATE</tt>, which causes "templates" to be generated for the compilation units encountered, and <tt>--templib</tt>,
 which causes those new templates to be stored in the main template 
library, as opposed to being stored by default in a separate, newly-created temporary template library.&nbsp; So here's what 
the compilation is like:<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>HAL_S_FC.py SRN TEMPLATE --templib -hal=C<br>HAL_S_FC.py SRN TEMPLATE --templib -hal=F<br>HAL_S_FC.py SRN TEMPLATE --templib -hal=P</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For whatever it's worth, the template library is a human-readable 
file (in so-called JSON format), found in the same folder as HAL_S_FC.py
 itself, namely virtualagc/yaShuttle/ported/TEMPLIB.json.&nbsp; (No, in case you're bothered by such things, JSON did 
not exist when the original HAL/S compiler was written. But I use JSON 
to implement something the IBM operating system called a Partitioned 
Data Set, or PDS for short.&nbsp; The fact that it's JSON rather than 
PDS is at the operating-system level and is transparent to the 
HAL/S compiler proper.)&nbsp; So can you actually see what the generated templates 
look
 like just by looking at TEMPLIB.json:<br>
</p>

Hopefully this emphasizes a point that may not have been entirely 
obvious before, which is that the template library merely contains 
meta-information about the compilation units it has processed, but does <i>not</i>
 contain the compiled object code for those units!&nbsp; The object code
 for each unit is separate, and must be combined into a single executable by a
 linker program ... which we do not have at present.<br>
<br>
Another thing you may notice that's important to know from time to time is that the 
identifying names of the templates appearing in the template library are
 <i>not</i> the actual names of the compilation units as they appeared in the original HAL/S source code.&nbsp; So instead of names like <tt>C</tt>, <tt>F</tt>, and <tt>P</tt>, we see identifying names like "<tt>@@C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>", "<tt>@@F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>", and "<tt>@@P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>".&nbsp; The compiler produces these names by:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Removing any underline characters.</li>
  <li>Adding the prefix "<tt>@@</tt>".</li>
  <li>Truncating to 8 characters if necessary.</li>
  <li>Padding with blanks if less than 8 characters long.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><b>Warning:</b> The side effect of this is that if you had, say, a <tt>FUNCTION</tt> called <tt>VELOCITY_OF_EARTH</tt> and another called <tt>VELOCITY_OF_SHIP</tt>, <i>both</i> of them would result in generation of a template called "<tt>@@VELOCI</tt>".&nbsp;

 But there can be only one.&nbsp;
 The template for whichever was compiled most-recently would overwrite 
the other's template in the template library, without any warning you'd 
be likely to notice, probably eventually 
causing a compile time error when some hapless compilation unit tried to
 use the now-overwritten function template.&nbsp; (If you recognized the
 "there can be only one" reference a couple of sentences back, you might
 say that this is high-handed behavior on the part of HAL/S-FC, or even 
than HAL/S-FC was a Highhander.&nbsp; Then again, you might not.)&nbsp; 
This behavior is related to the limitations of the IBM 360 file-system 
objects known as Partitioned Data Sets, rather than just being some 
random idiocy; it is analogous to the 8-character filenames (plus 
3-character "extensions") that those of us old enough to experience 
Microsoft DOS (and Digital Research CP/M) had to endure.&nbsp; It didn't
 seem so bad at the time.</font><br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Why was this the port of PASS1 
abandoned?&nbsp; It turned out that additional data concerning the 
flight software had become available in the meantime, about which I 
don't yet care to speak, and it became obvious PASS1 was not 
enough.&nbsp; To make full use of the additional data would require 
ports of <i>at least</i> the OPT, AUX, and PASS passes.&nbsp; But the 
effort and cost in time of porting just PASS1 had been so great that I 
couldn't really tolerate the thought of proceeding to port at least 
three additional passes.&nbsp; Almost as significant is the fact that <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/HAL_S-360%20Compiler%20System%20Specification%204%20Feb%201977.pdf">the documentation for HALMAT had survived only in incomplete form</a>.&nbsp; HALMAT itself is version-dependent to some degree, and the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/HALMAT%20-%20An%20Intermediate%20Language.pdf">more-complete but early documentation</a>
 we have of it is seldom relevant to the compiler source-code version 
available to us.&nbsp; As porting of the compiler's PASS1 progressed, I 
became increasingly-less optimistic that adequate HALMAT documentation 
could be recovered to use it as the basis for emulation or code 
generation.&nbsp; But since the port of PASS1 can (or should be able to)
 produce reports and HALMAT output identical to the original HAL/S-FC, 
it remains valuable as a cross-checking tool, even if abandoned for 
primary HAL/S development.</font><br>
