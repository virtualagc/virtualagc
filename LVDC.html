    Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) was a computer that resided in the
    Instrument Unit (IU) that perched above the Saturn IVB that was the
    second stage in a Saturn IB rocket and the third stage in a Saturn V
    rocket.&nbsp; The LVDC was a completely separate computer system
    from the AGC, with a different architecture, different
    instruction-set, and different runtime software.&nbsp; The purpose
    of the LVDC was to precisely control the Saturn from shortly before
    liftoff until the point at which the Saturn was discarded by the
    CSM.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <table summary="" style="text-align: left; width: 60%; margin-left:

            </div>
            People generally think that the guidance computer (AGC) of
            the command module controlled the Saturn rocket, but it
            isn't true.&nbsp; During certain burns, it <span
              style="font-style: italic;">was</span> possible for the
            CSM's AGC to control the steering, as a backup to the
            LVDC.&nbsp; That backup capability was never used in a
            mission.&nbsp; <a href="#Interaction_with_the_AGC">More on
              this below</a>.<br>

        src="LVDCandFriend.jpg" width="443" height="377"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    The LVDC has a less-visible role in people's eyes than the AGC, not
    only because it was used for only a very small portion of the
    individual missions, but also because it had no user interface as
    such.&nbsp; And frankly, because it plays no role at all in the
    movie <i>Apollo 13</i>.&nbsp; In essence, it was a black box that
    responded to inputs from sensors in the Saturn and to ground
    telemetry, but there was no panel into which astronauts could enter
    commands or get feedback from it.&nbsp; One might well call the LVDC
    "The Forgotten Computer", even more so that the computer of the <a
      href="yaAGS.html">LM's Abort Guidance System</a>.&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, the LVDC's importance is great, because you need to
    actually get the Command Module and Lunar Module into space and
    headed toward the moon if you expect any landings to occur!&nbsp; As
    I understand it, the folks that actually worked on the Saturn
    referred to the Instrument Unit as "The Brain", and that term might
    as well be applied to the LVDC, since it was the brain of The Brain.<br>

    The LVDC was developed by IBM Federal Systems Division, rather than
    by the MIT Instrumentation Lab that developed the AGC, so there was
    no overlap in development personnel between the LVDC and AGC
    systems.&nbsp; Furthermore, there was almost no overlap in
    engineering technique, other than that both groups of necessity were
    generally constrained by the technology available at the time.&nbsp;
    For example, both needed to use memory based on ferrite-core
    technology.&nbsp; Moreover, there was no interaction between the
    LVDC and AGC systems.<br>
    <br>
    Actually, there was <i>some</i> interaction between the development
    groups, in the sense that at some point in 1963 or before the idea
    arose that the LVDC might be used in place of the AGC in the CM and
    LM, and that this move might save some time and money.&nbsp; In
    fact, IBM produced a 300+ page report detailing the differences
    between the two systems with the apparent object of arguing this
    point, and the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory's antibodies flooded
    in to destroy the invader with critiques and reports negative of the
    IBM report.&nbsp; In the end, the Instrumentation Lab won this
    particular battle, relegating the LVDC to the relatively small share
    of public attention that it presently enjoys.<br>

      Devices</h2>
    As with any of the other computer systems we cover here at Virtual
    AGC, the LVDC does not stand alone and do its computing in a
    computing vacuum (so to speak).&nbsp; The subsystems involved are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA) interfaced the LVDC's
        digital signals to the analog world of the Instrument Unit's
        sensors.&nbsp; Actually, the LVDA is so closely coupled to the
        LVDC that it may make more sense to consider them as forming a
        single unit, though packaged separately.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The ST-124-M Inertial Platform Assembly—catchy name!—was an
        inertial measuring unit that supplied the LVDC with information
        about the rocket's orientation and acceleration.&nbsp; It had 3
        integrating accelerometers that measured acceleration with
        respect to the stable (space-fixed as opposed to rocket-fixed)
        platform, as well as angular sensors to measure the orientation
        of the stable platform with respect to the rocket.&nbsp; Like
        the AGC IMU, it was a 3-gimbal system and therefore
        theoretically subject to "gimbal lock", but because the range of
        motion of the rocket during the burn phase, I suppose that
        avoidance of gimbal lock must have been somewhat easier than in
        the CM or LM.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The "Control Computer" or "Flight Control Computer" was an
        analog computer that translated attitude-correction commands,
        angular change, and vehicle lateral acceleration information
        into propulsion-system thruster nozzle and/or engine actuator
        positioning commands.&nbsp; As such, it is of little interest in
        simulation of the LVDC (which is our primary concern at Virtual
        AGC).&nbsp;&nbsp; If the naming of this device seems odd, note
        that it follows the general convention of the word "control"
        being defined to mean the execution of an action that has been
        decided upon elsewhere, and not the act of decision-making.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The Control-EDS Rate Gyros.</li>
      <li>The Control Accelerometers (Saturn IB only).</li>
      <li>The propulsion engine actuators.</li>
      <li>The auxiliary propulsion system.&nbsp; This was a set of 6
        nozzles mounted on the aft end of the S-IVB stage which were
        used to provide attitude control in coasting (non-burn)
        periods.&nbsp; I believe that it may also have provided roll
        control during the S-IVB turn during boost.&nbsp; (The engines
        of the S-IC and S-II stages could provide complete
        pitch/yaw/roll control, but the engine of the S-IVB state could
        only control pitch and yaw, and therefore needed to be
        supplemented to provide control of roll.)&nbsp; The auxiliary
        propulsion system was directly controlled by the Flight Control
        Computer, but the Flight Control Computer was commanded by the
        LVDC.</li>
      <li>Telemetry downlink.</li>
      <li>Command uplink.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    At the end of the preceding section was an illustration of a very
    simplified logical view of the interconnection of the LVDC to
    various peripherals.&nbsp; Here is a somewhat more complete
    illustration for the Saturn IB:<br>

            <p>Let's talk about how the launch vehicle could interact
              with the Command Module's AGC before immersing ourselves
              in too much detail about the LVDC specifically.&nbsp; I
              may perhaps go into this topic in more detail than suits
              your taste, so feel free to ignore this section
              entirely!&nbsp; I can just give you the executive
              summary:&nbsp; There was <i>very little</i> interaction
              between the AGC and the Saturn rocket under normal
              circumstances.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <p>I talk about this a lot primarily because it has
              sometimes been at the center of spirited arguments for
              which I have not necessarily always had all the relevant
              facts immediately at my fingertips.&nbsp; (Thanks,
              Fabrizio Bernardini.)&nbsp; Well, ... now I will have
              those facts lined up when I need them, and so will you.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For the sake of clarity, I've taken the Saturn V block
              diagram from the preceding section, chopped out everything
              except the Instrument Unit (IU), and added a bit of
              coloring to the connections between the IU and the CSM
              ("SPACECRAFT"):<br>

              vehicle (i.e., the Saturn V or IB rocket) was always <i>directly</i>
              steered by the so-called Flight Control Computer (or FCC,
              depicted in the picture at the right), an analog computer
              whose salient property for our purposes is that it was <i>not</i>
              the LVDC.&nbsp; However, the FCC did not operate on its
              own, and thus itself needed to be supervised.&nbsp;
              Normally, that supervision was performed, by default, by
              the LVDC, indirectly through the LVDA, the Launch Vehicle
              Data Adapter. <br>
            </p>
            <p>However, it was also possible for the Command Module to
              send the flight control computer a signal, the Mode
              Command, which instructed it to accept Alternate Steering
              Commands from the AGC rather than the default steering

                  would have</font><font size="-1"> presided over the
                  process.&nbsp; Normally P11 would just have been used
                  to monitor the launch vehicle's activity.&nbsp; But if
                  a toggle switch called "LV Guidance" on the CM's
                  control panel (seen to the left) were to be flipped
                  into the position marked "CMC",&nbsp; P11 could detect
                  this via one of the AGC's i/o channels, namely bit 10
                  of channel 30.&nbsp; In turn, P11 could set bit 9 of
                  i/o channel 12:&nbsp; That's the "Mode Command" signal
                  in the block diagram above, and it's what told the IU
                  that the change of control was taking place.&nbsp; At
                  the same time, P11 would begin sending the "Alternate
                  Steering Commands" to the IU, and those are what
                  performed the actual steering.&nbsp; As it happens,
                  these Alternate Steering Commands were no different
                  than the ones used by the AGC's digital autopilot to
                  steer the CM itself:&nbsp; They were literally the
                  same electrical wires up to the point where they
                  separated to go off to the IU, though controlled
                  within the Colossus software by different
                  polynomial-based flight equations.&nbsp; It's
                  important to recognize that these signals were analog
                  in nature, not digital.&nbsp; Or to put it in other
                  words, the AGC did <i>not</i> control the LVDC.&nbsp;
                  The LVDC was simply completely out of the picture
                  insofar as steering was concerned, once the Mode
                  Command to switch control to the CMC had arrived in
                  the IU.&nbsp; It was also possible during P11 to key

            <p>Could the AGC exercise this control over the launch
              vehicle in <i>all</i> Apollo missions?&nbsp; Regarding
              Apollo 7, there is presently no information
              whatever.&nbsp; But for the remaining missions, No!&nbsp;
              The ability for P11 to provide automatic steering <i>wasn't</i>
              present in 8 or 9, though it was present in Apollo 10 and
              beyond.&nbsp; On the other hand, manual steering via the
              Rotational Hand Controller (RHC) was available in Apollo 8
              and onward.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is not enough
              surviving documentation presently to have full certainty
              about all of the details.<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; I draw my
                conclusions from examination of the Colossus source
                code.&nbsp; First consider automatic steering.&nbsp;
                Insofar as Apollo 8 (Colossus 237) and 9 (Colossus 249)
                are concerned, they did not read bit 10 of i/o channel
                30, and therefore could not have known to initiate
                automatic control.&nbsp; On the other hand, that
                capability is present in Apollo 10 (a version of
                Colossus called MANCHE45R2) onward.&nbsp; Admittedly, I
                have no basis for the assumption that the steering
                capability was 100% implemented and operational at that
                juncture.&nbsp; Nor do I have any information as to
                whether that steering ability was present for every <i>stage</i>
                of the rocket, or whether it merely applied to the S-IVB
                stage.<br>
                <br>
                Regarding manual steering via the RHC, every version of
                Colossus from Apollo 8 onward has the following verbatim
                comment in P11's source code:&nbsp; "SATURN TAKEOVER
                FUNCTION ... DURING THE COASTING PHASE OF SIVB ATTACHED,
                THE ASTRONAUT MAY REQUEST SATURN TAKEOVER THROUGH
                EXTENDED VERB 46 (BITS 13,14 OF DAPDATR1 SET). THE CMC
                REGARDS RHC COMMANDS AS BODY-AXES RATE COMMANDS AND IT
                TRANSMITS THESE TO SATURN AS DC VOLTAGES. THE VALUE OF
                THE CONSTANT RATE COMMAND </font><font size="-1">IS 0.5
                DEG/SEC. AN ABSENCE OF RHC ACTIVITY RESULTS IN A ZERO
                RATE COMMAND. THE FDAI ERROR NEEDLES WILL INDICATE THE
                VALUE OF THE RATE COMMAND."&nbsp; This seems pretty
                conclusive, though it only applies to the "coasting
                phase", at which point stages S-IC and S-II would have
                been ejected, so at least on the face of it seems to
                apply only the S-IVB stage.</font><br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Of course, it was also desirable for the CM to be able to
              monitor the activity of the Saturn, even under normal
              conditions when the LVDC was controlling the rocket.&nbsp;
              Since the spacecraft had its own Inertial Measurement Unit
              (IMU), it knew its own orientation and acceleration — and
              hence the Saturn's orientation and acceleration — at all
              times, and the AGC could mathematically integrate these
              quantities to know the velocity and position at all
              times.&nbsp; Thus it was not necessary for the IU to
              communicate that information to the spacecraft in order
              for the AGC to monitor the physical motion of the rocket
              and to display it for the astronauts on the DSKY.&nbsp;
              Which is why there are <i>no</i> signals in the block
              diagram showing such state-vector data flowing back from
              the IU to the AGC. <br>

                the IU, so perhaps there's some additional magic going

                Regarding the IU's Status signals, those would appear to
                be "LIFTOFF" and "ULLAGE", which are presumably bits 5
                and 1 of the CMC's i/o channel 30.&nbsp; The only one of

              physical system.&nbsp; Rather, Riley Rainey has used the

              Instrumentation Unit (IU) was <i>supposed</i> to behave,
              to model the physical behavior of the rocket and the
              spacecraft's IMU, allowing Virtual AGC to monitor the
              launch behavior on a simulated DSKY.&nbsp; Here's a short
              movie he has created of that simulation.&nbsp; It's
              admittedly a little fuzzy, since I blew it up by about 2×,
              but perhaps we'll be able to get a better one sometime in
              the future:</p>

            on.&nbsp; That's apparently because Riley's simulated DSKY
            (which is his own, and not the simulated DSKY we provide)
            isn't fully functional in the sense of accepting keypad
            input, so Riley is instead feeding the AGC commands via the
            digital uplink.<br>

    <h2><a name="LVDC_Software"></a>LVDC Software</h2>
    <h3><a name="Overall_Structure"></a>Overall Structure</h3>
    <p>Describing the overall structure of the software loaded into the
      LVDC is a bit tricky at the present time.&nbsp; That's because
      documentation is scarce, our cache of original LVDC software is
      sparse, and the original development process seemed quite
      compartmentalized.&nbsp; By the latter, I mean that programmers
      concentrated on the specific areas to which they were assigned,
      and often seem to have had little cognizance of even the most
      basic features of the software when those features happened to be
      outside their narrow specialization.&nbsp; Plus the set of LVDC
      programmers available to me is limited, so I don't have
      representatives of all of those specializations to consult
      with.&nbsp; Of course, it's also possible that the many decades
      between the time they spent working on the project and the time I
      was able to quiz them about it may also have acted to erase some
      of the information.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In short, important aspects of my descriptions in these sections
      concerning the gross structure of&nbsp; the software are based on
      my own inferences and on the recollections of developers not
      entirely familiar with the details.&nbsp; So take my comments
      about the program structure with a large grain of salt.&nbsp; Of
      course, as more LVDC code has dribbled in over the years, more of
      it has become susceptible to reverse engineering as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With that said, let's contrast the overall structure of the LVDC
      code vs the software source code for the Apollo Guidance Computer
      (the programs <a href="Colossus.html">COLOSSUS</a>, <a
        href="Luminary.html">LUMINARY</a>, and so on) and for the <a
        href="yaAGS.html">Abort Guidance System</a>.&nbsp; All of these
      non-LVDC programs were <i>monolithic</i> in nature.&nbsp; What I
      mean by that is that although the AGC and AGS software was
      structured into various semi-independent sections, for which the
      development of each was presided over by specialists in those
      specific areas, the source code for them was nevertheless
      presented to the programmers in a single large chunk — i.e., a
      single, unified program listing.&nbsp; Every AGC or AGS developer
      saw the entire source code, regardless of whether it pertained to
      them or not.&nbsp; The natural result was that it was possible
      (and even likely) for an AGC or AGS developer to have some grasp
      of the large-scale structure of the software, beyond his or her
      own narrow area of specialization.&nbsp; Similarly, every word
      stored in the AGC or AGS core memory came from that source
      code.&nbsp; In that sense, each AGC or AGS program listing was
      entirely self-contained.&nbsp; If you were able to assemble those
      program listings, then you obtained a rope image that could be
      loaded into the computer and run.&nbsp; Conversely, every word in
      core-memory either came directly from the associated program
      listing or from some action taken by the code in that program
      listing.&nbsp; When you look at an ABC program listing for (say)
      LUMINARY, you see the <i>entire</i> contents of the Lunar
      Module's AGC's core memory.&nbsp; Moreover, almost all of the AGC
      executable code was stored in read-only memory, and thus the AGC
      programs contained no self-modifying code; once again, what you
      saw in the program listings was what you got!&nbsp; (An exception
      could be the relatively-tiny amount of Erasable Memory Programs,
      or EMPs.&nbsp; Since these were loaded separately and were in
      read-write memory, they were not shown in the main program listing
      and could in theory be self-modifying.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>The overall structure of the LVDC software, however, is
      fundamentally different.&nbsp; For one thing, the entire memory of
      the LVDC was read-write, and thus software could be and <i>was</i>
      sometimes self-modifying during operation.&nbsp; Moreover,
      simultaneously loaded into the LVDC core memory were <i>several</i>
      different logically-distinct "programs", each with <i>different</i>
      sets of source code, assembled <i>separately</i> from each other,
      and having different areas of specialization.&nbsp; Thus assembly
      of any given one of these programs did not produce a full
      core-rope image: merely a partial rope image.&nbsp; A full rope
      image could be obtained only by merging all of the partial
      core-rope images from the different assemblies of the several sets
      of source code.&nbsp; The separate programs I'm aware of are
      discussed individually in the sections that follow, but in brief,
      they were:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Preflight Program</li>
      <li>The Flight Program<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A similar situation arises in modern computer systems, where you
      typically have an "operating system" program and "application
      programs" running in the computer at the same time.&nbsp; The
      application programs rely on the operating system for certain
      functionality, but have no understanding of how the operating
      system provides that functionality.&nbsp; All the application
      program needs to know is the exact method for requesting the
      desired function from the operating system.&nbsp; Similarly, the
      operation system stands ready to provide the desired
      functionality, but has no knowledge of the internal workings of
      the application program requesting service.&nbsp; The model of a
      "BIOS" and software running atop the BIOS is even more <i>á
        propos</i>, though that may be a concept no longer meaningful
      enough to most computer programmers to be very illustrative.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the LVDC, the method by which interaction between independent
      but simultaneously-loaded programs worked was for there to be an
      agreed-upon set of specific memory addresses hard coded into the
      programs.&nbsp; For example, one program would know that to obtain
      a certain type of service, it had to call a routine at a certain
      fixed address in memory.&nbsp; Another program would know that it
      had to put code providing certain types of services at certain
      fixed addresses, but have no other knowledge of the program(s)
      utilizing that functionality.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Because of this much higher degree of compartmentalization,
      programmers working on (say) the Flight Program might have no
      cognizance at all of the Preflight Program, the developers of
      which might have no cognizance of the Flight Program.&nbsp; And
      unfortunately, that means that <i>we</i> don't have a lot of
      understanding of it either.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With all of that said, later Flight Programs like AS-512 and
      AS-513 appear to have much less reliance on the Preflight Program,
      to the extent that they may be able to operate with essentially a
      skeleton version of the Preflight Program.&nbsp; While this claim
      hasn't yet been fully analyzed as of this writing, it appears as
      though the only parts of the Preflight Program desired by the
      Flight Program may be:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot code.&nbsp; The LVDC begins execution upon power-up at
        address 0-00-0-000, which has no defined contents in the Flight
        Program source code, and hence is presumably part of the
        Preflight Program.&nbsp; The Preflight Program must therefore
        have at least enough code at that address to set the Flight
        Program's operating mode and to transfer control to the Flight
        Program's entry point.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Built-in self-test.&nbsp; The Flight Program has no built-in
        self-test of its own, and consequently relies on self-test
        results presumably computed by the Preflight Program.</li>
      <li>Digital Command System (DCS).&nbsp; DCS is the system whereby
        ground control could remotely send digital commands to the
        LVDC.&nbsp; I think that the Preflight Program is what receives
        these commands, and either acts upon them itself or distributes
        them to the Flight Program, as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Consequently, for some purposes, a skeleton Preflight Program
      could consist essentially of nothing but boot code.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Preflight_Program"></a>Preflight Program</h3>
    <p>Until recently (as I write this), little about the Preflight
      Program has been known.&nbsp; Just from inspection of the
      available LVDC Flight Program source code, some inferences were
      possible.&nbsp; For example:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the AS-206RAM Flight Program (1967), there are jumps to
        various memory locations in regions of core memory at which
        AS-206RAM itself does not define any code or variables.&nbsp; It
        stands to reason that <i>something</i> is stored there.&nbsp; <a
          href="#Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software">This is discussed in
          more detail below</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>One of the original LVDC software developers (thanks, Pat
        Woods!) has told me that he believes that the Flight Program
        shared memory with a Preflight Program that ran before liftoff.</li>
      <li>Similarly, the AS-512 and AS-513 Flight Programs have a couple
        of modules — namely, PREFLIGHT DCS LINKAGE and PREFLIGHT G &amp;
        C STEERING — whose sole purpose is linking the Flight Program to
        the Preflight Program.</li>
    </ol>
    Fortunately, some quite-significant documentation has become
    available, in the form of a document called the "<a
      moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="Documents/lvdc_preflight_program_descriptions.pdf">LVDC
      Preflight Program Descriptions</a>" for the AS-512 (Apollo 17),
    AS-513 (Skylab 1), and AS-206 (Skylab 2) missions.&nbsp; This
    document is similar to the Equations Defining Document (EDD) for the
    LVDC Flight Program, in that it includes somewhat-detailed
    theory-of-operation descriptions of the various subroutines of the
    Preflight Program, as well as software flowcharts for those
    subroutines. <br>
    <br>
    I don't propose to dissect this document for you, but you can read
    it yourself if you're interested.&nbsp; In addition to that
    document, our document library also contains several revisions of
    the "Saturn Preflight Program Verification Plan", which you may find
    provide additional helpful information.&nbsp; See also the "<a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="#PreflightFlowcharts">Preflight
      Program Flowcharts</a>" section below.<br>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <h3><a name="Flight_Program_in_General"></a>Flight Program</h3>
    <p>The software was apparently known simply as the Flight Program,
      and didn't have a catchy name such as "Luminary" or "Colossus".<br>
    </p>
    <p>You may also see references to the Generalized Flight Program
      (GFP) or generalized Flight Program System, in use from Apollo 12
      onward. At that point the flight program was restructured for
      easier maintenance on a mission-by-mission basic, and that's where
      the "generalized" comes from.</p>
    Was the Flight Program classified in a national-security
    sense?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Or at least it was not classified at the time
    period from which we begin to have any information.&nbsp; Several
    people associated with the development have stated to me that it was
    classified.&nbsp; But classified material must be stamped with one
    of the designations <tt>CONFIDENTIAL</tt>, <tt>SECRET</tt>, or <tt>TOP


























      SECRET</tt>, not to mention having strict controls on
    availability.&nbsp; In other words, if this software was classified,
    it's highly unlikely we would have any access to it via parties who
    simply walked off it it ... current behavior by well-known national
    figures suggesting otherwise notwithstanding.&nbsp; Moreover, the
    available software listings are not so stamped, and therefore should
    not be considered classified.&nbsp; Undoubtedly IBM Federal Systems
    Division considered it "confidential" at the time, in the sense that
    like every other organization they reflexively wanted to hide it for
    their own private corporate reasons, but that doesn't make it
    classified in the sense of national security.<br>

            flown lunar-landing mission of Apollo.<br>
            <br>
            As far as we can tell, this is the complete Flight Program
            used in the actual mission.&nbsp; Lacking the associated
            Preflight Program, though, it still leaves us a bit short of
            having the full set of LVDC software for the mission, though
            perhaps only <i>barely</i> short.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, the creators of the original LVDC compiler
            didn't see fit to include such niceties on their printouts
            as the date or code version, or at least not in any way we
            can unambiguously decipher it now, nor did the writers of
            the code see fit include such information (or even the
            Apollo mission number) within the code.&nbsp; In other
            words, the printout itself doesn't actually provide much
            direct support for the claim that this code was flown on
            Apollo 17, or indeed anywhere at all.&nbsp; And alas, the
            surviving owners of the printout appear to have had no
            knowledge at all of the nature of the material in their
            possession, with the original owner unfortunately being
            deceased by the time we became aware of the printout.&nbsp;
            <i>We</i> believe this code was flown on Apollo 17 partially
            because of the handwritten markings on the printout, which
            you can see in the photo to the right ... made at some
            unknown time by some unknown person.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

            As it happens, there is a somewhat-cryptic notation in the
            assembler's messages which could be relevant, if we assume
            that "FT-512-1" stands for "Flight Program AS-512":<br>

                Besides which, I'm told that the assembly listing does
                include various presettings which are consistent with
                Apollo 17.&nbsp; For example, on p. 31 of the listing we
                find that something called <tt>P.DATE</tt> was set to

          <td valign="middle">Skylab 1 (AS-513) was the mission that
            launched Skylab into orbit.&nbsp; It was an unmanned
            mission, succeeded almost immediately by the manned Skylab 2
            mission, and then later by the manned Skylab 3 and 4
            missions.&nbsp; As you may recall, Skylab itself was based
            upon a modified Saturn S-IVB stage, without the usual
            propulsion provided by that stage, but <i>with</i> the
            S-IVB's Instrumentation Unit (IU) containing the LVDC and
            controlling the other stages of the rocket.&nbsp; Thus the
            launch was essentially a normal Saturn V launch, but with a
            modified third stage.<br>
            <br>
            As far as we can tell, this is the complete Flight Program,
            though whether it was actually flown on the mission or is
            instead some earlier revision of the code we can't say <i>for


















































              sure</i> ... but we think it was.&nbsp; Of course, lacking
            the matching Preflight Program, it does not by itself
            provide the full LVDC software for the mission in either
            case, but even if not, it almost does so.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            As far as our claim that this code was associated with the
            Skylab 1 mission is concerned, the evidence consists
            partially of the handwritten notation seen in the photo
            below of the physical printout.&nbsp; Next to it, you see
            also a similar notation on the AS-512 printout, which was
            received from the same owners at the same time, so we're
            entitled to have roughly the same level of trust in the
            handwritten notation for AS-513 as we do for AS-512.<br>

                  the name of a heroic aerospace engineer in a
                  "thriller" novel.&nbsp; I think.&nbsp; (But feel free
                  to use it, if you're writing one!)<br>
                  <br>
                  The acronym OAT appears in the various Launch Vehicle
                  Flight Evaluation Reports, and specifically the one
                  for Skylab 3 whose link(s) are to the left.&nbsp; OAT
                  stands for Overall Test.&nbsp; For example, the Skylab
                  3 report specifically gives a timeline that includes
                  "Malfunction Overall Test (OAT)" on June
                  19,1973.&nbsp; I actually find three types of OAT
                  listed in that (and other) documentation, namely
                  "Space Vehicle OAT No. 1 (Plugs In)", "Launch Vehicle
                  Swing Arm OAT", and "Malfunction OAT".&nbsp; So I
                  think it's reasonable to suppose that a "SIM FLT MAL
                  OAT" would be a "simulated-flight malfunction overall
                  test", or some variation thereof.&nbsp; In other
                  words, our report would be a MAL OAT using simulated
                  flight data, performed prior to the actual MAL OAT
                  using the physical Saturn IB.<br>

                </div>
                <div class="moz-cite-prefix">The MAL OAT itself appears
                  to be simply a timestamped log of all the
                  launch-vehicle events that the OAT was capable of
                  detecting, and those events appear to be the ON/OFF
                  states of various signal wires.&nbsp; The exact
                  interpretations are open to question, as I've not yet
                  found any specific documentation as to how to read MAL
                  OAT tests.&nbsp; Each event is marked with a
                  designation like "DDA", "DEE", "LDO", "LDI", "MDO", or
                  "MDI".&nbsp; "DDA" <i>may</i> stand for "Digital Data
                  Acquisition"; the Saturn Flight Manual explains, among
                  other things, that<br>
                  <blockquote><font size="-1">Telemetry system GP1 is a
                      PCM/DDAS link that transmits realtime checkout
                      data before launch, and measuring program
                      information during flight.</font><br>
                  </blockquote>
                  Which sound promising, if hardly definitive.&nbsp;
                  Similarly, "DEE" <i>may</i> stand for "Digital Events
                  Evaluator":<br>
                  <blockquote><font size="-1">The digital event
                      evaluators (DEE) are used to monitor the status of
                      input lines and generate a time tagged printout
                      for each detected change in input status.</font><br>
                  </blockquote>
                  As for "LDO" <i>et al</i>, you might suppose that a
                  trailing "I" refers to input while a trailing "O"
                  refers to output.&nbsp; Of course, what's an "input"
                  vs what's an "output" would depend on your point of
                  view:&nbsp; An "output" from the LVDC is an "input" to
                  the device receiving the signal from the LVDC.&nbsp;
                  So the most we could infer from this is that "I" and
                  "O" signals may be going in opposite directions.&nbsp;
                  For example, given a sequence of notations from the
                  bottom of p. 1 of the report like<br>
                  <blockquote><tt>...</tt><tt><br>

              <div align="left"><i>perhaps</i> one could infer that the

                forth.&nbsp; Or perhaps not.<br>
                <br>
                At any rate, the reason I'm droning on about this report
                is that if the report really is a log of such events,
                and if the report could be interpreted properly, then it
                could perhaps also give us a reasonable timeline of the
                activities the LVDC was performing; i.e., which of its
                outputs it was controlling and which of its inputs it
                was interrogating.&nbsp; That could be useful in
                assessing simulated runs of other LVDC software
                versions.<br>

            With that said, don't assume too much similarity between the
            Skylab 1 mission (for which we have the software) and the
            Skylab 3 mission (for which we don't).&nbsp; Skylab 1 used a
            modified Saturn V launch vehicle, whereas Skylab 3 used a
            Saturn IB launch vehicle, so the LVDC software must have
            been configured pretty differently between those two
            missions.<br>

      Program<br>
    </h3>
    <blockquote> <font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; You may wonder why
        there's an extensive write-up here of the unflown AS-206RAM
        Flight Program, whereas there is little to-do made of seemingly
        more-importation flight programs like the one for AS-512 (Apollo
        17).&nbsp; (And similarly for the PTC software write-up in the
        next section.)&nbsp; But it's not some kind of snarky comment on
        the relative significance of AS-206RAM vs AS-512.&nbsp; It's
        just that when this write-up was done, AS-206RAM was the <i>only</i>
        LVDC code known to exist.&nbsp; And naturally, finding it was
        therefore a very big deal and I made a big fuss over it!&nbsp; A
        lot of the description below would be relevant to other versions
        of the Flight Program as well.</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    To a computer programmer, the most important thing about any
    computer program is its source code, and at present not many
    versions of the LVDC Flight Program are available to us.&nbsp; (For
    some non-flight LVDC software, see the PAST program described in <a
      href="#PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program">the next section</a>.)&nbsp;
    The Flight Program at issue in this section is an engineering
    revision of the software, from September 1967, designated "AS-206RAM
    LVDC FLIGHT PROGRAM".&nbsp; If you were to Google this (<b>don't do
      it!</b>), you may confuse yourself by noting that Saturn IB launch
    vehicle AS-206 was used for the Skylab 2 mission
    (Conrad/Weitz/Kerwin).&nbsp; But the Skylab 2 mission was in 1973,
    far past the 1967 time frame in which this revision of the program
    is developed.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; The answer, is that AS-206 was
    <i>originally</i> intended for an unmanned mission that was canceled
    after the Apollo 1 fire.&nbsp; The software we have is not even for
    that canceled early AS-206 mission, but rather for a proposed backup
    to the canceled mission.&nbsp; So whatever software the LVDC had
    when AS-206 eventually launched as Skylab 2, is not <i>this</i>
    software.&nbsp; That doesn't alter the fact that this software is
    ancestral to the versions that followed it ... or at least a very
    close cousin to the ancestor of the versions following it.&nbsp;
    There are some references in the software to AS-205, which is what
    would have been Apollo 2 (the 2nd manned Apollo mission) had the
    tragic Apollo 1 fire not occurred; naturally, Apollo 2 was canceled
    thereafter.&nbsp; The designation AS-205 was <i>later</i> used
    instead for Apollo 7, though considering the time-frames involved,
    it's likely that the reference in the source code is to Apollo 2
    rather than Apollo 7.&nbsp; In other words, the our AS-206RAM flight
    program had likely been branched off from the LVDC software being
    developed for the never-flown Apollo 2 mission.<br>
    <br>
    As mentioned earlier, we believe that there would have been a
    separate Preflight Program (which we know essentially nothing about)
    interacting with the Flight Program through shared memory.&nbsp;
    Thus the AS-206RAM Flight Program we have does <i>not</i>
    completely describe the contents of LVDC core memory, and thus is
    not a complete LVDC program as it stands.&nbsp; More on this below.<br>
    <br>
    As far as an AS-206RAM mission specifically is concerned, "RAM"
    stands for Restart Alternate Mission.&nbsp; We have the document "<a
      href="Documents/19680007324.pdf">AS-206 S-IVB RESTART ALTERNATE
      MISSION LAUNCH VEHICLE OPERATIONAL FLIGHT TRAJECTORY</a>", which I
    expect would be pretty invaluable in understanding the expected
    operation of the flight program.&nbsp; To quote the document itself,<br>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <blockquote><small>The basic purpose of the Apollo Saturn 206 S-IVB
        Restart Alternate Mission is to place the S-IVB stage into orbit
        and test its restart capability, simulating the AS-501 mission
        profile. In the event S-IVB restart problems occur in the early
        Saturn V flights, this mission will be flown to help correct or
        solve the problems. The primary objective of the SA-206 Launch
        Vehicle is to insert the S-IVB/IU/Payload configuration into a
        near earth 100 nautical mile circular orbit. The payload
        consists of a Spacecraft LM Adapter (SLA) and a 25° Nose Cone
        (NC #2).</small><br>
    </blockquote>
    As usual in these matters, what <i>we</i> have is not the punch
    cards on which the assembly-language source code was originally
    provided to the assembler program, but rather the "assembly listing"
    output by the assembler.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the status of the
    original assembly process for it found 41 warnings and 7 errors —
    meaning that there were problems in the source code and that the
    assembly process <i>failed</i>.&nbsp; Thus our listing represents
    an uncompleted development version that wouldn't actually work as-is
    anyway.&nbsp; That doesn't reduce its instructional value any,
    though, and it doesn't mean that some enterprising individual
    couldn't fix it up now to make it work!&nbsp; In fact, it's quite
    easy to get rid of the assembly-time errors, though whether or not
    that is adequate to get the program into a working state is
    questionable.&nbsp; <br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; As far as
        assembly-time <i>warnings</i> are concerned, almost all warning
        messages produced by the original LVDC assembler, or for that
        matter the modern LVDC assembler we'll talk about below, are
        simply indications that some memory location which naively would
        be in the direct path of the assembly process had already been
        allocated for some other purpose.&nbsp; The assembler was able
        in those cases to transparently jump past the already-allocated
        locations, so other than the fact that slightly more memory and
        execution time was used to do so, there's no significant
        negative impact.&nbsp; In other words, these "warnings" are
        really typically just informational messages that such a
        bypassing jump had been added by the assembler.&nbsp; So while
        41 warnings sounds like quite a lot, they really mean little,
        and are <i>not</i> an indication of a problem in most
        cases.&nbsp; In comparison, the AS-512 flight program, which is
        the final flight version and was fully debugged (to the extent
        that the original developers chose to debug it) itself has a
        couple of hundred of these warnings.</font><br>

              When I say "we" have a copy of this assembly listing,
              however, there's an unfortunate proviso.&nbsp; In the U.S.
              there is something called the International Traffic in
              Arms Regulations (ITAR), which prevents export of certain
              technologies from the U.S. except under strict
              controls.&nbsp; Under my non-expert, non-lawyer reading of
              the ITAR, the LVDC <i>might</i> be such a device whose
              export is prohibited.&nbsp; However, I cannot personally
              figure out whether the LVDC's <i>software</i> would also
              therefore be restricted.&nbsp; If it were restricted, then
              freely providing the software online would be regarded as
              "exporting" it, and would therefore also be
              prohibited!&nbsp; Legal assistance is working through the
              slow process of getting an official ruling on this matter,
              so perhaps one day will have a more-definitive answer as
              to what we can and cannot do with this software from a
              legal standpoint.&nbsp; But so far, many years have been
              spent on this effort, so I wouldn't recommend holding your
              breath.<br>
            </font>
            <p><font color="#cc0000">As it happens, the source code from
                all available assembly-listing printouts have been
                entirely transcribed into machine readable form.&nbsp;
                Those are a lot more convenient to deal with than
                scanned page images, since you can do things like text
                searches on them, or even assemble them using the nifty
                LVDC assembler I've written (<a
                  href="LVDC.html#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler"
                  moz-do-not-send="true">see below</a>).&nbsp; The
                problem, of course, is that the transcribed source code
                is just as much subject (or hopefully, it will
                eventually turn out, <i>not</i> subject) to ITAR export
                restrictions as the scanned images are, so this LVDC
                source code is not presently available in our software
                repository.<br>

            <font color="#cc0000"> Yes, I know that all sounds very
              silly, since there haven't been any Saturn launch vehicles
              since 1973, so nobody is likely to load one of them up
              with a warhead and fire it at anybody ... and never would
              have anyway, due to the tremendous cost involved in
              relation to relatively cheap missiles of other
              varieties.&nbsp; And this software couldn't target
              anything on the ground anyway, since its sole purpose is
              to get stuff into orbit.&nbsp; Nevertheless, although the
              law may be an ass (with apologies to Charles Dickens), it
              is still the law.&nbsp; Until this uncertainty about the
              ITAR status of the LVDC software is cleared up, I am
              forced to regard it as being restricted.&nbsp; According
              to wikipedia, that means that I am allowed to give it to
              only a "<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_person">United




                States person</a>".&nbsp; Therefore, if you want the
              program listing, you must obtain it from me personally and
              provide <a
href="https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/proof-us-citizenship-and-identification-when-applying-a-job">evidence</a>
              that you are a United States person as just described.<br>
              <br>
              The process for convincing me that you are a "United
              States person" has traditionally been somewhat cumbersome,
              and has typically involved sending me digital images of
              appropriate documentation, along with a video telephone
              call so that I can verify that your appearance matches
              photo ID.&nbsp; It is, of course, unwise for you to send
              such personal information to untrusted people — me! — that
              you've met online.&nbsp; Another alternative would be for
              you to pay a lawyer to provide me with a letter assuring
              your status as a United States person, which relieves both
              of us of the burden of trusting each other ... but which
              probably involves a monetary expenditure on your part.<br>

    With all that unpleasantness out of the way, it doesn't seem to me
    that suitably-abridged subsets of the assembly listing would be
    restricted by ITAR, if they do not pertain to guidance, control, or
    other technical aspects of the launch vehicle.&nbsp; <a

      an abridged transcription of the AS-206RAM source code does indeed
      appear in our software repository</a>. &nbsp; The transcribed
    code, unlike the full program, assembles without error and could
    actually be run on an LVDC or LVDC simulator ... or at least could
    be run once I flesh it out enough to do something useful.&nbsp;
    That's an evolving effort, so feel free to take or leave the
    abridged LVDC code as you see fit.<br>
    <blockquote> <font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Alternately, some
        of the points I make in the following discussion are probably
        illustrated equally well by the non-flight PAST program
        discussed in <a href="#PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program">the next
          section</a>, which is definitely not restricted by ITAR and
        hence can be viewed in full by everybody.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I

        existence, when I wrote up this section.<br>

    At the time I originally wrote this description, the afore-mentioned
    abridged AS-206RAM code was something under constant revision, so I
    chose to illustrate the discussion with the scanned page
    images.&nbsp; Here are various images of pages of the assembly
    listing that illustrate things like how constants and variables are
    defined by the software, how some standard mathematical functions
    are encoded, and some of the tabular data generated by the
    assembler:<br>

    There's some additional <a href="#ANATOMY">description of the
      anatomy of these assembly listings</a> farther down on this page.<br>
    <p>The middle group of pages above shows a few auxiliary subroutines
      for computing the sine, cosine, arctangent, and spare root
      functions, plus a 3×3 matrix-multiply routine.&nbsp; Note that
      these are some of the very algorithms described in section 13 of <a
href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/satinstunitibm_5.pdf">the
        EDD (LVDC Equation Defining Document)</a>, so the source code
      can actually be compared to the defining documentation if one so
      desired.&nbsp; The two images at the top show an area of the
      program where some constants are defined, while the two at the
      bottom show a portion of the assembly listing's cross-reference
      table.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    Additionally, each of the flown Saturns is associated with a report
    known as its "launch vehicle flight evaluation report", and <a
      href="links2.html#FlightEvaluation">these reports are available
      for <i>most</i> of the missions</a>, though there are a few
    gaps.&nbsp; Chapter 2 of each of the reports divides the mission
    into a set of "time bases", called T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>,
    ..., T<sub>5</sub>, T<sub>5A</sub>, T<sub>6</sub>, ..., T<sub>9</sub>,
    and each time base itself consists of a series of events that are
    supposed to occur at different times.&nbsp; For example, time base T<sub>0</sub>
    is always the "Guidance Reference Release", and comprises events
    such as "S-IC Engine Start Sequence Command", "S-IC Engine No. 1
    Start", and so on.&nbsp; But in general, not all missions use all of
    the time bases, and the time bases aren't necessarily used for the
    same thing on different missions.<sub><br>
      <br>
    </sub> As noted above, we're pretty sure that for Apollo 12 and
    beyond, a single Generalized Flight Program (GFP) was used.&nbsp;
    Indeed, the AS-512 (Apollo 17) and AS-513 (Skylab1) flight program
    listings definitely are based on the GFP.&nbsp; But we have no good
    information about the missions preceding Apollo 12.&nbsp; By
    examining the time bases on a mission-by-mission basis, it's
    possible to roughly deduce which missions <i>may</i> have flown
    with the same LVDC software (though with differing preloaded
    constants) vs the missions which must necessarily have used a
    different revision of the LVDC software.&nbsp; Thanks to Nik Beug
    for pointing this out.&nbsp; While such an analysis has not been
    done comprehensively, a rough analysis of the gross similarities in
    the time bases might indicate the need for at least the following
    additional LVDC software revisions other than the GFP:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>... prior? ...<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-501 (Apollo 4)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-502 (Apollo 6)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-503 (Apollo 8)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-504 (Apollo 9)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-505 and 506 (Apollo 10-11)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regarding preloaded constants for LVDC memory, all missions (I
      think!) were associated with a report called the "launch vehicle
      operational flight trajectory", and these documents (among other
      things) listed the LVDC preload settings.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
      most of these reports are presently unavailable, though <a
        href="links2.html">we do have a few of them</a>.&nbsp; For
      example, the AS-202 report says that "LVDC symbol" T<sub>1i</sub>,
      the time-to-go for first IGM stage, is preloaded with 299.25 sec,
      while Vex<sub>1</sub>, the J2 exhaust velocity for first IGM
      stage, is loaded with 4165.45 m/sec, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I claimed earlier that the AS-206RAM Flight Program is
      not, of itself, a complete program.&nbsp; In that assessment, I'm
      not referring to the fact that when you try to assemble it you
      find that there are a few missing symbols, associated with
      variables that haven't been allocated.&nbsp; <i>That</i> problem
      is simply due to the fact that the listing we have is an
      engineering version of the code that had never been debugged to
      the point of being released.&nbsp; It's quite easy, I think, to
      fix up the assembly-time errors and warnings in the AS-206RAM so
      that it assembles error-free, and is entirely self-contained in
      that sense.&nbsp; But it is still not complete in the larger sense
      I mean.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Rather, when I say that AS-206RAM is incomplete, I mean that it
      references code at specific hard-coded addresses which are not
      defined by the AS-206RAM program.&nbsp; Indeed, there are large
      areas of core memory left undefined by the program.&nbsp; Even the
      location in memory at which the power-up entry point should be
      stored is left undefined.&nbsp; But for example, consider the
      concrete example of the code necessary for processing commands
      uploaded to the LVDC from mission control, as described in <a
        href="#Up-data">the Up-data section of this web-page</a>.&nbsp;
      When such a command is uploaded to the LVDC, an interrupt
      occurs.&nbsp; The software then looks in an interrupt-vector
      table, which appears on p. 207 of the program listing, and looks
      like the following:<br>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="iptable206RAM.jpg" alt="" width="957"
        height="242"><br>
    </p>
    What the interrupt-vector table contains is <tt>HOP</tt>
    instructions that cause control to be transferred to the routines
    for servicing the various interrupt types ... in this case, an
    uploaded-command interrupt, the instruction that will be executed is
    <tt>HOP HCCMDC</tt>.&nbsp; The symbol <tt>HCCMDC</tt> refers to a
    variable that holds a HOP constant defining the location in memory
    and the data-memory setup for the appropriate interrupt-service
    routine, as defined on p. 20 of the listing:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="hccmdc206RAM.jpg" alt="" width="885"
        height="93"><br>
      <div align="left"><br>
        In other words, the interrupt-service routine for a
        command-upload is in memory module 4, sector 17, and its entry
        point is syllable 1 of location 267.&nbsp; Similarly, the
        data-memory environment associated with that interrupt-service
        routine is module 4, sector 17.<br>
        <br>
        And yet ... the source code contains no code in module 4, sector
        17.&nbsp; Indeed, module 4 sector 17 does not even appear at all
        in the octal listing of the assembled AS-206RAM code.&nbsp; Some
        initialization routines do actually <i>dynamically</i>
        initialize a handful of constants in that sector, but they
        certainly do not seem to put any code at those locations.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus if a command-upload interrupt were to occur, the result
        would be that the software jumped into the middle of a no-man's
        land of uninitialized memory.&nbsp; And it's not just the
        command-upload interrupt, you can see from the image above that
        other no-man's-land jumps could occur as well:&nbsp; to the
        self-test program, to the hardware evaluation program, or upon
        telemetry-station acquisition.<br>
        <br>
        My inference from all that is that there is a separately
        assembled program which provides the code in those locations,
        and <a href="#Preflight_Program">as discussed earlier</a>, the
        best candidate for that at the moment is the Preflight Program
        ... for which we have no source code and no description
        whatsoever.<br>
        <br>
        That's not to say that AS-206RAM cannot be run, if LVDC emulator
        software were to become available.&nbsp; One workaround for this
        specific problem is to simply modify the interrupt-vector table
        to contain a <tt>HOP HCIRTN</tt> instruction in place of the <tt>HOP





























































































          HCCMDC</tt> instruction it contains now.&nbsp; Another
        workaround would be to simply disable the command-upload
        interrupt.&nbsp; But alas, that's just one example of the
        potential range of problems the missing Preflight Program might
        cause.&nbsp; Until a complete survey of all jumps into no-man's
        land is made, it's impossible to know yet whether all of them
        can be worked around so easily.<br>
        <br>
        It's interesting to note that the AS-512 also has references to
        module 4 sector 17, but in the AS-206RAM's case that sector <i>does</i>
        exist in the assembled form of the Flight Program.&nbsp; As you
        can see above (<tt>HCCMDC</tt>), AS-206RAM references 4,17,1,267
        with the comment "<tt>TO COMMAND RECEIVER</tt>".&nbsp; Whereas
        AS-512 (p. 70) references (<tt>M.HD00</tt>) 4,17,0,274 with the
        comment "<tt>INIT. ENTRY , CMND. RECEIVER</tt>", which is in
        fact populated in the assembly of the AS-512 Flight
        Program.&nbsp; But the interpretation of this awaits a
        more-extensive analysis of the AS-512 Flight Program than is
        presently available.<br>
        <h3><a name="PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program"></a>PTC ADAPT
          Self-Test (PAST) Program</h3>
        <p><i><a href="PTC.jpg"><img src="PTC-small.jpg" title="Click to

                height="351" align="right" border="2"></a></i>This
          section concerns the "PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program".&nbsp;
          Since "PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program" is quite a mouthful, I'll
          just refer to it as the PAST program.&nbsp; Not only is that
          nice and short, it's also apt since the PAST program
          chronologically preceded the AS206-RAM Flight Program
          discussed in the preceding section. &nbsp;<img
            src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; But
          beware:&nbsp; The acronym "PAST" is mine, and doesn't come
          from the contemporary Apollo documentation.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, the PAST program is actually not "LVDC"
          software, and it is certainly not <i>flight</i>
          software.&nbsp; But it's really quite significant in spite of
          that, and shouldn't be ignored if you're interested
          technically in the LVDC itself, rather than merely how the
          LVDC fits into the context of the launch vehicle.&nbsp; The
          PAST program fills in an important gaps in our understanding
          of the LVDC and it is technically so close to being "LVDC
          software" that it's really a matter of opinion as to whether
          you want to label it as LVDC software or not.&nbsp;
          (Hint:&nbsp; I <i>do</i> want to call it that.)&nbsp; Let's
          begin the explanation with a little acronym-rich terminology:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The PTC ("Programmable Test Controller"), pictured to the
            right, was ground-based IBM Federal Systems Division
            equipment for evaluating the LVDC and/or LVDA, using either
            the ADAPT or the ASTEC laboratory test equipment. <br>
          </li>
          <li>The ADAPT ("Aerospace Data Adapter/Processor Tester"), in
            turn, was equipment to evaluate the LVDA.</li>
          <li>The ASTEC ("Aerospace System Test And Evaluation Console")
            was equipment to evaluate the LVDC and LVDA separately or to
            evaluate the LVDC/LVDA integration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf">The PTC is
            documented here</a>. (<a
            href="Documents/19730064186_1973064186.pdf">A tiny bit of
            ADAPT and ASTEC documentation is here</a>.)&nbsp; This PTC
          documentation includes (in Chapter 7) a printout of the
          assembly listing of the PAST program and is our only-known
          source for it.&nbsp; <br>
        </p>
        <p>But it's not necessary to go into great detail about the PTC,
          ADAPT, and ASTEC at the moment.&nbsp; Indeed, for our
          immediate purposes, we can ignore the ADAPT and ASTEC entirely
          and the only important things to know about the PTC are:<br>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The PTC contains a CPU ... <i>which is a modified LVDC</i>.&nbsp;




































































































            In saying this, I don't mean that the PTC has a modified
            LVDC mounted in it, but rather that the PTC's CPU is a
            reimplementation (albeit modified) of an LVDC CPU.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The PTC's CPU runs software ... in this case, the PAST
            program, though it could and usually did run other LVDC
            software loaded into it by the developers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In some sense, you can think of the PTC as a large LVDC that
          has been fixed up to allow various kinds of debugging
          activities.&nbsp; For example, the PTC provides support via
          circuitry enabling things like single-stepping through the
          software.&nbsp; (In the PTC documentation, see section 2-80,
          "External Control Element"; section 2-216, "External Control
          Logic Circuits".)&nbsp; It's the fact that the PTC's CPU is a
          "modified" LVDC which means the PAST program is not strictly
          LVDC software.&nbsp; Rather, it's modified-LVDC
          software.&nbsp; Still, except for small number of differences
          I'll list in a minute, the PAST program matches LVDC Flight
          Program syntax.&nbsp; Indeed, its assembly listing has clearly
          been produced by the LVDC assembler program, although there
          are a few differences in the way some of the output is
          formatted.&nbsp; In terms of how the PTC's CPU has been
          "modified" relative to the LVDC, those changes are described
          in detail later but here's a list of some of the differences
          visible at the software level, though admittedly it may not be
          too meaningful to you until you study more about how the LVDC
          works (and particularly its instruction set) later on:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The HOP register is parsed into fields slightly
            differently.<br>
          </li>
          <li>LVDC CPU instructions eliminated in the PTC CPU:&nbsp; <tt>MPY</tt>
            and <tt>MPH</tt> (both of which are multiplication
            instructions), <tt>DIV</tt> (divide), and <tt>EXM</tt>
            ("execute modified").</li>
          <li> Instructions added to the PTC but not present in
            LVDC:&nbsp; <tt>PRS</tt> (printer operation) and <tt>CIO</tt>
            (CPU i/o control).</li>
          <li>Instructions that are a little different:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><tt>CDS</tt> (set data sector) and <tt>RSU</tt>
              (reverse subtract) have the same functionality as for
              LVDC, but their instruction words are coded slightly
              differently.</li>
            <li><tt>SHF</tt> (logical shift) remains similar, but no
              longer has a "clear accumulator" function and can shift by
              up to 6 positions (rather than just by 1 or 2).</li>
            <li><tt>XOR</tt> and <tt>RSU</tt> (reverse subract) use
              different opcodes than the LVDC does, but are otherwise
              identical.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Other:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a single "residual" memory sector, in memory
              module 0, serving all memory modules.&nbsp; (Whereas the
              LVDC has a separate residual sector for each memory
              module.)<br>
            </li>
            <li><strike>Boot:&nbsp; Execution begins at memory module 0,
                sector 0, syllable 0, location 0.&nbsp; (Whereas for the
                LVDC, module 0, sector 0, location 0 contains an address
                at which execution should begin.)</strike></li>
            <li>The assembler has a few non-LVDC pseudo-ops it
              recognizes, and few LVDC pseudo-ops which it does
              not.&nbsp; For example, the PTC has an <tt>ORG</tt>
              (origin) pseudo-op where the LVDC has the
              functionally-equivalent <tt>ORGDD</tt> pseudo-op. <br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>How can I justify my claim that the PAST program is
          "significant" and thus deserves your attention?&nbsp; There
          are actually quite a few reasons to think so:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>As self-test software, significant chunks of the program
            are devoted to testing the CPU instructions themselves;
            i.e., deep, system-level self-test code which is not present
            in the AS206-RAM Flight Program.&nbsp; In AGC terms, the
            PAST program most resembles our "Validation Test Suite"
            program ... except that being instead of being written by
            the Virtual AGC Project (as the Validation Test Suite was,
            because MIT/IL itself hadn't left us any AGC self-test
            software as far as we could determine at the time), the PAST
            program was actually supplied by the IBM Federal Systems
            Division itself.&nbsp; This will obviously be very helpful
            in validating any eventual LVDC CPU emulator we may be able
            to come up with, since developers of emulations are always
            faced with uncomfortable questions about the accuracy those
            emulations.&nbsp; Unfortunately, experience with the AGC
            suggests that the <i>most</i>-interesting CPU instructions
            to check would have been the very instructions which the PTC
            omits from its repertoire, and therefore the PAST software
            cannot test them.&nbsp; But that's a minor quibble.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
          <li>Indeed, speaking of LVDC-CPU emulation, running the PAST
            program in an LVDC emulation should in some ways be even
            more convenient than running an LVDC flight program, since
            (as a black box) the LVDC itself has no user interface as
            such, although you could consider its telemetered data
            streams as being a kind of "user interface".&nbsp; Whereas
            the PTC <i>does</i> have a user interface of sorts,
            including a plotter, printer, typewriter (keyboard), various
            electronic displays, and switches. Thus the learning curve
            for seeing an emulated LVDC actually <i>do something</i> is
            much gentler for the PAST program than it would be for an
            LVDC flight program, since the normal behavior of the PAST
            program is already to interact with the test
            technician.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
          <li>Nor is the PAST program a light-weight in terms of size,
            being nearly 60% the size of the AS206-RAM Flight Program,
            both in terms of page-count of source code and in terms of
            the size of the assembled executable.&nbsp; The structure of
            the PAST program is quite simple, which means that much of
            its bulk is related to repetition and variation of simple
            blocks of code rather than to complexity of software
            structure.&nbsp; Pedagogically, I suppose you could argue
            the latter point as being either an disadvantage or an
            advantage, depending on your point of view.<br>
          </li>
          <li>And there's no question of the PAST program's "export"
            being restricted by ITAR:&nbsp; It isn't, since it can't
            even be run within the launch vehicle's computer!&nbsp; So
            it can be freely provided to you, and you need not (please
            don't!) apply personally to me to get access to it (as you
            still have to do for the AS206-RAM Flight Program).&nbsp;
            Just follow the links given below.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As far as the versioning of the software, there is nothing
          embedded within the assembly listing itself which dates
          it.&nbsp; However, given that it is printed in the PTC
          document mentioned above, which is dated 5 MARCH 1965, I think
          we can tentatively suppose that the PAST program too is from
          early 1965.&nbsp; (Whereas the AS206-RAM program is from late
          1967.)<br>
        </p>
        <p>Beyond that, there's also the academic question of the
          versioning of the LVDC assembler used.&nbsp; Both the feature
          set and the format of the output is more primitive in the PAST
          assembly than in the AS206-RAM assembly.&nbsp; For all these
          reasons, it's fair to infer that an earlier version of the
          assembler was used for the PTC assembly, in which various
          more-advanced convenience features did not yet exist.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The PAST program's source code has been transcribed into
          textual form, so that it can be <a
            href="#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">assembled</a>.&nbsp;

        <p>I should note that while this code assembles 100% correctly —
          i.e., without errors, and producing octal executables 100%
          identical to those of the original scanned assembly listing —
          there were nevertheless some behaviors (and perhaps bugs) of
          the original assembler that I've not yet been able to figure
          out how to mimic in the modern assembler.&nbsp; Thus to get an
          assembled output identical to the original, some workaround
          code consisting of a handful of <tt>ORG</tt>, <tt>DOG</tt>,
          and <tt>TRA</tt> pseudo-ops and instructions have been
          inserted into the source code.&nbsp; Hopefully it will be
          possible to update the modern assembler at some point in the
          future, and thus eliminate the workarounds.<br>
        </p>
        <p>You can also look at the scanned assembly listing created by
          the Apollo-era assembler.&nbsp; To make it a little more
          convenient to work with, I've extracted the listing from the
          original scanned PTC document linked earlier, so that it can
          be viewed as a set of image files, one per scanned page of the
          listing:<br>

    Among these, it would be fair to state that reference #3 was used
    primarily (the instruction set is covered in table 2-8 on pp. 2-16
    through 2-20), and the others were used to cross-check or to provide
    guidance or information missing from reference #3.&nbsp; (In
    retrospect, however, I would recommend reference #4 as a better
    starting point to those readers who don't find <i>my</i> musings
    amusing, though it does not cover the instruction set.)&nbsp; Where
    there were discrepancies between earlier documents and later
    documents, the later documents were treated as definitive.

    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 1371px;
        height: 771px;" alt="" src="LVDC-block-diagram.jpg" width="1371"
        height="771"><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> The illustration above shows a
        simplified block diagram of the LVDC.&nbsp; The device itself
        was designed and manufactured by IBM Federal Systems
        Division.&nbsp; Mechanically, the LVDC had dimensions of about
        29.5"×12.5"×10.5", and weighed about 72.5 pounds.&nbsp; A number
        of different power supplies were needed:&nbsp; +6V, -3V, +12V,
        and +20V, at roughly 150W.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        However, the LVDC and the Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA)
        really operated as a pair, and neither is of use without the
        other, so in considering the mechanical and electrical
        characteristics of the LVDC one really needs to include those of
        those of the LVDA into their thinking.&nbsp; The LVDA had
        dimensions of about TBD"×TBD"×TBD", and weighed about 214
        pounds.&nbsp; Its electrical budget was about 320W and it
        accepted +28V power.&nbsp; The purpose of the LVDA was basically
        to intermediate between the LVDC and the remainder of the
        rocket.<br>
        <br>
        In computer terms, LVDC had the following characteristics:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>The computer was triply redundant, with 3 identical
            circuits conforming to the block diagram shown above.&nbsp;
            There was a "voting" circuit not shown, and any two of the 3
            sub-systems could outvote the other on every output control
            signal.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory was ferrite core and was entirely RAM.&nbsp; In
            other words, there was no ROM memory as there was in the
            AGC.&nbsp; This meant that the flight program could
            theoretically be changed much closer to flight time than
            could the program of the AGC, but it also meant that the
            program contained within the computer could be destroyed
            much more easily than with the AGC.&nbsp; (But remember, the
            operating life of the LVDC was very short compared to that
            of the AGC.)&nbsp; Actually, reading RAM based on ferrite
            cores is inherently destructive, so every read must be
            accompanied by a write-back operation to restore the
            contents of memory.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory words were 28 bits, with 2 of those bits being for
            parity, and thus the data portion of memory words was only
            26 bits.&nbsp; Memory was accessed serially, at a 512K
            bits/second rate, though this fact is not relevant as far as
            software coding is concerned.</li>
          <li>Each memory word was logically subdivided into two 14-bit
            "syllables" (13 data bits + 1 parity bit), and computer
            instructions were encoded in 13 bits.&nbsp; Therefore, each
            memory word could hold two computer instructions, one in
            each syllable.&nbsp; Data, on the other hand, required a
            complete word.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The total amount of memory varied from mission to mission,
            I believe.&nbsp; The LVDC could be populated with up to 8
            modules of memory, with each module comprising 16 "sectors"
            of 256 words each (4096 words), for a maximum of 32768
            words.&nbsp; One word in each block wasn't memory as such
            but was a mirror of the CPU's Product-Quotient Register (see
            below), so the usable memory in each block was really only
            4095 words.&nbsp;<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory could be operated in two different modes, under
            program control, called "simplex" and "duplex".&nbsp; In
            "duplex" mode, the memory was divided into two banks, each
            of which was an identical mirror of the other in order to
            improve reliability, whereas in "simplex" mode the memory
            wasn't redundant in this way (though it was still triply
            redundant as mentioned above) but the number of memory words
            was double.&nbsp; In duplex mode, the odd-numbered modules
            mirrored the even-numbered modules, so that one would
            typically used only modules 0, 2, 4, and 6 in duplex
            mode.&nbsp; For the AS-206RAM LVDC Flight Program, a simplex
            model was required.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The basic CPU clock was 2048 KHz, but computer
            instructions were executed in a "computer cycle" time which
            was 82.03125μs.&nbsp; The latter may seem like an unusual
            number, but where it comes from is that each instruction
            required reading/writing 3 syllables (1 holding the
            instruction and 2 holding the data) of 14 bits each, with
            each bit requiring 4 clocks to process. 3×14×4=168, so the
            computer cycle was 168/(2.048MHz)=82.03125μs.&nbsp; Although
            most instructions took a single computer cycle, some
            instructions (particularly multiplication and division) took
            longer.&nbsp; The longest instruction, <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">MPH</span>,
            took 5 cycles.&nbsp; The <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>
            instructions (see below) theoretically took only a single
            cycle, but could only begin their operations in that amount
            of time, and the results weren't accessible until later (4
            cycles total for <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and 8 cycles total for
            <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>).<br>
          </li>
          <li>Arithmetic was 2's complement, integer only.</li>
          <li>There were two arithmetic units, one of which could
            perform addition, subtractions, and logical operations,
            whilst the other could perform multiplication and
            division.&nbsp; The two units could be operated
            independently, which is significant because multiplications
            required 4 computer cycles and divisions required 8 computer
            cycles, and instruction execution could continue while the
            multiplication or division proceeded.&nbsp; In other words,
            one could begin a multiplication or division, proceed to
            execute some unrelated instructions, and then later fetch
            the results of completed multiplication or division.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>The Accumulator Register.</li>
      <li>The Product-Quotient Register (or just P-Q Register) can be
        accessed at address 0775 (octal) regardless of which memory
        modules and sectors were currently selected.&nbsp; (This happens
        to be an address in the "residual sector", as described below,
        so it represents a single address in each memory module rather
        than an address within each memory sector.)&nbsp; However, it is
        used by the <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>
        instructions (see below) and therefore cannot be treated as an
        ordinary memory location.</li>
      <li>The HOP Register, discussed further below.</li>
      <li>... and various hidden registers not directly relevant to
        software:&nbsp; the Transfer Register, the Address Register, the
        Data Module Register, the Data Sector Register, the Instruction
        Sector Register, the Operation Code Register, and the Memory
        Buffer Registers.</li>
    </ul>
    There are some memory words in the "residual sector" (see below)
    that are real memory (unlike 0775), but nevertheless have special
    purposes and so should be avoided for general usage:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>0400 stores a HOP Register code (see below) for vectoring to
        interrupts.<br>
      </li>
      <li>0600, 0640, 0700, 0740 are used for the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
        instruction (see below).</li>
      <li>0776, 0777 are used for the "HOP save" feature (see below).</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, at boot-up time:&nbsp; Execution begins at address
    0-00-0-000 (i.e., memory module 0, sector 00, syllable 0, location
    000) with the data-memory module and sector set to 0 and 00,
    respectively.&nbsp; None of our available LVDC flight programs
    covers any code at address 0-00-0-000, which is yet one more reason
    to believe in the separate Preflight Program.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; For a very long
        time, I had instead stated that at boot-up the LVDC acted as if
        there were a HOP constant (see below) stored at address
        0-00-000, and that the starting instruction pointer, data-memory
        module, and data-memory sector were determined by this HOP
        constant.&nbsp; It now appears that the LVDC documentation was
        somewhat ambiguous — or in vulgar terms, <i>wrong</i>, making
        me wrong as well — on this point, and that LVDC booted up in the
        same manner as the PTC, as described in the preceding
        paragraph.&nbsp; </font><br>

      Memory Words</h3>

    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 896px; height:
        166px;" alt="" src="LVDC-BitPositions.jpg" width="896"
        height="166"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The illustration above depicts the data organization within a memory
    word.&nbsp;&nbsp; For numeric data, there is a sign bit (designated
    "S" in the illustration), with the bit labeled "1" being the
    most-significant bit and the bit labeled "25" being the
    least-significant bit.&nbsp; For non-numeric data, the bits were
    designated instead as "1" through "26", with no overlap between the
    designation of the bits for numeric data.&nbsp; A very curious
    system indeed, in modern thinking!<br>
    <br>
    The situation is even curiouser, to paraphrase Alice, when
    considering instructions stored in the syllables in place of numeric
    data.&nbsp; In those cases the bits are interpreted as in the
    following illustration:<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 899px; height:
        169px;" alt="" src="LVDC-InstructionPositions.jpg" width="899"
        height="169"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    In the normal processing of a block of code, the syllable remains
    constant.&nbsp; For example, if syllable 0 is currently selected,
    then all of the instructions executed are in syllable 0, at
    consecutive addresses, and none of the instructions in syllable 1
    are processed.&nbsp; In particular, the instruction at syllable 1 is
    <i>not</i> the next one processed after the instruction at syllable
    0 ... unless of course, the instruction in syllable 0 is a <tt>TRA</tt>
    or a <tt>HOP</tt> to the instruction in syllable 1!&nbsp; Indeed,
    syllable 1 need not even store an instruction at all.&nbsp; Thus the
    instructions stored in syllables 0 and 1 are generally unrelated to
    each other, since they often belong to independent blocks of
    code.&nbsp; Of course, it also happens <i>sometimes</i> in a long
    routine that the instruction at syllable 0 may be used early in the
    routine and that the instruction at syllable 1, at the same address,
    may be used much later in the same routine; but don't count on it. <br>
    <br>
    In most cases, the bits labeled OP1-OP4 contain an instruction code
    and the bits A1-A9 contain an address in the range 0-511 on which
    the instruction operates.&nbsp; There are, however, a few
    instructions in which A9 and/or A8 also form a part of the
    instruction code, in which case the addressable range is
    smaller.&nbsp; Note that bits A1-A9 are neither in consecutive order
    within the memory word, nor are they in an order which would be
    consistent with the ordering of bits in data words.<br>
    <br>
    These oddities in bit-ordering are due to the fact that memory was
    read serially into the CPU, so the ordering of the bits is optimized
    to mimic the order in which the CPU needed to use them.<br>
    <br>
    For the purpose of executing instructions, memory is considered as
    being divided into "sectors" of 256 words each.&nbsp; Address bits
    A1-A8 select an offset into a sector, while A9 (known as the
    "residual bit") selects which sector is being addressed.&nbsp; When
    A9 is 0, the currently-selected sector is being addressed, while
    when A9 is 1 a special sector called the "residual sector" is being
    addressed.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The "residual
      sector" is always sector 017 (octal)</span>, in the current memory
    module for LVDC, or in module 0 for PTC.&nbsp; (I.e., the LVDC has a
    separate residual sector in each module, whereas the PTC simply has
    a single residual sector, in module 0, no matter which memory module
    is selected.)&nbsp; <br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; The "residual
        sectors" provide a flexible way of accessing variables.&nbsp; On
        the other hand, they <i>could</i> be used to hold instructions
        as well as variables.&nbsp; It's just that by doing so, you can
        only access instructions if the currently-selected instruction
        sector happens to point to that selfsame residual sector.&nbsp;
        In other words, you can't access instructions by using the A9
        address bit I mentioned above, and that A9 bit is what makes the
        residual sectors special in the first place.&nbsp; So if the
        residual sector is used to store instructions, you're basically
        not taking advantage of its special features, and are simply
        treating it like any other memory sector.&nbsp; That's kind of a
        waste, given that only ~7% of LVDC memory resides in residual
        sectors, and an even tinier fraction of PTC memory.&nbsp; It's
        in accessing variables rather than instructions that the
        residual sector shines.&nbsp; Nevertheless, with that said, both
        the AS-512 and AS-513 Flight Programs do devote a couple of
        residual sectors to instructions rather than to data.&nbsp;
        Whether or not it's worthwhile doing that just depends on your
        particular needs.&nbsp; If you use the </font><font size="-1"><tt>EXM</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> instruction (see below), you'll definitely need to
        store at least a few instructions in residual sectors.<br>
      </font></blockquote>
    Memory-sector selection and the "residual sector" become clearer
    when contemplating the HOP Register mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Here is
    the LVDC's version of the HOP Register:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 868px; height:
        293px;" alt="" src="LVDC-HopRegister.jpg" width="868"
        height="293"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The PTC is simpler than the LVDC, in that it contains a maximum of 2
    memory modules, and has no duplex vs simplex configuration.&nbsp;
    The LVDC's and PTC's HOP Registers are compatible, though at first
    glance it may not seem that they are, due to different numbering
    conventions for the positioning — sign bit vs no sign bit — in the
    images above and below.&nbsp; Here is the PTC's version of the HOP
    Register:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="PTC-HOP.png" alt="" width="846"
        height="163"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The meanings of these fields may already be clear to you, but just
    in case they are not:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Bits IM1-IM3 (not contiguous) select the memory module from
        which instructions are fetched.&nbsp; (Recall that there are up
        to 8 memory modules installed in the LVDC.&nbsp; The PTC has
        only 2.)</li>
      <li>Bit DUPIN selects whether the portion of memory from which
        instructions are fetched is accessed in duplex mode or in
        simplex mode.&nbsp; (Recall that in duplex mode there is only
        half the addressable memory as in simplex mode, because the
        memory is dual-redundant and half of the memory mirrors the
        other half.)</li>
      <li>Bits IS1-IS4 select the 256-word sector within the selected
        memory module from which instructions are fetched.</li>
      <li>Bits A1-A8 (the Instruction Counter) point to the next
        instruction word to be fetched from the selected sector in the
        selected block.</li>
      <li>Bit SYL indicates the next instruction syllable in the next
        instruction word.</li>
      <li>And similarly, bits DM1-DM3, bit DUPDN, and bits DS1-DS4 serve
        analogous purposes except for data words rather than instruction
        words.</li>
    </ul>
    Upon reset, the LVDC's CPU loads the HOP Register with the value
    stored at address 000 (presumably in memory module 0 sector 0), and
    this determines where LVDC program execution starts.&nbsp; The PTC's
    CPU simply loads the HOP Register with a literal 000000000, so PTC
    program execution always starts at 0-00-0-000.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="Dimitris"></a>Below are some photos sent to us by Dimitris
    Vitoris of an LVDC "page assembly".&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't
    know exactly what this particular page assembly does, but don't be
    fooled by the array-like regularity of the design into supposing
    these are memory.&nbsp; They're not, since LVDC memory consisted of
    ferrite cores and not surface-mounted flatpacks.<br>
    <br>
    The term <i>page assembly</i> refers to plug-in modular circuit
    boards used to build the LVDC and LVDA, and not to the specific
    functionality the individual module provides.&nbsp; Each page
    assembly contains a printed circuit board with up to 35 "Unit Logic
    Devices" (ULD) on the top side, and another 35 on the bottom
    side.&nbsp; The ULDs were themselves designed by IBM, rather than
    being off-the-shelf components from other manufacturers; as a
    consequence, there aren't ULD datasheets floating around, and
    there's not a lot of information about them.&nbsp; But here's a
    little info we've been able to glean.&nbsp; Most of the explanations
    about their functionality came from the "Logic Symbols" Appendix of
    <a
href="Documents/LaboratoryMaintenanceInstructionsForLVDC-Volume1-GeneralDescriptionAndTheory.pdf">this
























































































      document</a>, which also describes a number of other symbols that
    may or may not be ULDs as well.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>AA — a network which can provide several combinations of logic
        functions, depending on wiring:&nbsp; e.g., 4 2-input AND gates,
        2 4-input AND gates, etc.<br>
      </li>
      <li>CDR — a pull-up/down resistor.<br>
      </li>
      <li>CLI — TBD<br>
      </li>
      <li>CLN — a resistor-divider network.</li>
      <li>DD — logical disagreement detector.&nbsp; (Detects if any 1 of
        3 inputs differs from the other 2 inputs.)</li>
      <li>DDI — TBD</li>
      <li>FP 2412 — a pair of PNP transistors.&nbsp; This is technically
        not a "ULD", but can be installed in a ULD location.<br>
      </li>
      <li>HCI — high-current inverter.</li>
      <li>INV — an AND gate and a NAND gate.<br>
      </li>
      <li>TMV — a logical majority detector.&nbsp; (Output is the
        majority of the 3 inputs.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>VI — a logical inverter, capable of driving 10 AND-get inputs.</li>
      <li>VIP — TBD</li>
      <li>... and presumably a number others, although the documentation
        suggests that an effort was made to minimize the number of
        types.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    (I'm not really sure which is the best photo from Dimitris, so I've
    just included them all.)<br>

          <td>The <tt>HOP</tt> instruction provides an unconditional
            jump instruction that also simultaneously changes the
            instruction-memory and data-memory contexts.&nbsp; To
            perform this operation, a "HOP constant" is needed,
            specifying not only the desired instruction-memory sector
            and data-memory sector, but the target offset into the
            desired instruction-memory sector as well.&nbsp; The operand
            is the address of the memory location (in the current or
            residual data sector) containing the HOP constant.<br>
            <br>
            The following example codes an unconditional jump from <tt>HERE</tt>
            to <tt>THERE</tt> by means of a <tt>HOP</tt>:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>HERE&nbsp; &nbsp;

            </blockquote>
            The need to explicitly code the HOP constant for every jump
            is is obviously a big pain in the neck, though convenient if
            the target location changes throughout execution rather than
            being known at assembly time.<br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, in assembly listings you'll also sometimes
            see the "instruction" <tt>HOP*</tt>. &nbsp; But there is no
            machine instruction such as <tt>HOP*</tt>.&nbsp; At the
            machine level there is only <tt>HOP</tt>, as described in
            the preceding paragraph.&nbsp; Rather, the presence of the "<tt>*</tt>"
            indicates an assembly-language convention that's a
            workaround for the inconvenience of having to hard-code HOP
            constants.&nbsp; The convention is that <tt>HOP*</tt>'s
            operand can be a left-hand symbol for the target location in
            the code rather than the left-hand symbol of a <tt>HOP</tt>
            constant of that target location.&nbsp; The example code
            above would change to something like this:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>HERE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt>HOP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            But the apparent simplicity of <tt>HOP*</tt> conceals a lot
            of stuff under the surface.&nbsp; What the assembler does
            for <tt>HOP*</tt> is to <i>automatically</i> allocate what
            I earlier called <tt>HTHERE</tt>:<br>
            <ul>
            </ul>
            <ol>
              <li>It allocates a data word in the current data
                sector.&nbsp; It does this by searching upward in the
                data sector, looking for the first unused
                location.&nbsp; The residual sector is searched if
                there's no room left in the current sector.<br>
              </li>
              <li>It then creates a HOP constant for the target
                location, and stores it in the newly-allocated data
                word.</li>
              <li>Finally, it uses the address of the newly-allocated
                data word as the operand for the <tt>HOP</tt>
                instruction.</li>
            </ol>
            It is not entirely clear — in fact it has been subject to
            lively discussion — whether the <tt>*</tt> for <tt>HOP*</tt>
            needed to be present in the original computer punch-cards
            for the source code or not.&nbsp; The <i>modern</i> LVDC
            assembler can deduce for itself whether it needs to treat
            the <tt>*</tt> as being present; it thus ignores the <tt>*</tt>
            if present, but prints a <tt>*</tt> in the output listing
            if appropriate.&nbsp; Given that <tt>HOP</tt> vs <tt>HOP*</tt>
            can be automated in this fashion, my assumption was
            generally that the original assembler did not need the <tt>*</tt>
            in the source code but simply printed it in the assembly
            listing.&nbsp; In the AS-512 assembly listing, however,
            there is some circumstantial evidence that the <tt>*</tt>
            did need to be present for the original assembler.&nbsp;
            (The evidence is that there are program comments in which
            the string "<tt>HOP*</tt>" appears.)&nbsp; Alas, we have no
            contemporary LVDC programmer's manual or other resource
            providing an answer to this question.<br>

            This is a multiplication instruction.&nbsp; It multiplies
            two 24-bit numbers to produce a 26-bit product.&nbsp; The
            accumulator provides the address of one operand, and the
            address embedded in the instruction points to the other
            operand.&nbsp; Recall that A1-A8 select the offset within a
            256-word sector, and A9 is the "residual bit" that selects
            between the current sector and the "residual sector".&nbsp;
            In both cases, the most-significant 24-bits of the operands
            are used, and the least-significant 2 bits of the operand
            are ignored.&nbsp; A partial product (24 bits from the
            addressed memory times the 12 less-significant bits from the
            accumulator) can be fetched from the P-Q Register (0775
            octal) on the 2nd instruction (or more accurately, two
            computer cycles) following <span style="font-family:

            is no need to do so if that value isn't desired by the
            program.&nbsp; The full product is available from the
            accumulator or from the P-Q Register on the 4th instruction
            (more accurately, 4 computer cycles) following <span

            See also the discussion of the <a href="#BCI"><tt>BCI</tt></a>
            pseudo-op, farther down on this page, which is a convenient
            way in assembly language to encode memory-operand data for <tt>PRS</tt>.<br>
            <br>
            Each <tt>PRS</tt> instruction conveys 26 bits of data to
            the printer, and that 26-bit word is capable of encoding
            either 4 or 12 characters.&nbsp; The number of characters
            encoded depends on whether the printer is in "octal mode"
            (activated by the <tt>CIO 164</tt> instruction) or "BCD
            mode" (activated by the <tt>CIO 170</tt> instruction). The
            term "BCD mode" is a misnomer, in modern terms, since it
            would seem to imply that it covers only Binary Coded
            Decimals, whereas in fact it covers the complete repertoire
            of printable characters.&nbsp; Besides those, see also <tt>CIO





























































              160</tt>, which conveys certain control commands to the
            printer.<br>
            <br>
            In octal mode, the 26 data bits comprise 8 octal character
            encoded as 3 bits each (000="0", 001="1", ..., 111="7"),
            plus a single "2-bit character", plus three blanks (which
            are always present, and thus require no bits to
            encode).&nbsp; So far, I've found no written explanation of
            what these "2-bit characters" are, but due to the way 26-bit
            data words are invariably represented in LVDC/PTC assembly
            listings — namely, as 9 octal digits with the final one
            being <i>even</i> — I feel confident that the 9th character
            is encoded as 00="0", 01="2", 10="4", 11="6". <br>
            <br>
            In BCD mode, the 26 data bits comprise 4 6-bit character
            code, left-aligned in the data word.&nbsp; In other words,
            the first character's most-significant bit appears at the
            SIGN bit of the 26-bit word.&nbsp; The least-significant 2
            bits of the data word are not used as far as I can
            tell.&nbsp; (That's a pity, because it seems to me that it
            would be reasonable to use them to indicate <i>how many</i>
            characters the word contained, rather than just always being
            4.&nbsp; Alas, that doesn't seem to be the case.)&nbsp; The
            6-bit encoding scheme, called "BA8421", is covered in the
            discussion of the <a href="#BCI"><tt>BCI</tt></a>
            pseudo-op.<br>
            <br>
            The <tt>PRS</tt> instruction has a side effect:&nbsp; It
            overwrites the interrupt latch.&nbsp; This potentially
            triggers interrupts if not inhibited; or, more usefully, the
            interrupt latch can be read back using the <tt>CIO 154</tt>
            instruction for self-test purposes.&nbsp; Which particular
            bits are set depends on which characters are being
            printed.&nbsp; I can't give you too satisfactory a rationale
            as to the particular bit patterns used.&nbsp; Nor are they
            documented (unless they can be deduced from the 2nd-level
            schematics, which I've failed at so far).&nbsp; So all I can
            do is infer the bit patterns from how the PAST program
            source code uses them.&nbsp; But take what I say with <i>a
              <u>big</u> grain of salt</i>, because there's no unique
            way of making these inferences!&nbsp; With that said, here
            are the rules for deriving the interrupt-latch patterns that
            I've built into the PTC emulation software.&nbsp; The bit
            patterns are all 12-bit codes (stored in SIGN and bits 1-11
            of the interrupt latch) as follows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A group mark (<tt>CIO 774</tt>):&nbsp; 0047<sub>8</sub>
              </li>
              <ul>
              </ul>
              <li>Character data (<tt>CIO 775</tt>, or <tt>CIO 000</tt>
                through <tt>CIO 773</tt>):</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Bits SIGN, 1-5:&nbsp; Logical OR, bitwise, of the
                  6-bit BA8421 codes for all characters encoded in the
                  data.&nbsp; In octal mode, this is additionally OR'd
                  with 12<sub>8</sub>.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Bit 6:&nbsp; Parity bit.&nbsp; Computation of this
                  can't be easily described concisely, so there's an
                  extended explanation below.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Bits 7-11:&nbsp; 03<sub>8</sub>.</li>
                <li>Bits 12-25:&nbsp; 0.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>The parity bit for character data appears to be an odd
              parity bit for the <i>most-recently</i> processed
              character of the 4 (BCD mode) or 12 (octal mode) encoded
              in the 26-bit data word at the time <tt>CIO 154</tt> is
              issued to read back the interrupt latch.&nbsp; The
              characters are processed sequentially after the <tt>PRS</tt>
              instruction is executed.&nbsp; The 4 characters in BCD
              mode can be processed within a single CPU instruction
              cycle, but the 12 characters in octal mode cannot be, and
              require two instruction cycles to fully process.&nbsp; I
              think that the timing for this processing is not
              synchronized with the CPU clock, and indeed has some
              tolerance in terms of frequency, so that it cannot be
              known deterministically how many characters have been
              processed until enough machine cycles have elapsed to
              guarantee that <i>all</i> characters have been
              processed.&nbsp; I suspect that's why all octal-mode <tt>PRS</tt>
              test cases in the PAST program consist of strings of
              characters having all the <i>same</i> parity; that way,
              it doesn't matter which specific character has just been
              processed, because the parity of each character is the
              same anyway.<br>
            </p>
            <p>This leaves many questions unanswered about the precise
              original behavior of the PTC panel.&nbsp; Therefore,
              ignoring the original behavior and thinking just in terms
              of how the PTC <i>emulation</i> implements the parity in
              the face of this indeterminacy, I recognize 3 distinct

            <ol>
              <li>Immediate readback.&nbsp; In this case the emulation
                returns the parity for the 2nd character in the data

          <td>This is a conditional jump instruction, which branches to

            is not zero, but simply continues to the next instruction in
            sequence if the accumulator is zero.&nbsp; Bits A1-A8 of the
            embedded address represent the new offset within the
            currently selected 256-word instruction sector, while bit A9
            gives the syllable number within that word.&nbsp;&nbsp; The

            sector and data sector are not changed by the jump.<br>
            <br>
            As mentioned, the target address for the machine instruction
            itself had to be within the current sector, because its
            8-bit address offset is embedded within the
            instruction.&nbsp; However, the assembler would
            transparently work around this problem, allowing essentially
            <i>any</i> target address to be used.&nbsp; For the sake of
            discussion, imagine an assembly language instruction,<br>
            <blockquote><tt>TNZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OINIT</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            in which the target location <tt>OINIT</tt> is not in the
            current memory sector.&nbsp; The workaround procedure used
            by the assembler was this:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Working downward from the top of the current
                instruction-memory sector, find an unallocated memory
                location.</li>
              <li>In that newly-allocated memory location, put a "<tt>HOP







































































































































                  OINIT</tt>" instruction.</li>
              <li>Use the newly-allocated memory location as the target
                of the <tt>TNZ</tt> instruction.</li>
              <li>In the assembly listing, display the operator as "<tt>TNZ*</tt>"
                rather than "<tt>TNZ</tt>". <br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            Of course, this workaround preserves the intended logic, at
            the cost of an extra instruction word and a couple of extra
            machine cycles generated transparently by the assembler.<br>
            <br>
            The distinction between <tt>TNZ</tt> and <tt>TNZ*</tt> is
            reminiscent of the distinction between <tt>HOP</tt> and <tt>HOP*</tt>
            discussed earlier.&nbsp; As with <tt>HOP*</tt>, it is is
            unclear whether the <tt>*</tt> for <tt>TNZ*</tt> was
            present in the source code or not.&nbsp; It is therefore my
            assumption (and the modern LVDC assembler's assumption) that
            <tt>TNZ</tt> (without <tt>*</tt>) was always used in source
            code, while the <tt>*</tt> in <tt>TNZ*</tt> is only
            present in assembly listings.&nbsp; I am unaware of any
            evidence to the contrary.<br>

            What about the carry bit?&nbsp; As far as I can tell, the
            CPU has no provision for carry bit that's useful at the
            software level.&nbsp; If you want to do multi-word precision
            arithmetic (say, 52-bit addition instead of just 26-bit
            addition), then you have to find some indirect,
            software-only way of detecting carry rather than on relying
            on the CPU to provide you with some easy way of handling
            it.&nbsp; It's certainly mathematically possible to do
            so:&nbsp; When adding two addends of the <i>same</i> sign
            using 2's-complement arithmetic, you can detect carry
            because the sum has the opposite sign of the addends,
            whereas adding two addends of <i>opposite</i> signs cannot
            result in carry anyway.&nbsp; But the coding to exploit this
            mathematical possibility is obviously going to be cumbersome
            and inconvenient.&nbsp; (The low-level adder circuit itself
            can deal with a carry bit, of course.&nbsp; The adder
            performs additions serially, starting with the
            least-significant bit and moving upward to the
            most-significant, and at each bit-stage there's a carry bit
            from the previous stage to worry about.&nbsp; However, the
            final carry bit is not accessible to software, and the
            carry-bit latch is cleared by any <tt>CLA</tt> instruction,
            making it very tough to transfer the carry-bit latch's
            contents from one word-addition to the next.&nbsp; In
            theory, if you could figure out a way to do multi-precision
            arithmetic without using <tt>CLA</tt>, perhaps you could
            exploit that hidden carry bit.&nbsp; But I'm having trouble
            seeing any way you might do it.&nbsp; That could just be my
            failure of imagination, of course.)<br>

            gives the syllable number within that word.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            "residual sector" cannot be accessed.<br>
            <br>
            Note, however, that the <i>assembler</i> could work around
            the limitation that the target address had to be in the same
            sector.&nbsp; The assembler would automatically insert a <tt>HOP</tt>
            instruction instead of a <tt>TRA</tt> whenever it found
            that it was necessary to do so.&nbsp; For example, consider
            the instruction "<tt>TRA ETCBTC</tt>".&nbsp; If the target
            location <tt>ETCBTC</tt> is within the current instruction
            sector, the assembler would indeed assemble this exactly as
            expected, using a <tt>TRA</tt> instruction with opcode <tt>1000</tt>.&nbsp;









































            Actually, the assembler would refuse to directly do a <tt>TRA</tt>
            to a target in the same instruction sector under some
            circumstances, presumably to help guard the programmer from
            easy-to-make errors.&nbsp; The condition I've noticed in
            which this occurs is if the target address has been tagged
            by the assembler as being in a region with a different
            setting for the <i>data</i> module or sector, since unlike
            a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction, a <tt>TRA</tt> instruction
            doesn't alter the DM/DS settings.&nbsp; Whereas if a <tt>CDS</tt>
            instruction (which changes the DM/DS settings in the
            processor itself) happens to be at the target location, it
            doesn't trigger a replacement by <tt>HOP</tt>.&nbsp; Quite
            a complicated set of conditions! One wonders if the original
            programmers actually had much awareness at the time (or
            cared!) that these substitutions were being made for them.<br>
            <br>
            But if the target location (<tt>ETCBTC</tt> in this example)
            wasn't within the current instruction sector or failed the
            DM/DS conditions, then the assembler would instead perform
            the following complicated maneuver which preserves the
            expected program logic, at the cost of an extra machine
            cycle and an extra word of memory:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Allocate a data word in the current data sector.&nbsp;
                This is done by searching upward through the current
                data sector (or the residual sector, failing that) until
                an unallocated word is found.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Create a HOP constant for the target location <tt>ETCBTC</tt>,
                and store it in the newly-allocated data word.</li>
              <li>Assemble a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction with the
                newly-allocated data word as its operand.</li>
              <li>Whenever such a substitution was performed by the
                assembler, it noted it in the assembly listing by
                replacing "<tt>TRA</tt>" with "<tt>TRA*</tt>".&nbsp;
                However, I think that "<tt>TRA</tt>" is always what
                would have originally been used on the punch card.&nbsp;
                But like <tt>HOP*</tt>, <tt>TMI*</tt>, and TNZ*,
                that's just my opinion, and we have no contemporary
                documentation to tell use one way or the other whether
                the "<tt>*</tt>" in "<tt>TRA*</tt>" was present on the
                computer punch cards or not.<br>
              </li>
              <li><i>Workaround for PTC</i>:&nbsp; For the PTC version
                of the assembler, I've unfortunately been forced to
                provide hints to the modern assembler (yaASM.py) by <i>explicitly</i>
                using "<tt>TRA*</tt>" in the source code when
                necessary.&nbsp; With either of "<tt>TRA</tt>" or "<tt>TRA*</tt>",









































                the modern assembler provides a behaviorally-correct
                fixup, but when "<tt>TRA</tt>" is used rather than "<tt>TRA*</tt>",









































                the automatically-allocated memory words are at
                different addresses than originally, thus preventing
                validation of the assembler.&nbsp; Deducing the original
                PTC algorithm and thus allowing universal use of "<tt>TRA</tt>"
                in PTC source code is a reverse-engineering problem I
                have been unable to solve so far.&nbsp; (Although, for
                all <i>I</i> know, the PTC programmers may themselves
                have had to explicitly use "<tt>TRA*</tt>" as
                well.&nbsp; There's no available original documentation
                to answer that question one way or the other.)</li>
            </ul>
            This in so far as the assembly-language source code is
            concerned, it seems that one may as well always use <tt>TRA</tt>
            rather than <tt>HOP</tt>, since <tt>TRA</tt> is more
            economical than <tt>HOP</tt>, and the assembler will always
            substitute <tt>HOP</tt> anyway whenever some limitation of
            <tt>TRA</tt> necessitates it.<br>

            <p>The LVDC and PTC cases appear to be very different, but
              the difference is really just that the PTC has no
              multiplication and division instructions, and hence has no
              product-quotient or multiplicand-divisor register.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the description of 776 and 777 above is
              admittedly a bit tricky to understand, so let's try to get
              at it another way.&nbsp; It's mainly about return
              addresses for subroutines and interrupt-service
              routines.&nbsp; Most modern CPU's have a "CALL"
              instruction for calling subroutines, and part of what CALL
              would do is to push the return address onto a dedicated
              "stack" in memory; a subsequent "RET" instruction would
              then pop the return address out of the stack and jump to
              that return address. &nbsp; But the LVDC/PTC CPU has no
              such features ... no CALL, no RET, no stack.&nbsp; What it
              does instead is this:&nbsp; During the process of
              executing any given LVDC/PTC instruction, a HOP constant
              for the LVDC instruction at the <i>next successive memory
                address</i> is formed.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the next
              instruction successively in memory is not necessarily the
              next instruction sequentially executed.&nbsp; Whatever the
              next instruction executed, the previously-generated HOP
              constant is temporarily shoved into a register called
              "HOP-saver".&nbsp; Thus if the very next instruction <i>executed</i>
              after a transfer instruction (<tt>HOP</tt>, <tt>TRA</tt>,
              <tt>TMI</tt>, or <tt>TNZ</tt>) is <tt>STO 776</tt> or <tt>STO



























































































                777</tt>, what ends up getting stored in location 776 or
              777 is the HOP constant for the memory address that
              follows the previously executed transfer instruction
              instruction in memory.&nbsp; Or in brief, for a transfer
              instruction to a subroutine, what gets saved at 776 or 777
              is the return address of the subroutine.&nbsp; In fact,
              this is the only easy method for accessing such return
              addresses, and the only way at all for accessing return
              addresses of interrupt-service routines.<br>
            </p>
            As an example, here's a simple framework for calling an
            LVDC/PTC subroutine:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ...<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                SUB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



























































































                # Call a subroutine.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
                <br>
                # The subroutine.</tt><br>

                STO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                # Save the return address.</tt><br>
              <tt> </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




























































































                # ... do stuff ...</tt><br>
              <tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt>HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



























































































                776
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                # Return from SUB.</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            <tt> </tt>This becomes trickier if you have <i>nested</i>
            subroutine calls, because the nested routines can't each use
            the same storage buffers for their return addresses, and
            there's no way to temporarily replace the contents of
            776/777 while still being able to restore the original
            contents afterward.&nbsp; (You can certainly <i>read</i>
            776/777, for example with <tt>CLA 776</tt>, but you can't
            save an arbitrary value into either 776 or 777
            afterward.)&nbsp; In other words, if you have a nested
            subroutine, you have to manage the return address of the
            parent subroutine manually.&nbsp; Here's an example I've
            constructed to illustrate the method:<br>

            You can, of course, perform the same trick with multiple
            levels of nesting, at the cost of allocating more and more
            variables to store the manually-managed return addresses.<br>
            <br>
            It is perhaps obvious as well that the same address (776 vs
            777) should not be used for interrupt-service routines and
            and for regular subroutines, even for the few instruction
            cycles needed for manual management, or else tremendous care
            needs to be taken to insure that no interrupt can occur
            during a subroutine with conflicting storage requirements
            for the return addresses.&nbsp; The safest thing would be to
            use 776 for interrupt-service routines (and their
            subroutines) and 777 for non-interrupt subroutines, or
            vice-versa.&nbsp; In examining the PTC ADAPT Self-Test
            Program and the AS206-RAM Flight Program, the two seem to
            use the opposite choice, so there may not have been a
            customary standard for doing so from one program to the
            next.<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">This is a conditional jump
            instruction, which branches to the address embedded in the
            instruction if the accumulator is less than zero, but simply
            continues to the next instruction in sequence if the
            accumulator greater than or equal to zero.&nbsp; Bits A1-A8
            of the embedded address represent the new offset within the
            currently selected 256-word instruction sector, while bit A9
            gives the syllable number within that word.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            "residual sector" cannot be accessed. <br>
            <br>
            As mentioned, the target address for the machine instruction
            itself had to be within the current sector, because its
            8-bit address offset is embedded within the
            instruction.&nbsp; However, the assembler would
            transparently work around this problem, allowing essentially
            <i>any</i> target address to be used.&nbsp; The workaround
            used by the assembler is that same as that described for the
            <tt>TNZ</tt> instruction above.&nbsp; Instructions for which
            the workaround have been applied are shown on the assembly
            listing as "<tt>TMI*</tt>" rather than "<tt>TMI</tt>".<br>
            <br>
            As with <tt>TNZ</tt><tt>*</tt>, it is is unclear whether
            the <tt>*</tt> for <tt>TMI*</tt> was present in the source
            code or not.&nbsp; It is therefore my assumption (and the
            modern LVDC assembler's assumption) that <tt>TMI</tt>
            (without <tt>*</tt>) was always used in source code, while
            the <tt>*</tt> in <tt>TMI*</tt> is only present in
            assembly listings.&nbsp; I am unaware of any evidence to the
            contrary.<br>

            By a "left" shift, we mean a shift toward the
            more-significant direction (multiplying by powers of 2); by
            a "right" shift, we mean a shift toward the less-significant
            direction (dividing by powers of 2).<br>
            <br>
            In terms of assembly-language syntax, I have never seen <tt>SHF</tt>
            itself used.&nbsp; Rather, the synonyms <tt>SHL</tt> (left
            shift) and <tt>SHR</tt> (right shift) are used, and only in
            the following variations:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>SHL <i>N</i></tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>SHR <i>N</i></tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            where <i><tt>N</tt></i> is a literal decimal numerical
            constant.&nbsp; However, <tt>N</tt> is not limited to just
            0, 1, or 2, even those are all that <tt>SHF</tt> directly
            supports.&nbsp; If an operand <i><tt>N</tt></i>&gt;2 is
            encountered, the assembler transparently replaces it with an
            appropriate <i>sequence</i> of shift-by-2 and shift-by-1
            instructions.<br>
            <br>
            Note:&nbsp; The <i>original</i> documentation of the <tt>SHF</tt>
            instruction itself does not actually describe the
            directionality of the shifts, nor the nature of the data
            used to fill the bit-positions vacated by the shift.&nbsp;
            It instead simply refers to the there-undefined terms "MSD
            shift" and "LSD shift".&nbsp; <i> Elsewhere</i> in the
            original documentation is a theory-of-operation for the
            electronic circuitry, and the additional information about
            directionality and fill-values given above is derived from
            the theory of operation.<br>

            In terms of assembly-language syntax, I have never seen <tt>SHF</tt>
            itself used.&nbsp; Rather, the synonyms <tt>SHL</tt> (left
            shift) and <tt>SHR</tt> (right shift) are used, and only in
            the following variations:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>SHL <i>N</i></tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>SHR <i>N</i></tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            where <i><tt>N</tt></i> is a literal decimal numerical
            constant.&nbsp; However, <tt>N</tt> is not limited to just
            1 through 6, even those are all that <tt>SHF</tt> directly
            supports.&nbsp; If an operand <i><tt>N</tt></i>&gt;6 is
            encountered, the assembler transparently replaces it with an
            appropriate <i>sequence</i> of shift-by-6 (or less)
            instructions.<br>
            <br>
            Note:&nbsp; The <i>original</i> documentation of the <tt>SHF</tt>
            instruction itself does not actually describe the
            directionality of the shifts, nor the nature of the data
            used to fill the bit-positions vacated by the shift.&nbsp;
            It instead simply refers to the there-undefined terms "MSD
            shift" and "LSD shift".&nbsp; <i> Elsewhere</i> in the
            original documentation is a theory-of-operation for the
            electronic circuitry, and the additional information about
            directionality and fill-values given above is derived from
            the theory of operation.<br>

            <br>
            The <tt>EXM</tt> instruction takes a target instruction
            stored at a different memory location, in the residual<i> </i>sector




            of the current <i>data</i> module — not the current <i>instruction</i>
            module, unless they happen to be the same — then forms a
            modified operand for that instruction, executes the modified
            instruction, and then continues with the next instruction
            following the <tt>EXM</tt> (unless the program counter has
            also been changed by the modified instruction).&nbsp; For
            this instruction, A8 and A9 form a part of the instruction
            code, so only A1-A7 are significant.&nbsp; <br>

                is stored.&nbsp; Personally, I think that it would be

            It is important to understand that the target instruction is
            not modified within the LVDC memory; rather, it is modified
            and executed without the modified form of it being stored in
            memory at all.<br>
            <br>
            Only 4 different choices of memory address are allowed to
            contain the target instruction which is to be modified,
            namely 0200, 0240, 0300, and 0340 in the "residual sector"
            in the memory module selected by the current DM (data
            module) register.<br>
            <br>
            Some of the bits in A1-A7 of the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction
            represent various types of modifications to the embedded
            address at the target address rather than themselves being
            address bits.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the interpretations of
            bits A1-A7 found in the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A1-A4 modify the address embedded in the target
                instruction as described below.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A5 indicates the syllable in which the target
                instruction resides in residual memory.</li>
              <li>A7,A6 selects the target address, as follows:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>0,0 for target address 0200</li>
                <li>0,1 for target address 0240</li>
                <li>1,0 for target address 0300</li>
                <li>1,1 for target address 0340</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            To modify the target instruction, its A1-A9 bits are formed
            as follows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A1-A2 come from A1-A2 of the <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">EXM</span>
                instruction.</li>
              <li>A3 is the logical OR of the A3 of the target
                instruction and A3 of the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction.</li>
              <li>A4 is the logical OR of the A4 of the target
                instruction and A4 of the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction.</li>
              <li>A5-A8 come from A5-A8 of the target instruction, and
                remain unchanged.</li>
              <li>A9 becomes 0, thus the target instruction cannot be
                either <tt>EXM</tt> or <tt>SHF/SHR/SHL</tt>.&nbsp;
                (The original documentation does not actually say
                anything about how the target instruction's A9 is
                modified, but if it were allowed to remain 1, the
                data-sector discussion which immediately follows would
                not make sense.)<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The data sector used when the target instruction is executed
            is also changed for the duration of that one instruction, as
            determined by bits A1, A2, and A9 of the unmodified target
            instruction, as follows:<br>

      Instruction)</h3>
    My understanding of this is sketchy right now, so take anything I
    have to say with a grain of salt.&nbsp; <br>
    <p>Note that the LVDC code is self-modifying, and thus ports that
      don't explicitly appear in the source code may actually be
      accessed at runtime, while ports that do explicitly appear in the
      code may be changed to something else before having a chance to be
      accessed at runtime.&nbsp; For example, on p. 227 of the AS206-RAM
      source code (look at labels <tt>MLDBUX</tt>, <tt>MLDBUY</tt>,
      and <tt>MLDBUZ</tt>), there's self-modifying code that changes an
      instruction <tt>PIO 203</tt> to a <tt>PIO 303</tt>, then changes
      it to a <tt>PIO 273</tt>, and then finally changes it back to <tt>PIO

























































































        203</tt>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with programming and
      documentation practices like these, getting a complete list of
      ports used — other than by just running the code under all
      possible combinations of conditions and recording what happens —
      is a tough proposition.&nbsp; (That's not intended as a criticism
      of the programming practices IBM FSD had back in 1967 ... but it
      goes to show why, <i>today</i>, there are reasons that practices
      such as these are frowned upon.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>At any rate, here is a table of ports from the original
      documentation, though massaged a bit by me.<br>

                            logically-OR's ACC to the latch; I presume
                            the latter.&nbsp; There are 13 interrupts

    <p>Figure 2-11 of <a href="Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf">the




























































































        original PTC documentation</a> gives a list of i/o ports
      employed by the PTC's <tt>CIO</tt> instruction.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, by my count, 137 different <tt>CIO</tt> ports are
      used just within the PAST program, while the documentation lists
      only 35 of them.&nbsp; The following is a table of <i>all</i>
      known <tt>CIO</tt> ports, including not only those listed in the
      original documentation, but also those found in the source code of
      the PAST program.&nbsp; Sometimes the functionality of a port
      referenced <i> only</i> in the PAST program is easily inferred
      from comments in the source code, so I've supplied my inferences
      in the table below, while in other cases I haven't yet deduced
      that functionality.&nbsp; In other words, as usual, this is a work
      in progress!&nbsp; Port numbers whose descriptions were pasted
      from the original documentation are in <b>bold text</b>, to
      distinguish them from those whose functionality has merely been
      inferred.<br>

            the Address Compare (ADR COMP) latch, discussed on p. V-2-69
            of the PTC documentation, so that the contents of <tt>ACC</tt>

            the other hand, this interpretation is inconsistent with the
            notion that the SIGN bit must be non-zero to enable
            comparisons, since <tt>L9P36</tt>'s HOP constant has a SIGN
            bit of 0, so perhaps more thought is required to unravel
            what this operation is doing.<br>

            The typewriter BUSY signal (see <tt>CIO 214</tt> below)
            becomes active while this operation occurs physically, and
            then becomes inactive when the operation is complete.<br>
            <br>
            For reasons which are unclear to me, <tt>CIO 120</tt>
            appears to enable various interrupts in the interrupt latch,
            with different interrupts being enabled for different
            characters.&nbsp; The same holds true for <tt>CIO 124</tt>
            and <tt>CIO 130</tt>, with the same interrupts being
            enabled for the same printable characters.&nbsp; Moreover,
            the conditions enabled by <tt>CIO 130</tt> affect still
            other interrupt bits.&nbsp; In the PAST program source code,
            the characters printed vs the interrupt bits expected to be
            set are given by a 1-to-1 relationship between the arrays <tt>CHAR</tt>
            and <tt>PATN</tt>, with the exception that <tt>PATN</tt>
            does not distinguish between "upper case" and "lower case"
            characters as described below.&nbsp; Though not mentioning
            interrupts at all, the interrupt-bit patterns <i>seem</i>
            to be derivable from Figure 2-56 of the PTC document,
            "Selection and Tilt-Rotate Schedule", in which the following
            relationship between individual BCD keyboard solenoids (or
            other conditions) and interrupt bits seems to hold
            empirically:<br>

            <p><i>Additionally,</i> some characters are categorized as
              "upper case" and others are categorized as "lower
              case".&nbsp; These distinctions aren't what you would
              expect, since the alphabetics ("A" through "Z") are all <i>lower</i>
              case.&nbsp;&nbsp; When ever a change from an upper-case
              character to a lower-case character occurs, the typewriter
              requires additional time to make this adjustment, so the
              BUSY signal remains active longer.&nbsp; Moreover, instead
              of simply changing the interrupt-latch bits in the way
              described above, a two-step process is observed:<br>
            </p>

              <li>For a change to upper case, Interrupt 1 latch is set,
                while for a change to lower case, Interrupt 2 latch is
                set.&nbsp; This condition persists for a while.</li>
              <li>After a brief delay, the remaining interrupt-latch
                bits (as described earlier) are set as well.<br>

            A carriage return also occurs automatically, without the
            need for <tt>CIO 134</tt>, if the right-hand margin is
            reached and the typewriter is not otherwise busy.<br>
            <br>
            Regarding tabs and carriage returns, realize that for an IBM
            Selectric typewriter, the tab stops and the left/right
            margins were set manually, using controls on the face of the
            typewriter.&nbsp; Fortunately, Selectric typefaces used (I
            believe!) typefaces with fixed-width characters, so the
            number of characters per tab stop or line of print did not
            vary on a line-by-line basis.&nbsp; On the other hand, there
            were two different sizes for the typefaces, 12 characters
            per inch or 10 characters per inch, so the number of
            characters per line still varied depending on the chosen
            size of the typeface.&nbsp; Given that the PAST program's
            test procedures actually do test conditions such as reaching
            the right-hand margin, one would suppose that the PTC
            documentation of the self-test procedures would give
            specific instructions regarding these various choices.&nbsp;
            One would be mistaken in this assumption.<br>
            <br>
            So in terms of emulation of the PTC's typewriter peripheral,
            there's no cut-and-dried way of knowing where the tab stops
            are, when an automatic carriage returns is supposed to occur
            due to having hit a right-hand margin, or where the print
            head is supposed to position itself after a carriage return
            does occur.&nbsp; The PAST program itself gives some hints
            as to what's expected, in that some cursory notes on p. 90
            of the source code — a routine which exercises the
            typewriter — say:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET
                RIGHT MARGIN BETWEEN 120 AND 124</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET LEFT
                MARGIN AT 0</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET TAB AT
                10</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            Unfortunately these settings (or at least the margin
            settings) are not consistent with the tests actually
            implemented in the PAST program source code.&nbsp; The
            emulated PTC panel accepts the tab-stop width and carriage
            width as command-line parameters.<br>

            command.&nbsp; The CalComp 565 plotter is a drum plotter, in
            which the paper is pinched against a cylindrical drum, and
            the pen is on a carriage that moves parallel to the axis of
            the drum.&nbsp; The Y axis is along the carriage, with the
            positive direction being to the left, and the negative
            direction to the right, while the X coordinate is around the
            circumference of the drum and is changed by the rolling of
            the drum to advance or regress the paper.<br>
            <br>
            The X value for <tt>CIO 140</tt> and Y value for <tt>CIO
              144</tt>, supplied by <tt>ACC</tt>, are not absolute
            coordinates, but are rather relative to the current position
            of the pen.&nbsp; According to the PTC documentation, the
            values for <tt>CIO 140</tt> and <tt>144</tt> can range
            from -1024 to +1024, with each step representing an offset
            of 0.01 inch.&nbsp; (Of course, in the emulated PTC, the
            distances may not be represented accurately.)&nbsp; The drum
            itself was physically 11 inches wide, thus providing a hard
            limit on the absolute Y coordinates, which I presume was 0
            to 1023.&nbsp; There is presumably no practical limit on the
            absolute X coordinates, since the paper is provided on a
            continuous roll (which can be torn off as desired) rather
            than on sheets cut to a specific length.<br>
            <br>
            The X and Y values are not in native 2's-complement format
            of the processor.&nbsp; Instead, they are encoded as <i>positive</i>
            10-bit values (in the least-significant bits of <tt>ACC</tt>,
            bits 16 through 25), while the sign is indicated the SIGN
            bit.&nbsp; All other bits (1 through 15) are 0.<br>
            <br>
            The driving circuitry for the plotter was provided by the
            PTC, and allowed only for drawing along the X or Y axes, or
            at 45° angles, thus greatly limiting the flexibility of what
            could be easily plotted.&nbsp; To draw at 45°, <tt>CIO 140</tt>
            and <tt>CIO 144</tt> instructions would be performed in
            succession, outputting values that are either identical or
            else differ only by being opposite in sign.&nbsp; The
            plotter would then be stepped by the PTC circuitry at a rate
            of 300 steps/second.&nbsp; Using other combinations of
            values (such as an X value of 100 and and a Y value of 200)
            would <i>not</i> draw a line at a different angle; rather,
            the pen would proceed at a 45° angle until either X or Y had
            been exhausted, and then would move an extra amount along
            the Y or X axis until the other had been exhausted.&nbsp;
            Thus, to draw a line at (say) 30°, rather than attempting to
            do so in one iteration, it would be necessary to do it using
            many short segments at multiples of 45°, producing a
            slightly jagged effect.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; The
            emulated PTC panel (yaPTC.py) ignores this restriction, and
            simply drives the pen in a straight line to the new
            commanded position, at whatever angle is implied.<br>
            <br>
            The original PTC documentation is not as explicit as I'd
            hope for, but it seems to imply that the initiation of the
            plotting action is controlled by <tt>CIO 144</tt>.&nbsp; In
            other words, merely loading the X value using <tt>CIO 140</tt>
            is not enough to start the physical plot; it is necessary to
            load the Y value (perhaps with 0) using <tt>CIO 144</tt>
            for the plotting to actually commence.&nbsp; This
            interpretation is consistent with the usage and the program
            comments in the PAST program source code.<br>
            <br>
            Regarding the PTC panel emulation (yaPTC.py), a separate
            window is opened to hold an image of the plot.&nbsp; The
            plot is in the same orientation as the original physical
            printer: the X-axis is vertical and the Y-axis is
            horizontal.&nbsp; By default the plot window is 1024×1024,
            plus a small margin.&nbsp; That's big enough in the Y
            direction, but not necessarily in the X direction.&nbsp;
            However, you can expand the size of the plot window by
            dragging its border.&nbsp; Or, if you have a mouse with a
            scroll wheel, you can pan the image vertically using the
            scroll wheel.&nbsp; For horizontal panning,&nbsp; depress
            the keyboard's SHIFT key while adjusting the scroll wheel.<br>

            documentation.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            For the original physical printer, there was a paper tape
            which encoded information about the paper loaded into the
            printer.&nbsp; This allowed things like automatic pagination
            without any software changes.&nbsp; The encoding of the
            carriage-control commands involved 12 "channels", each of
            which had a hole punched in the tape or did not have a hole
            punched.&nbsp; This paper-format-defining paper tape and its
            12 channels is obviously irrelevant in modern terms, and
            specifically to any emulation of the PTC, where there's no
            paper tape and probably no paper!&nbsp; Similarly, the
            physical printer had a buffer in which all incoming data was
            stored until either the buffer was full or else a "group
            mark" command had been received, at which point the buffered
            data was physically printed and the buffer was
            cleared.&nbsp; The carriage-control commands fall into two
            groups, those which are executed "immediately" — i.e.,
            presumably before the buffer is physically printed — or
            "after print".&nbsp; This buffer is not emulated, so there
            is no distinction made in the PTC emulation between the
            "immediate" and the "after print" commands.<br>
            <br>
            Here's my emulation-friendly summary of Figure 2-51, with
            all reference to the "channels" and "immediate"/"after
            print" removed.&nbsp; "X" (unlike in Figure 2-51) means
            "don't care":<br>

            As mentioned in the discussion of the <tt>PRS</tt>
            instruction earlier, using <tt>PRS</tt> to send character
            data to the printer has the side effect of altering the
            interrupt latch, thus potentially causing interrupts, or of
            allowing readback (using <tt>CIO 154</tt>) of those changes
            to the interrupt latch.&nbsp; This is entirely undocumented
            (unless it can be figured out from the 2nd-level
            schematics), as far as I can tell, but fortunately the PAST
            source code has a complete list of the bit patterns produced
            vs the data for <tt>CIO 160</tt> that produce them.&nbsp;
            Refer to the arrays <tt>PATN2</tt> and <tt>PATN3</tt> in
            that source code.&nbsp; Rather than reproduce that list
            here, I'll instead give you a rule that I infer from them,
            which is helpful in understanding the <tt>PRS</tt>

            <ul>
              <li>Bits SIGN, 1-5:&nbsp; These are identical to the upper
                6 bits of <tt>CIO 160</tt>'s data word.</li>
              <li>Bit 6:&nbsp; Odd-parity bit.&nbsp; (I.e., a bit chosen
                to insure that the contents of the entire interrupt
                latch has odd parity.)<br>

            haven't yet determined how to reconcile the various uses,
            which aren't necessarily self-consistent — it's hard to
            tell! — but here's a summary of what the code seems to say::<br>

                physical page has been reached and that the printer
                should therefore advance to "channel 1" of the next
                page.&nbsp; This will also cause the printer's BUSY

                causes the interrupt latch (read by <tt>CIO 154</tt>)
                to be loaded with a specific pattern of bits, similar to

            the PAST program uses certain toggles in a systematic way,
            and those are indicated below.<br>
            <br>
            In contrast, the GATED toggles are read as 1 when ON, but
            when OFF allow the CPU to instead read the indicated signals
            generated elsewhere in the PTC, which could each be either 0
            or 1 at any given time.&nbsp; <br>

            fail).&nbsp; I think this may output a value to a 26-bit
            shift register that subsequently shifts the data left at a
            rate of one bit per machine cycle.&nbsp; In the original PTC
            hardware, the shift register may be used to serialize data
            for display on the PTC front panel, when the DISPLAY SELECT

            <br>

            possibly be read back with a <tt>CIO 001</tt> instruction

                (This comment appears in a block of code which is
                commented as <tt>TEST CHECK BIT FOR 10,11,12 TIME OCTAL

            to activate discrete outputs 1, 2, and 3 in the course of
            printer-peripheral operations, at which point those discrete

              guess is that <tt>CIO 264</tt> latches these values into
              a separate set of flip-flops, which are then used by the
              PTC hardware to simulate that printer parity errors have
              occurred.&nbsp; Such errors would otherwise be impossible
              to simulate in software and would require physical
              modifications to the printer electronics.&nbsp; The effect
              I see (in the PAST program) is that certain bits in the
              interrupt latch are set after a subsequent <tt>PRS</tt>
              instruction.&nbsp; In other words, one latches the desired
              bits using <tt>CIO 264</tt>, performs a <tt>PRS</tt> to
              print, then reads back the interrupt latch with <tt>CIO
                154</tt>, and tests bits read back from the interrupt
              latch to verify that they indicate the proper printer
              error.&nbsp; I have no rationale for the specific bits
              that are set, other than that I have observed them
              empirically.&nbsp; Indeed, they seem rather arbitrary, and
              I don't intend to specifically document them here.&nbsp;
              Moreover, once a particular self test has been initiated —
              test routine 5 is the specific test in which <tt>CIO 264</tt>
              occurs — the PAST program then runs the test repeatedly
              until manually canceled, and yet does nothing to reset the
              contents of <tt>CIO 264</tt> for test runs subsequent to
              the first run, as far as I can see.&nbsp; And yet they <i>must</i>
              be reset, or else all subsequent tests would fail due to
              the contents of the <tt>CIO 264</tt> latch being
              unexpected.&nbsp; The emulation handles this by resetting
              those latched bits every time the printer's mode is
              changed from BCD to octal or vice-versa.<br>
            </p>
            <p>It's easy to see that this behavior I've described is a
              particularly weak aspect of the PTC emulation, likely to
              exist only in my imagination rather than correspondending
              to what the original hardware did.&nbsp; I hope the
              question may eventually be resolved by analysis of the PTC
              electrical schematics.<br>

      Linkage</h3>
    While the LVDC is executing an instruction, it is also forming the
    HOP constant of the next instruction in sequence—i.e., on the
    assumption that no branch occurs—and this HOP constant is available
    to the next instruction that executes.&nbsp; In most cases, this
    means that an instruction can find out its own address (which isn't
    very interesting), but if the previous instruction was a branch then
    it means that the current instruction can determine the address of
    the instruction in sequence that followed the branch instruction,
    and thus can use this information for setting up returns from
    subroutines.&nbsp; The instruction for fetching that HOP constant
    and saving it is either <span style="font-family: courier

    <h3><a name="Interrupts" id="Interrupts"></a>Interrupts</h3>
    <h4><a name="Interrupts_of_LVDC"></a>Interrupts of LVDC</h4>
    There are up to 12 external interrupt sources, buffered by the
    LVDA.&nbsp; Upon any of these becoming active, the LVDA generates a
    master interrupt signal to the LVDC.&nbsp; When the LVDC receives
    the master interrupt signal, assuming that interrupts have not been
    programmatically inhibited, the following actions occur:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The LVDC automatically masks that particular interrupt from
        occurring again until explicitly reenabled (at step 9 below).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The LVDC allows any instruction, multiplication, or division
        in progress to complete.</li>
      <li>The LVDC performs a <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0400</span>, thus transferring
        control to an interrupt-service routine—or, as the original
        documents refer to it, an "input-output subprogram".&nbsp;
        Recall that this does not jump to address 0400, rather it loads
        the HOP Register from the value stored at address 0400, and this
        can be used to jump to a location, set the current memory module
        and sector, etc.&nbsp; (Early non-flight hardware seemingly used
        a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP
          0776</span> instead of <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0400</span>.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>
        instruction executed by the interrupt service routine must be
        either <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0777</span>
        to store the pre-interrupt value of the HOP Register at either
        address 0776 or 0777.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should then save any registers
        or common memory locations that were going to be altered into
        local storage.&nbsp; In almost all cases, one would suppose that
        the accumulator needed to be stored.&nbsp; If multiplications or
        divisions would be used, the P-Q Register would also need to be
        saved, presumably with a pair of instructions like <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLA 0775</span>
        followed by <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span></span>.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should do a <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span>
        from the Interrupt Storage input port to determine which of the
        12 interrupt sources are active, so that it can vector to an
        appropriate service routine for it.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should then do whatever
        computations it needed to do.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should restore the registers it
        had saved (<span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">CLA <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span></span>
        followed by <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0775</span> to restore the P-Q
        Register, if necessary, followed by a restoration of the
        accumulator).</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should do a <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span>
        to the Interrupt Register Reset output port, with just the
        specific bit set corresponding to the interrupt type being
        processed, to reenable that specific interrupt.&nbsp; The
        particular flavor of <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span> performed should, of
        course, take the Data Source from memory rather than from the
        accumulator, since at this point the accumulator has already
        been restored to its pre-interrupt condition.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The return from interrupt is either <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0777</span>,
        depending on which location the HOP constant had been stored on
        entry to the interrupt service routine.</li>
    </ol>
    Interrupts can be programmatically masked or unmasked with <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span> to
    Interrupt Inhibit.&nbsp; By setting a bit in Interrupt Inhibit
    corresponding to the interrupt whose masking is desired, that
    interrupt is thereby masked.&nbsp; Any combination of bits can be
    set, so any combination of interrupts can be masked.&nbsp; To
    reenable the interrupt, a 0 is written to the corresponding bit in
    Interrupt Inhibit.<br>
    <br>
    <i><b>Note:</b></i><i>&nbsp; The table below is temporarily struck
      out, because when I created it I somehow confused interrupt
      priorities with bit positions in associated control
      registers.&nbsp; I've crossed it out until I can reevaluate and
      replace it with the correct information.</i><br>
    <br>
    <strike>The available interrupts, and their bitwise positioning in
      the i/o registers mentioned above, differed for the Saturn IB
      rocket (Apollo 7, ASTP, Skylab) vs. the Saturn V rocket (Apollo
      8-17).&nbsp; The Saturn IB and Saturn V descriptions below were
      taken from different documents (namely, </strike><strike><a

      respectively), and if one accounts for the differences in language

              The following is partly speculation, so take it with a
              grain of salt: I believe that this interrupt may occur
              when a special uplink command ("Terminate") is
              received.&nbsp; The purpose of the "Terminate" command is
              to halt an operation from a previously uplinked command
              (see above) and to return the LVDC flight program to
              normal operation.&nbsp; Since the "command LVDA/RCA-110A"
              interrupt would be disabled until that processing is
              completed, a separate interrupt for the "Terminate"
              command is needed, and that is the "Program re-cycle"
              interrupt.</strike><strike><br>

              catastrophic in the real world of the rocket, and
              therefore very permanent.&nbsp; I have been told that the
              LVDC programmers called this the "Tough Luck Charlie"
              interrupt, and indeed there is a reference to this in the
              LVDC source code.</strike><strike><br>

    <h4><a name="Interrupts_of_PTC"></a>Interrupts of PTC</h4>
    <p>There are up to 16 external interrupt sources for the PTC.&nbsp;
      Interrupts of the first 15 types are generated by the circuitry of
      the PTC that corresponds to an LVDA, and is latched in the LVDA,
      whereas the 16th type is generated by a pushbutton ("I16") on the
      PTC control panel.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When one of these interrupts occurs, assuming that interrupts
      have not been inhibited, the following actions occur:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The PTC allows any instruction in progress to complete.</li>
      <li>The PTC masks further interrupts, until explicitly reenabled
        (either programmatically at step 8 below, or else by switches on
        the PTC control panel).</li>
      <li>The PTC performs a <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span> using one of the
        HOP-constants stored at addresses 0400 through 0417 (locations 0
        through 017 of module 0 sector 017), depending on the source of
        the interrupt, thus transferring control to an interrupt-service
        routine appropriate to the interrupt source.&nbsp; Recall that
        this does not jump <i>to</i> one of these addresses, rather it
        loads the HOP Register from the value stored at the address,
        which has the effect of jumping to the location described by the
        HOP constant, setting the current memory module and sector,
        etc.&nbsp; Thus an interrupt of type 1 basically executes a <font
          face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">HOP 401</font>, an
        interrupt of type 2 executes a <font face="Courier New,
          Courier, monospace">HOP 402</font>, etc.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>
        instruction executed by the interrupt service routine must be
        either <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0777</span>
        to store the pre-interrupt value of the HOP Register at either
        address 0776 or 0777.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine must then immediately save any
        registers or common memory locations that were going to be
        altered into local storage.&nbsp; In almost all cases, one would
        suppose that the accumulator needed to be stored.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should then do whatever
        computations it needed to do.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should restore the registers.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should perform the appropriate <tt>CIO</tt>
        instruction(s) for reenabling the masked interrupts.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The return from interrupt is either <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0777</span>,
        depending on which location the HOP constant had been stored on
        entry to the interrupt service routine.</li>
    </ol>
    In the PAST program specifically, space for the HOP constants of the
    first 15 interrupt vectors is allocated but no constant values are
    assigned at assembly time.&nbsp; The HOP constants are instead
    assigned dynamically later under program control as part of the
    self-testing process.&nbsp; On the other hand, the 16th vector
    (manual interrupt 16) is always processed at label <tt>L17P2</tt>
    in the source code.<br>
    <br>
    The available interrupts are:<br>
    <br>
    TBD<br>
    <h3><a name="Telemetry" id="Telemetry"></a>Telemetry</h3>
    Output telemetry from the Instrumentation Unit transmitted to
    mission control can be sourced from either the LVDC or the
    LVDA.&nbsp; The LVDA spontaneously outputs telemetry on its own
    accord only when an error indication appears in its error-monitor
    register.&nbsp; The normal telemetry case, however, is that the LVDC
    initiates output telemetry by sending data to the LVDA via a <tt>PIO</tt>
    CPU instruction, and then the LVDA handles subsequent details of
    actually transmitting the data.&nbsp; In both cases, the output is
    in the form of 10-bit arrays, though the output packet logically
    consists of 4 such successive 10-bit arrays: i.e., of 40 bits.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    However, the specifics differ depend somewhat on the source.&nbsp;
    We'll confine our description to data sourced by the LVDC.&nbsp; As
    mentioned above, telemetering an output 40-bit packet from the
    LVDC's perspective is done by means of the CPU's <tt>PIO</tt>
    instruction, for which <a
      href="LVDC.html#IO_Ports_For_PIO_Instruction">a variety of i/o
      addresses are reserved for telemetry operations</a>.&nbsp; Of the
    40 bits:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>26 bits are the data payload.&nbsp; These bits come directly
        from the operand of the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction.</li>
      <li>9 bits are a tag indicating the specify type of data in the
        packet.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Bit A9: TBD</li>
        <li>Bit A8: 1.&nbsp; (1 for telemetry requested by the LVDC, and
          0 for the LVDA.)</li>
        <li>Bits A7-A1.&nbsp; These apparently come from the i/o address
          in the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the
          instructions <tt>CLA =67 / PIO 040</tt> would end up setting
          A7-A1 of the tag to 040 (octal), while the data payload would
          be set to 67 (decimal).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>3 bits determine the "mode".&nbsp; I'm not sure where these
        bits come from, but perhaps they come from the mode register,
        which the LVDC software sets via <tt>PIO 006</tt>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>1 bit indicates validity of the packet.&nbsp; The value of the
        bit is 0 if valid and 1 if invalid, and is present because the
        LVDC <tt>PIO</tt> operation can clobber an output already in
        progress, due to lack of synchronization between the LVDC and
        LVDA.&nbsp; At any rate, this bit is manipulated by the LVDA,
        and is transparent to the LVDC.<br>
      </li>
      <li>1 bit is parity.&nbsp; The overall parity of the 40-bit packet
        is odd.&nbsp; The parity bit is generated by the LVDA, and is
        transparent to the LVDC.</li>
    </ul>
    Different documentation differs in describing the arrangement of
    these various bits within the 40-bit packet, and does not fully
    explain the transmission order of the bits, so I'll refrain from
    discussing that topic here.<br>
    <br>
    A 40-bit packet requires 4.17 milliseconds to transmit, and thus the
    LVDC needs to space out its telemetry requests by at least this
    amount of time, or else subsequent telemetry request it outputs to
    the LVDA will overwrite and destroy prior requests.<br>
    <br>
    As far as the numerical specifics of the tag values used in the
    40-bit packets, this is TBD.<br>
    <h3><a name="Up-data"></a>Up-data</h3>
    <p>(A lot of information in this section is abstracted from the <a
        href="Documents/AstrionicsSystemsHandbook_Nov69.pdf">Astrionics
        System Handbook</a>, chapter 6, "Radio Command Systems".)<br>
    </p>
    <p>The term <i>up-data</i> refers to commands transmitted from
      mission control to the LVDC/LVDA.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As transmitted, the standard command-word format consists of 35
      bits:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 bits are referred to as the "X" bits.&nbsp; They form an
        address, indicating which vehicle the message is intended for. <br>
      </li>
      <li>14 bits are also an address, but they identify a specific
        "command decoder" for processing the message.&nbsp; A vehicle
        may have multiple command decoders with different hard-coded
        addresses.<br>
      </li>
      <li>18 bits comprise the control and data portions of the message.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The latter two sets of bits are interspersed within the message,
      and thus are not transmitted in the specific order shown above.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="upDataLVDC.png" width="923"
        height="501"></div>
    <p>However, the as-transmitted format of the data isn't really very
      relevant to how the LVDC and its software relate to the up-data,
      since only a portion of the transmitted bits reach the LVDC
      software — specifically only some of the bits from the final group
      of 18 — and even then they don't always reach the LVDC in the
      exact form they are transmitted.&nbsp; Thus, let's narrow our
      discussion of the up-data to just the LVDC's perspective.&nbsp;
      The 18 control&amp;data bits of the message are further
      categorized as:<br>
    </p>
    2 "OM/D" or&nbsp;<i>orbital mode/data</i> (OM/D) bits.&nbsp; (These
    are depicted in the image above, presumably mistakenly, as <b>D</b>M/D


























































































































    bits.)&nbsp; The LVDA combines this pair of bits (in some manner
    unknown to me), and thus the LVDC receives a single OM/D bit.&nbsp;
    The LVDC recognizes two types of commands, <i>mode commands words</i>
    and <i>data command words</i>, and the type of the command word is
    determined by the OM/D bits. &nbsp; <br>
    <p>Similarly, there are two transmitted "interrupt bits" (see the
      image above).&nbsp; These cause an interrupt to occur in the LVDC,
      which I believe is designated in <a href="#Interrupts">the
        interrupt table given earlier as bit-position 4</a>, Command
      Receiver Interrupt.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the 14 remaining bits actually represent just 7 bits of
      actual information, since each bit appears both in its normal form
      and in its logically-complemented form for the purpose of
      error-detection. <br>
    </p>
    <p><img alt="" src="commandWordFormat.png" width="363" height="411"
        align="right">Refer to section 6.2 of <a
        href="Documents/AstrionicsSystemsHandbook_Nov69.pdf">the
        Astrionics System Handbook</a> for more detail, but the LVDC
      software accesses the received command using the following general
      steps:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do unrelated processing until the Command Receiver interrupt
        occurs. </li>
      <li>Interrogate the OM/D bit of <tt>PIO 057</tt> to verify that
        its value is 1.&nbsp; This means that the received word is a
        "mode command word".&nbsp; (The first word of any sequence of
        commands will be a mode command word, followed by some number of
        "data command words".)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Interrogate <tt>PIO 043</tt> to get the value of the mode
        word, and parses it to determine the specific command that has
        been requested.&nbsp; Each command type will imply the number of
        data command words that will be subsequently transmitted and
        processed.&nbsp; For the sake of discussion, let's call that
        number <i>N</i>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Outputs telemetry (TBD) indicating successful reception of a
        command word.</li>
      <li>For each of the <i>N</i> data command words that are supposed
        to be received for this sequence, do the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Do unrelated processing until the Command Receiver interrupt
          occurs.</li>
        <li>Interrogate the OM/D bit of <tt>PIO 057</tt> to verify that
          its value is 0.&nbsp; I.e., that the received word is a data
          command word.</li>
        <li>Get the received word using <tt>PIO 043</tt>.</li>
        <li>Buffer the received word in memory.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After all of the <i>N</i> data words are received, perform
        whatever action is appropriate for the now-completely-received
        command.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The command word read using <tt>PIO 043</tt> has the format
      shown in the illustration to the right.&nbsp; As mentioned above,
      there are 7 actual data bits, but they appear twice each:&nbsp;
      Once "normally", and once inverted.&nbsp; Besides that, there is a
      "sequence bit" which also appears normally (bit 8) and inverted
      (bit 1).&nbsp; This bet helps to make sure the command words have
      been received in an appropriate order.&nbsp; The sequence bit is 0
      for the mode command word, then 1 for the first data command word
      (if any), and then it just toggles between 0 and 1 for each
      subsequent data command word received.&nbsp; When the next mode
      command word is received, the sequence bit goes back to 0 and the
      pattern repeats.<br>

      Language</h2>
    Unfortunately, there is no surviving manual or other reference
    describing the syntax of LVDC assembly language, nor the pseudo-ops
    available in it, nor any source code for the original LVDC
    assembler.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    This section is a compilation of my own inferences about those
    things from evaluating the available LVDC source code and from
    writing my own LVDC assembler, and then subsequently updating for
    PTC source code that was acquired later.&nbsp; The description is
    intended to be authoritative only in the sense that it describes how
    my own assembler (<a href="#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">yaASM.py</a>),































































































































    which does produce an assembled core-rope image identical to that of
    the original assembler, handles the code.&nbsp; However, my
    description shouldn't be taken as authoritative in any larger
    sense.&nbsp; For example, when I say below that the assembler has an
    initial "preprocessor pass" that performs certain processing, I mean
    that yaASM.py has such a pass; I <i>imagine</i> that the original
    assembler did as well, but cannot guarantee it.<br>
    <br>
    You'll probably need to refer to the previous <a
      href="#CPU_Instructions">discussion of the CPU instructions</a>
    from time to time, in order to follow the discussion.<br>
    <h3><a name="Basic_Factoids"></a> Basic Factoids</h3>
    <i>Empty lines</i>:&nbsp; Are ignored by the assembler.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Code comments (original Project Apollo)</i>:&nbsp; Full-line
    comments seem to be prefixed by the character '*' in column 1.&nbsp;
    Anything left over at the end of a line after the beginning of a
    line has been correctly parsed seems to be treated as a comment, and
    doesn't require any '*' prefix.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Code comments (modern Virtual AGC Project)</i>:&nbsp; Comments <i>I've</i>

    full-line comments but with a '#' character in column 1.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Character set</i>:&nbsp; Upper-case alphabetic, numeric, and some
    punctuation.&nbsp; This isn't really any great surprise, of course,
    if you reflect that all of the source code was supplied on computer
    punch cards to the IBM/360 mainframe computer which ran the
    assembler program, and that the character sets supported by keypunch
    machines did not include lower-case characters anyway.&nbsp; Douglas
    Jones has written a fun <a
      href="http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/%7Ejones/cards/index.html">exploration










































































































































































      of punch cards</a>, if you're interested in that kind of
    thing.&nbsp; (By the way, I've heard anecdotally that the executable
    program which was output by the assembly of the LVDC software was
    punched into a long mylar tape, perhaps 1.5" wide, which was then
    transported by the coders themselves to Marshall Space Flight
    Center, where the mylar tape was put into a tape reader which
    transferred the program into the ferrite-core memory of the LVDC
    itself.&nbsp; This was possible because, as you may recall from
    above, all of the ferrite cores in the LVDC were both readable <i>and</i>
    writable.&nbsp; This contrasts to the AGC, in which the program was
    stored in read-only memory which had to be <i>manufactured</i>
    rather than simply written to.&nbsp; So installing the software in
    the LVDC was a far less painful, less expensive, much quicker
    process than installing software in the AGC.&nbsp; In the case of
    the AS-206RAM program listing, the assembler helpfully reports that
    the punch tape is 432 feet long.)<br>
    <br>
    <i>Symbols</i> (names of variables, constants, subroutines,
    ...):&nbsp; 6 characters or less, alphanumeric, with the leading
    character alphabetic.&nbsp; They may also contain the character ".",
    though not in the leading position.<br>
    <i><br>
      Literal numerical constants</i>:&nbsp; Decimal literals are as you
    might expect from working with AGC code.&nbsp; They are just regular
    decimal numbers, possibly with a suffixed exponent "<tt>E</tt><tt><i>n</i></tt>"
    for powers of 10, or a suffixed "<tt>B<i>n</i></tt>" for binary
    scaling, or both.&nbsp; Suffixed exponents and scales, if both are
    present, can be in either order.<br>
    <br>
    As far as octal literals are concerned, some contexts (such as the <tt>OCT</tt>
    pseudo-op or the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction) specifically require
    them, in which case there's no special syntax to distinguish them
    from decimal numbers, other than the fact that they're not
    associated with the digits '8' or '9', with decimal points, nor with
    exponents.&nbsp; In some usages there is ambiguity, which case the
    octal literal is prefixed by 'O' (upper-case alphabetical character,
    <i>not</i> a zero).<br>
    <br>
    Regarding conversion of literal numerical constants to bit patterns
    actually stored within 26-bit memory words, there seem to be three
    basic patterns:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Pure octal constants are <i>left</i>-aligned in their memory
        word.&nbsp; In other words, a constant of <i>N</i> octal digits
        would be right-padded by 26-<i>3N</i> bits of 0.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Pure decimal (integer) constants are fully <i>right</i>-aligned.&nbsp;






























































































































        In other words, a decimal integer encoded as <i>N</i> bits
        would be sign-extended on the left by 26-<i>N</i> bits.</li>
      <li>Decimal non-integer constants are treated as being in the
        range -1.0 &lt; <i>constant</i> &lt; 1.0.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i><a name="AngleUnits"></a>Units of angular measurement</i>:&nbsp;




























































































































      For most internal purposes, the source code typically measures
      angles in a unit called a <i>pirad</i>.&nbsp; I can find no
      reference to any unit by this name outside of the LVDC source
      code, nor does the LVDC source code choose to define it in the
      program comments.&nbsp; However, from the usage, it seems pretty
      clear that<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>1 pirad = 180° = <font face="Times New Roman, Times,
        serif">π</font> radians<br>
    </blockquote>
    And then there are <i>ladder units</i>.&nbsp; They are undefined,
    of course, but I suspect this is the form required for outputting
    angular commands to external hardware:<br>
    <blockquote>1° = 1/0.06 ladder units<br>
    </blockquote>
    There are also references to angles measured in <i>2016 fine units</i>,
    again undefined.&nbsp; Apparently, the "fine" refers to "fine
    resolvers", and thus is likely the form in which the angular data is
    delivered to the LVDC from the resolvers.&nbsp; At any rate, it
    appears that<br>
    <blockquote>1° = 2016/5.625 fine units<br>
    </blockquote>
    Finally, there are references to <i>backup units</i>, which are
    (you guessed it!) undefined.&nbsp; It appears that<br>
    <blockquote>1° = 2016/180 backup units<br>
    </blockquote>
    <i>Units of time</i>:&nbsp; The source code sometimes refers to a
    unit of time measurement it calls <i>qms</i>, but does not
    define.&nbsp; I suspect this is the unit of measurement in which the
    real-time clock delivers data to the LVDC.&nbsp; Apparently,<br>
    <blockquote>1 ms = 1/0.24609375 qms<br>
      1 ms ≈&nbsp; 4.063492 qms<br>
    </blockquote>
    In other words, "qms" probably stands for "quarter millisecond".<br>

        came directly from the original punch cards.&nbsp; As a

        increasing order from one line to the next ... almost always,
        the sequence numbers increment by 10 from one line to the
        next.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are chunks of code having no
        sequence numbers at all.&nbsp; When that happens, the assembler

        assigns that same number to all subsequent lines until

        (I'm <i>not</i> saying it increments the sequence number by 10

    <h3><a name="Preprocessor_Pass"></a>Preprocessor Pass</h3>
    <p>The LVDC assembler is a macro assembler, meaning that the
      language it processes has a variety of constructs intended to make
      coding easier and more manageable but which aren't directly
      related to the internal characteristics of the LVDC CPU.&nbsp;
      These constructs are all resolved and removed from the code by a
      dedicated preprocessor pass prior to any assembly of actual LVDC
      instructions or allocation of LVDC memory.&nbsp; The various
      preprocessor constructs that appear in LVDC code are described in
      this section.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The preprocessor itself operates in a single pass, and therefore
      any symbols or macros it uses must have been defined prior in the
      source code to such use.&nbsp; I don't think that any of the
      features mentioned in this section are used the PTC source code
      available to us, so it's possible that the early versions of the
      assembler used for PTC didn't have a preprocessor at all.<br>
    </p>
    <i>The </i><i><tt>CALL</tt></i><i> macro</i>:&nbsp; <tt>CALL</tt>
    is a macro hard-coded into the assembler itself.&nbsp; By a "macro",
    I mean that superficially it is used in source code as if it were a
    CPU instruction, but it is not a CPU instruction.&nbsp; Rather, it
    is a shorthand for a sequence of several CPU instructions.&nbsp; A
    single <tt>CALL</tt> is expanded by the preprocessor into the
    appropriate stream of true CPU instructions.&nbsp; When I say it is
    "hard-coded" into the assembler, I mean that the language also
    includes ways for the programmer to define his own custom macros
    within the LVDC program if he wants, but that there are no such
    definitions for the <tt>CALL</tt> macro in the LVDC source code.<br>
    <br>
    It is probably hard-coded in the assembler rather than having a soft
    definition within the source code because there are two distinct
    variations of it.:&nbsp; There are both 2-argument and 3-argument
    variants of the macro.&nbsp; The 2-argument version is used for
    calling a subroutine having a single input argument.&nbsp; The macro
    is invoked by a source-code line of the form<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CALL <i>ARG1</i>,<i>ARG2</i></tt> <br>
    </blockquote>
    which the preprocessor replaces by a pair of actual instructions, <br>
    <blockquote><tt>CLA <i>ARG2</i></tt><br>
      <tt>HOP <i>ARG1<br>
        </i></tt></blockquote>
    All three lines appear in assembly listings, but the <tt>CALL</tt>
    is treated as a comment and the other two have a '+' character
    printed next to them to show that they're there due to the expansion
    of the macro. <br>
    <br>
    The 3-argument version,<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CALL <i>ARG1,ARG2,ARG3</i></tt> <br>
    </blockquote>
    instead expands as<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CLA ARG3<br>
        STO 775<br>
        CLA ARG2<br>
        HOP ARG1<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    and thus calls a subroutine with two input arguments.<br>
    <br>
    <i>General macro-definition facility</i>:&nbsp; As I said above, the
    macro facility is general-purpose, and custom macros can also be
    defined within the source code.&nbsp; The syntax used for defining a
    macro is as follows:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><i>NAME</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        MACRO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARG1,ARG2,...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... code using the symbols
        ARG1, ARG2, and so on ...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMAC<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    Once defined, <i><tt>NAME</tt></i> can be used to invoke the
    associated macro.<br>
    <br>
    Note that in the <i>definition</i> of the macro, the strings <tt>ARG1</tt>,
    <tt>ARG2</tt>, and so on are the list of formal arguments to the
    macro.&nbsp; Most existing LVDC code literally uses the formal
    arguments <tt>ARG1</tt>,<tt>ARG2</tt>,..., but not always.&nbsp; At
    least in the modern assembler, you can use anything as a formal
    argument that doesn't have a space or a comment in it.&nbsp; When
    you invoke the macro, the invocation will itself have a list of
    parameters (again, the parameters can be anything not having a space
    or comma in it), and the macro-expansion process will substitute
    those parameters for the formal arguments.<br>
    <br>
    As an example, consider the 2-argument the <tt> CALL</tt> macro
    described earlier.&nbsp; It is hard-coded into the assembler, and
    therefore doesn't require a definition in the code, but if it
    weren't hard-coded it could have been giving the following soft
    definition:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CALL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MACRO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        ARG1,ARG2<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp; ARG2<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARG1<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMAC<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    This might be invoked, for example, as<br>
    <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        CALL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MYFUNC,X</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    and would be expanded as<br>
    <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; X</tt><br>
      <tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MYFUNC</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    <tt> </tt>Various features commonly used with macros (and described
    below in the section on pseudo-ops) are <tt>IF/ENDIF</tt>, <tt>UNLIST/LIST</tt>,
    <tt>EQU</tt>/<tt>REQ</tt>, and <tt>SPACE</tt>.&nbsp; One feature
    not discussed later that can be used in macro definitions is the
    counter string, <tt>&amp;C1</tt>.&nbsp; This is a 3-decimal-digit
    counter that begins with a value of 000, and increments at the end
    of any macro which happens to use <tt>&amp;C1</tt>.&nbsp; In other
    words, within the first macro expansion using <tt>&amp;C1</tt>, it
    has the value 000, within the next such expanded macro it has the
    value 001, and so on.&nbsp; It can be used to create and reference
    labels which are good within any given macro expansion, but which
    don't overlap with any other macro expansion.&nbsp; The sample macro
    above doesn't use <tt>&amp;C1</tt>, so expanding that macro
    wouldn't increment the counter.&nbsp; But suppose instead that the
    macro definition were written as:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CALL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MACRO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        ARG1,ARG2<br>
        CAL&amp;C1&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ARG2<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARG1<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMAC<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    If (say) this version of <tt>CALL</tt> were the the 7th, 9th, and
    12th macro expansions actually using <tt>&amp;C1</tt>, then the
    label for the <tt>CLA</tt> instruction would be <tt>CAL006</tt>, <tt>CAL008</tt>,
    and <tt>CAL011</tt> for the respective expansions.&nbsp; If <tt>&amp;C1</tt>
    were used multiple times within the same expansion, it would have
    the same value every time; it only differs within different
    expansions.&nbsp; The naming of <tt>&amp;C1</tt> would seem to
    imply that there may be multiple counters of this type (such as <tt>&amp;C2</tt>,
    <tt>&amp;C3</tt>, and so on), but I've not seen them in actual LVDC
    code and can't imagine any use for them, so the modern assembler
    supports only <tt>&amp;C1</tt>.&nbsp; In AS-512 and AS-513 LVDC
    code, the root name for program labels local to the macros is often
    <tt>D.L</tt>, rather than the root <tt>CAL</tt> I used above in the
    sample macro, so that many macro definitions appear to have program
    label named <tt>D.L&amp;C1</tt>, which thus expand to <tt>D.L000</tt>,
    <tt>D.L001</tt>, <tt>D.L002</tt>, and so on.<br>

          IBM 360 Basic Assembly Language (BAL)</a>, there was a "system
        variable" called <tt>&amp;SYSNDX</tt>, the "macro instruction
        index", that corresponds pretty closely to our <tt>&amp;C1</tt>.&nbsp;









































        Admittedly, IBM-FSD LVDC assembly language is not IBM 360 BAL,
        but I imagine that the original LVDC assembler was likely
        written by people who had helped write the BAL assembler.&nbsp;
        Even if not, they would have been very familiar with BAL, and it
        seems to me that they would have mimicked BAL's features when it
        was appropriate to do so, rather than rethinking them
        unnecessarily.<br>
        <br>
        Some differences were that <tt>&amp;SYSNDX</tt> incremented for
        <i>each</i> expanded macro rather than just for the ones using </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>&amp;SYSNDX</tt></font><font size="-1">, and that
        it provided 4 digits rather than just 3. As it happens, there
        are more than 1000 total macro expansions in AS-512 source code,
        so if </font><font size="-1"><tt>&amp;C1</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> <i>were</i> to increment with each macro expansion
        like </font><font size="-1"><tt>&amp;SYSNDX</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, it would in fact need 4 digits.&nbsp; But
        considering the fact that symbols in LVDC assembly language are
        only 6 characters long (vs the 8+ characters in IBM 360 BAL),
        devoting 4 characters to </font><font size="-1"><tt>&amp;C1</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> could be an inconvenient naming limitation.&nbsp;
        Whereas because </font><font size="-1"><tt>&amp;C1</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> only increments when needed, it only reaches 128 in
        AS-512, comfortably within 3 digits.&nbsp; This is perhaps the
        reason that LVDC assembly language has </font><font size="-1"><tt>&amp;C1</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> (with its attendant properties) rather than sticking
        with the pre-existing </font><font size="-1"><tt>&amp;SYSNDX</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> (with its).<br>
      </font></blockquote>
    It is unclear whether macros can be nested.&nbsp; There are no cases
    of nested macros in any currently-available LVDC code.<i><br>
    </i>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b> In the afore-mentioned IBM
        BAL, macros could indeed be nested, which hints that the LVDC
        assembler may have been able to nest them as well.&nbsp; The
        modern LVDC assembler supports nested macros too, though at this
        writing macro-nesting is an untested feature.</font><i><br>
      </i></blockquote>
    <i>Pseudo variables</i>:&nbsp; "Pseudo variables" are named numeric
    constants known only by the preprocessor.&nbsp; Any usages of such
    pseudo variables are replaced by numeric literals by the
    preprocessor, and thus none of them remain in the code by the time
    the actual assembly process begins.&nbsp; This implies that the
    namespace for pseudo variables is distinct from that for left-hand
    symbols in general, so a pseudo variable can have the same name as a
    block of code or a data variable in memory without overlap.<br>
    <br>
    Pseudo variables are <i>defined</i> by the EQU pseudo-op, with a
    syntax like the following:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><i>NAME</i></tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (</tt><tt><i>EXPRESSION</i></tt><tt>)</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    In the operand here, the parentheses are literal and must always be
    present.&nbsp; <tt><i>EXPRESSION</i></tt> is an arithmetical
    expression involving numeric literals, arithmetical operators ("+",
    "-", "*", "/", and "**"), parentheses, and other
    (previously-defined) pseudo variables.&nbsp; For example,<br>
    <blockquote><tt>OMEGA&nbsp;&nbsp; EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (.72921141E-4)</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>RWCP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (OMEGA*6373377*.87993)</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    In general, parenthesized expressions involving pseudo-variables
    like this can appear anywhere in LVDC source code, and is replaced
    by the preprocessor with the numeric literals.&nbsp; Except for
    appearing as left-hand symbols in <tt>EQU</tt> statements, pseudo
    variables appear <i>only</i> with such parenthesized expressions,
    or in tests for conditional assembly (see below).&nbsp; Actually,
    the original assembler may have implemented a simpler expression
    evaluator than the modern assembler.&nbsp; For example, I've seen no
    LVDC source code that has parenthetical expressions (beyond the
    outer parentheses), so I don't really know if the original assembler
    supported them or not.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In most usages, an <tt>(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)</tt> appearing in an
    assembly language operand can be suffixed with an optional binary
    scaling factor<br>
    <blockquote><tt>(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)B<i>n</i></tt></blockquote>
    The optional scaling factor doesn't really make sense if it were
    used in the <tt>EQU</tt> statements defining the pseudo-variables,
    since the purpose of the scaling factor is really a relationship
    between the logical value of the number and the physically-pragmatic
    pattern of bits stored in memory.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the assembler
    allows any expression to be thusly suffixed by a scaling factor,
    even in the <tt>EQU</tt> statement itself. <br>
    <br>
    <i>Reassignment of pseudo variables</i>:&nbsp; One tricky aspect of
    pseudo-variables, which I referred to above as named numeric
    "constants", is that the values need not in fact be
    "constant".&nbsp; They can be reassigned with the <tt>REQ</tt>
    pseudo-op, and thus can have different values at different points in
    the code.&nbsp; For example, if you had LVDC code like the
    following,<br>
    <blockquote><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Code
          block 0 ...</i><br>
        COUNT&nbsp; EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)<br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Code block 1 ...</i><br>
        COUNT&nbsp; REQ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (COUNT+1)<br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Code block 2 ...</i><br>
        COUNT&nbsp; REQ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (COUNT+1)<br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Code block 3 ...</i><br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    then <tt>COUNT</tt> would be undefined while "Code block 0" was
    being assembled, but would have the value 1 while "Code block 1" was
    being assembled, 2 while "Code block 2" was being assembled, and so
    on.&nbsp; Among the LVDC program listings we have, this feature is
    not present at all until AS-512, and doesn't begin to be really
    exercised until AS-513, in which there are pre-processor constants
    that are <tt>REQ</tt>'d within macros, causing each expansion of a
    macro to be quite different than the previous expansion(s) of
    superficially the same macro.&nbsp; When you combine this feature
    with the concept mentioned earlier that pre-processor constants form
    a different namespace than variable names and program labels, then
    you can have a symbol appearing both namespaces, some of whose
    instances are subject to being <tt>REQ</tt>'d and some of which are
    not.&nbsp; And no, that's <i>not</i> just a theoretical concept;
    AS-513 has several such symbols, some of them performing their
    confusing magic within macros.&nbsp; And I <i>do</i> mean <i>confusing</i>.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; I have no insight as
        to how the original LVDC assembler implemented this
        concept.&nbsp; As far as the modern assembler is concerned,
        however, whenever it sees such an <tt>EQU</tt> or <tt>REQ</tt>,
        it implements it as what I call a "mangled" constant:&nbsp; The
        "<tt>COUNT EQU (1)</tt>" in the code above does indeed create
        "constant" called <tt>COUNT</tt> whose value can later be
        reassigned by <tt>REQ</tt>'s at will.&nbsp; But it also creates
        a "mangled constant" called <tt>COUNT#000</tt>, having the
        value of 1, whose value <i>cannot</i> be reassigned.&nbsp; When
        it encounters the first "<tt>COUNT REQ (COUNT+1)</tt>", it does
        update the value of <tt>COUNT</tt> to 2, but it also creates a
        mangled constant called <tt>COUNT#001</tt> with an unchangeable
        value of 2.&nbsp; And similarly, the assembler subsequently
        creates the mangled but true constant <tt>COUNT#002</tt> with a
        value of 3, and so on.&nbsp; Actually, the assembler will reuse
        symbol names that have matching values, so the numerical suffix
        isn't necessarily related to the order in which the symbols were
        defined.&nbsp; But regardless of that, when you look at an
        assembly listing produced by the modern assembler, you'll find
        it strewn with references to </font><font size="-1"><tt>COUNT#000</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, </font><font size="-1"><tt>COUNT#001</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, </font><font size="-1"><tt>COUNT#002</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, and so on, whereas the assembly listing output by
        the original assembler merely has </font><font size="-1"><tt>COUNT</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> in those places.<br>
        <br>
        You may wonder how these not-necessarily-constant constants are
        reflected in the listing of the symbol table emitted by the
        assembler?&nbsp; Well, the assembly listings we have that were
        created by the original assembler for AS-512 and AS-513 don't
        actually contain symbol tables!&nbsp; Or more accurately, what
        passes for a symbol table in those original assembly listings
        doesn't give you the values of any of the constants or the
        addresses of any of the variables or program labels, but instead
        simply tells you (by line number) where the symbols are
        referenced in the listing.&nbsp; And the pre-processor constants
        aren't even included anyway.&nbsp; This seems to be a pretty
        curious way of creating a symbol table, but the times have
        changed (a lot!), so who am I to say what was useful for LVDC
        programmer circa 1970?&nbsp; Besides, perhaps there were JCL
        options or something that controlled the type(s) of symbol table
        omitted, and we just happened to get the settings I personally
        don't like too much.&nbsp; This notion is bolstered by the
        observation that the contemporary assembly listings for
        AS-206RAM and PTC ADAPT SELF-TEST do indeed contain symbol
        tables in the sense I mean, though they do not appear to include
        the pre-processor constants either.&nbsp; The <i>modern</i>
        assembler, on the other hand" does indeed produce a symbol table
        with actual addresses of variables or program labels and actual
        values of pre-processor constants the way I like them.&nbsp;
        (Who'd have guessed?)&nbsp; In those tables, the unmangled
        symbols (like </font><font size="-1"><tt>COUNT</tt></font><font
        size="-1">) are simply omitted from the table entirely since
        their values can change (unless they were defined via </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>DEQD</tt></font><font size="-1"> rather then </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>EQU</tt></font><font size="-1">/</font><font
        size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font size="-1">, and hence aren't
        subject to mangling), but the mangled names (like </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>COUNT#000</tt></font><font size="-1"> or </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>COUNT#001</tt></font><font size="-1">) show the
        (unchanging) values just as you'd expect them to.<br>

          ENDIF<br>
        </tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    Alas, I'm not sure what all of the syntactical variations on the <tt><i>CONDITION</i></tt>
    are, and can only report those found in surviving LVDC source code,
    which at this point means PTC ADAPT SELF-TEST, AS-206RAM, AS-512,
    and AS-513.&nbsp; The variations I've seen are:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><i>PSEUDOVARIABLE</i>=(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt><i>PSEUDOVARIABLE</i>&lt;(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt><i>PSEUDOVARIABLE</i>&gt;(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)&gt;(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)</tt><tt><br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    For example, in first of these forms, if the value of the specified
    <tt><i>PSEUDOVARIABLE</i></tt> is equal the evaluated <i><tt>EXPRESSION</tt></i>,
    then enclosed code is retained by the preprocessor, and is thus
    eventually assembled.&nbsp; If not, then the enclosed code is
    discarded.&nbsp; The modern assembler supports those observed
    variants listed above, as well as the so-far unobserved variants<tt><br>

    <h3><a name="Assembly_Pass"></a>Assembly Pass</h3>
    <p>(Technically, what I'm calling the "assembly pass" here is really
      implemented in the new assembler, yaASM.py, in two successive
      passes, known the "discovery pass" and the "assembly pass".&nbsp;
      The former associates all program labels and variable names with
      physical addresses, while the latter performs the actual assembly
      using the now-resolved addresses.&nbsp; That detail is totally
      irrelevant and transparent to the user, but would be necessary
      information to anybody modifying yaASM.py itself.)<br>
    </p>
    <i></i>
    <p><i>Instruction operands</i>:&nbsp; Operand formats differ for
      some CPU instruction types, but most of them require a variable (a
      word in data memory), and conform to a pattern in which there are
      several allowed variants for specifying the operand:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A literal 3-digit octal number (such as 777 or 776), which is
        an offset into the DM/DS (Data Module / Data Sector) defined by
        the current contents of the HOP register.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The symbolic name of a variable or constant defined elsewhere
        in the program.&nbsp; The variable/constant has to be in the
        current DM/DS, so if the referenced symbol doesn't happen to be
        located in that particular module or sector, it could be a
        problem.</li>
      <li>An arithmetical expression involving symbolic names, such as <tt>CBTAB+1</tt>
        or <tt>CBTAB+(4*CBSTNO+1)</tt>.&nbsp; For a sufficiently
        complex expression, since as the latter one in the preceding
        sentence, the raw form of the instruction will appear in the
        assembly listing as if it were a comment (like a <tt>CALL</tt>
        line), and the fully resolved expression will appear marked with
        a "+" character as if it were a macro expansion ... which it
        probably is.&nbsp; For example, if <tt>(4*CBSTNO+1)</tt>
        resolves to 57, then the expanded instruction would be <tt>CBTAB+57</tt>.&nbsp;























































































































































        Note that such expressions, depending on what they contain, may
        resolve <i>either</i> to an address in memory, or else to a
        constant value.&nbsp; In the latter case, the numerical constant
        is treated like the constants described in the following item.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If the leading character is <tt>=</tt>, the assembler itself
        transparently allocates an <i>unnamed</i> variable in the
        current DM/DS, stores the value of the constant at that
        variable, and then uses the location of the new-created variable
        as the operand.&nbsp; In other words, not all program variables
        are explicitly defined by pseudo-ops ... some of them are
        transparently allocated in as needed by the assembler itself in
        memory locations not previously used for anything.&nbsp; Each
        numerically-unique constant is stored only once as a variable
        and is reused everywhere that requires it.&nbsp; There are
        several variations on what can follow the leading <tt>=</tt> in
        the operand:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Decimal literal numbers like <tt>=1B18</tt>, <tt>=3.14159E0B-4</tt>,
          and so on.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Octal literal numbers like <tt>=O0000004</tt> (note the
          alphabetic letter "O", which stands for Octal).</li>
        <li>HOP constants:&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>In operands like <tt>=H'<i>symbol</i></tt>, the <tt><i>symbol</i></tt>
            (representing the location of a variable or a location in
            the instruction stream) is converted into a HOP
            constant.&nbsp; Note that the <tt><i>symbol</i></tt> can be
            a forward reference.</li>
          <li>Another variant is <tt>=H'<i>symbol1</i>,<i>symbol2</i></tt>.&nbsp;









































            This variant also produces a HOP constant, but only the
            fields relating to instruction space are taken from <i><tt>symbol1</tt></i>,
            whereas the fields relating to data space are taken from <tt><i>symbol2</i></tt>.</li>

              This variation doesn't affect the produced object
              code.&nbsp; It's interesting, at least to me, to speculate
              about which of these alternatives (i.e., with or without
              the trailing quote) were envisaged at the time as the
              preferred syntax.&nbsp; Recall that we have no
              documentation of any kind about the original assembler,
              and therefore have no choice but to speculate concerning
              its features.&nbsp; Though it's tempting to suppose that "</font><font
              size="-1"><tt>=H'...'</tt></font><font size="-1">" was the
              preferred form and thus that "</font><font size="-1"><tt>=H'...</tt></font><font
              size="-1">" was merely a very common shortcut, I suspect
              the opposite.&nbsp; My guess is that the "</font><font
              size="-1"><tt>=H'...</tt></font><font size="-1">" was the
              only syntax recognized by the assembler, and that if a
              trailing single quote was encountered by the assembler it
              was just processed as the first character of the comment
              field.&nbsp; In other words, the single-quote only <i>accidentally</i>
              appeared to be part of the operand in the assembly-listing
              printout.&nbsp; Actually, it's fun to note that all
              examples of the suffixed quote appear in AS-513, and while
              there are 7 lines altogether in which it appears, those
              seven lines come from just two very-similar punch-cards
              that were apparently duplicated and reused, spreading
              their influence across multiple lines.&nbsp; Which, it
              seems to me, serves to reinforce the notion that the
              trailing suffix was merely something that accidentally
              worked out as the original programmer intended as opposed
              to being regarded as proper syntax.&nbsp; By the way, the
              affected lines in the original AS-513 code read as
              follows:<br>
            </font></p>

              between the operand field and the comment field.&nbsp;
              Whereas the original assembler allowed the operand field

        had an extraordinarily dangerous "feature", which thankfully had
        been removed by the time of the LVDC version of the
        assembler.&nbsp; If an operand was encountered which would
        ordinarily be the name of a variable, but for which no actual
        variable with that name was explicitly allocated in the source
        code, then the assembler would <i>automatically</i> <i>silently</i>
        allocate one in unused memory, in the same manner as for
        operands like <tt>=O<i>octal</i></tt> <i>constants</i>
        described in the item above.&nbsp; What makes this dangerous is
        the possibility of a typo in a variable name at one place in a
        program but not in other places.&nbsp; For example, if you had
        the following code, you might think that <tt>CLA</tt> was
        accessing <tt>ARGX12</tt> (with the value 12345 octal), when in

    <p>Except for the <tt>HOP</tt> instructions, the other CPU
      instructions that transfer program control target a location in
      the current IM/IS rather than a variable in the DM/DS, and thus
      require a different type of operand. Those instructions (<tt>TRA</tt>,
      <tt>TNZ</tt>, <tt>TMI</tt>) thus have operands in one of the
      following formats:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li><tt>*+(<i>expression</i>)</tt> or <tt>*-(<i>expression</i>)</tt>,
        where the algebraic <tt><i>expression</i></tt> consists of

    </ul>
    <p>Other exceptions:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The shift instruction, <tt>SHF</tt>, and the shorthand
        replacements for it, <tt>SHR</tt> and <tt>SHL</tt>.&nbsp; The
        latter two shorthand instructions take an operand of 0 or a
        positive decimal integer, and thus represent logical right or
        left shifts by a selectable number of positions.&nbsp; With "<tt>0</tt>"
        as the operand, as a special case, the accumulator is
        cleared.&nbsp; There are no uses of <tt>SHF</tt> in the
        existing source code, so while it must take an integer operand,
        I'm not sure whether it would be octal or decimal or something
        else.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; <tt>SHR</tt> and <tt>SHL</tt>
        are implemented as <tt>SHF</tt> operations, but <tt>SHF</tt>
        can only shift by 1 or 2 positions for LVDC, or 1 through 6
        positions for PTC.&nbsp; Therefore, if the operand for <tt>SHR</tt>
        or <tt>SHL</tt> is greater than 2 (6), the assembler
        transparently converts the operation to a minimum-length
        sequence of shorter shift operations.&nbsp; For example, for
        LVDC a <tt>SHL 5</tt> assembles to <tt>SHL 2</tt> / <tt>SHL 2</tt>
        / <tt>SHL 1</tt>.&nbsp; Consequently, depending on the operand,
        any given <tt>SHR</tt> or <tt>SHL</tt> may assemble to
        multiple executable words in memory rather than to a single
        word. </li>
      <li>The <tt>CDS</tt> instruction requires an operand of the form
        <tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS</i>,<i>DUPDN</i></tt> where the three octal
        fields are interpreted, respectively, as specifying a
        HOP-constant-like data module (0-7), data sector (0-17), and
        duplex vs simplex mode (0-1).&nbsp; The <tt>DEQD</tt> pseudo-op
        (see below) can be used to create symbolic macro names for such
        specifications, and so the operand for <tt>CDS</tt> can be such
        a symbolic macro name as well.</li>
      <li>The <tt>EXM</tt> instruction has operands of the form "<tt><i>target</i>,<i>syllable</i>,<i>modifier</i></tt>",












































































































































































        where <tt><i>target</i></tt>, <tt><i>syllable</i></tt>, and <tt><i>modifier</i></tt>
        are all small literal octal integer constants.&nbsp; These
        fields may be interpreted as follows:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt><i>target</i></tt> (0-3):&nbsp; Specifies offset in
          residual memory of target instruction:&nbsp; 0 for 600, 1 for
          640, 2 for 700, 3 for 740. (I.e., 200, 240, 300, or 340 in the
          residual memory sector.)<br>
        </li>
        <li><tt><i>syllable</i></tt> (0-1):&nbsp; Specifies syllable of
          the target instruction within the target word.<br>
        </li>
        <li><tt><i>modifier</i></tt> (0-17 octal):&nbsp; Specifies a
          4-bit modifier for the instruction:&nbsp; the two
          least-significant bits <i>replace</i> the corresponding bits
          in the target instruction, while the two most-significant bits
          <i>bitwise-OR</i> with the corresponding bits.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>The <tt>PIO</tt> and <tt>CIO</tt> instructions accept only
        literal octal constants (000-377 for <tt>PIO</tt>, 000-777 for
        <tt>CIO</tt>).&nbsp; All of the examples I saw in the original
        LVDC/PTC assembly listings were 0-padded, though yaASM.py does
        not enforce that restriction.<br>

            in PTC code.<br>
            <br>
            This pseudo-op encodes the <i><tt>text</tt></i> argument
            into consecutive memory locations.&nbsp; It could be used
            for preparing messages for printing on either the printer
            peripheral (see the <a href="#PRS">PRS</a> instruction) or
            the typewriter peripheral. <br>
            <br>
            The <i><tt>text</tt></i> operand is delimited by a leading
            '^' and trailing '$', which are not themselves encoded into
            memory.&nbsp; The assembler right-pads the <i><tt>text</tt></i>,
            if necessary, until it is a multiple of 4 characters ending
            in at least 2 spaces. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note</b>:&nbsp; The leading carat character (<tt>^</tt>)
            in <tt><i>text</i></tt> was not used in the original
            Apollo-era source code.&nbsp; It has been added to the
            assembly-language syntax for the convenience of the <i>modern</i>
            assembler (yaASM.py).&nbsp; That's because the <tt><i>text</i></tt>
            argument sometimes begins with a space character, and since
            the modern assembler does not enforce strict columnar
            alignment of the operand, it would otherwise have no way to
            ascertain where <tt><i>text</i></tt> begins.&nbsp; The
            original assembler, on the other hand, did enforce strict
            columnar alignment, and therefore required no delimiter at
            the beginning.<br>

            <p>In case it isn't obvious from the table above, code 00 is
              a blank space.&nbsp; The yellow-shaded characters have
              encodings in the PAST program octal listing that don't
              match the BA8421 encoding from wikipedia for some reason,
              so the table above has been doctored to match the
              assembler.&nbsp; The gray-background codes are
              non-printable, and the emulation displays them as '

            <p>Actually, while the assembler, the PTC printer, and the
              PTC typewriter all use characters encoded in BA8421 to a
              certain extent, and they all conform in terms of
              alphanumerics and the blank space, they differ among
              themselves to a certain extent as far as the special
              (non-alphanumeric) characters are concerned.&nbsp; Rather
              than reproduce all of those tables here, I'd simply refer
              you to our PTC front-panel emulation program, yaPTC.py, in
              which the table above is appears as the array called
              BA8421, the table for the printer peripheral appears as
              "BA8421a", and the table for the typwriter peripheral
              appears as "BA8421b".<br>
            </p>
            <p>I have googled some of weirder characters, since it
              wasn't obvious why they would be included in such a
              limited repertoire of symbols, and unexpectedly got some
              historical information about them that may actually be
              applicable to their usage in the PTC: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Code 77, the "group mark" character (a vertical line
                with three horizontal hashes) was "formerly used as a
                separator character for i/o operations".&nbsp; In the
                case of the original printer, it seems to have been used
                to flush the printer's internal memory buffer, by
                physically printing the contents of the buffer and then
                clearing the buffer.&nbsp; The buffer would normally
                have been flushed anyway after filling up, so explicitly
                sending the group mark would only have been necessary at
                the end of a sequence of characters which may not have
                completely filled the print buffer.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Code 74, the "square lozenge" character (a square with
                concave sides) was "used as a command delimiter in some
                very old computers".</li>
              <li>Code 32, the "double dagger" character (a vertical
                line with two horizontal hashes) is possibly used as an
                error indicator.</li>
            </ul>
            I think that the set of allowed characters for <tt><i>text</i></tt>
            is the intersection of the printable characters from the
            BA8421 set listed above and the EBCDIC character set.&nbsp;
            Unless I'm mistaken, that's just:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Digits:&nbsp; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br>
              </li>
              <li>Upper case alphabetic:&nbsp; A B C D E F G H I J K L M
                N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</li>
              <li>A blank space<br>
              </li>
              <li>Other:&nbsp; / . , - + * ( ).<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The reason for this restriction is that the input
            assembly-language source files and the printed assembly
            listing are encoded in EBCDIC while the encoding of the
            output assembled octals for the <tt>BCI</tt> pseudo-op uses
            the BA8421 coding scheme.&nbsp; Therefore, only characters
            available simultaneously in both characters are meaningful
            from input through output of the assembler.<br>
            <br>
            As far as the octals assembled for <tt>BCI</tt> are
            concerned, each of the memory locations allocated by the
            pseudo-op encodes exactly 4 characters of the message.&nbsp;
            The first character of the string occupies the two
            most-significant octal digits of the first memory location,
            the next character occupies the next lower two octal digits
            of that memory location, and so on. Thus, encoding 4
            characters requires 24 bits per 26-bit memory word.&nbsp;
            The least-significant bits of each memory word are always
            unused and are 0. <br>
            <br>
            For example, when the following is assembled,<br>
            <blockquote>&nbsp;<tt>BCI&nbsp;&nbsp; ^TYPE OCTAL
                CHARACTERS$</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            the assembler notes that "<tt>TYPE...</tt>" has the BA8421
            character octal character codes 23, 30, 47, 65, ..., and
            thus the assembled octal encoding of the string is
            233047650, ....&nbsp; That's pretty straightforward.<br>
            <br>
            In the <i>printed</i> assembly listing output, though,
            things are much less straightforward.&nbsp; While the
            original assembler did print out a representation of how the
            <tt><i>text</i></tt> string assembled, presumably intended
            to be helpful to the programmer, what it ended up printing
            was a pretty goofy representation of the original
            text.&nbsp; For example, consider the example <tt>BCI</tt>
            usage mentioned above, which comes from page 3 of the PAST
            program.&nbsp; The assembly listing displays the assembled
            memory locations as<br>
            <blockquote><tt>CHPV</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>0OTC</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>/L0T</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>Y/R/</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>TCVR</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>B000</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            As nearly as I can guess, the assembler derived this
            nonsensical representation roughly by the following
            procedure:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Get the BA8421 encoding of a character from the <tt><i>text</i></tt>
                operand.&nbsp; For example, octal 23 for 'T'. </li>
              <li>Add this to octal 260 (hex B0).&nbsp; For the 'T' this
                would give 23+260=303.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Interpret this latter value as the <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC#Code_page_layout">EBCDIC</a>
                code for a character and print it.&nbsp; For example, in
                EBCDIC, octal 303 (hex C3) is 'C', and that's why 'C'
                ends up being printed out in place of 'T'.<br>
              </li>
              <li>For <i>some</i> characters in <tt><i>text</i></tt>,
                this procedure can produce an encoded value that doesn't
                represent any character in EBCDIC, and which therefore
                can't be printed as-is.&nbsp; In that case, the
                procedure seems to be to hunt around by
                adding/subtracting multiples of octal 100 (0x40) to the
                EBCDIC code until a printable character is
                obtained.&nbsp; Here's how that works out in detail in a
                few examples:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Space character:&nbsp; ' ' → 0<sub>8</sub> (BA8421)
                  → 0xB0 (EBCDIC) → undefined.&nbsp; The only printable
                  EBCDIC character that can be reached from 0xB0 by
                  adding or subtracting multiples of 0x40 is 0xB0+0x40 =
                  0xF0 (EBCDIC) → '0'.</li>
                <li>'A' → 61<sub>8</sub> (BA8421) → 0xE1 (EBCDIC) →
                  undefined.&nbsp; The only reachable printable EBCDIC
                  character is 0xE1-0x80=0x61 → '/'.</li>
                <li>',' → 33<sub>8</sub> (BA8421) → 0xCB (EBCDIC) →
                  undefined.&nbsp; The only reachable printable EBCDIC
                  character is 0xCB-0x80=04B → '.'.</li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
            <p>Yes, it seems silly to <i>me</i> too.&nbsp; Don't blame
              me.&nbsp; Perhaps there's some amazing rationale for this
              seemingly-loopy procedure that I simply don't
              understand.&nbsp; If you know of one, let me know.&nbsp; I
              suspect it's just a bug, but it seems ridiculous that a
              bug as ridiculous as printing out "CHPV..." in place of
              "TYPE..." went unnoticed back in the day!&nbsp; The modern
              assembler (yaAGC.py) by default <i>does not</i> reproduce
              this behavior — i.e., by default it prints out a correct
              human-readable representation — but if you're a purist who
              insists on seeing the ridiculously buggy printout instead,
              you can use the assembler's <tt>--past-bugs</tt>
              command-line switch to restore the original behavior and
              enforce the buggy printout.<br>

          <td valign="top">The <tt>BLOCK</tt> pseudo-op tells the
            assembler not to break up the succeeding <i><tt>n</tt></i>
            instructions in memory.&nbsp; For example, you might use <tt>BLOCK</tt>
            for particularly time-sensitive code, to insure that it
            really takes the amount of time you've designed it to
            take.&nbsp; Another common use for very short blocks is to
            protect instructions like "<tt>TMI *+<i>m</i></tt>", for
            which it would be disastrous if the assembler were to insert
            any extra instructions or perform a memory-sector change
            between the instruction and its targeted destination.&nbsp;
            Recall that the assembler transparently inserts instructions
            like <tt>TRA</tt> or <tt>HOP</tt> in order to detour
            around already-allocated memory or prevent memory-sector
            overflows, and what the <tt>BLOCK</tt> pseudo-op does is to
            prevent any such insertions <i>within</i> the block.<br>
            <br>
            I'm not certain I understand the <i>full</i> scope of the
            actions <tt>BLOCK</tt> might take under various
            circumstances.&nbsp; (Realize that we have no documentation
            of any kind concerning the characteristics of the pseudo-ops
            and assembler directives I'm describing for you, and thus I
            am simply giving you my inferences based on examination of
            LVDC source code and my successes vs failures in
            implementation of the modern LVDC assembler.)&nbsp; But
            here's what I believe is going on:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>If the <tt>BLOCK</tt> appears immediately after an <tt>ORG</tt>
                or <tt>ORGDD</tt> (see below), then its action is
                merely to seek the block of <i><tt>n</tt></i> unused
                words at the lowest offset within the same memory
                sector/syllable.&nbsp; In other words, it adjusts the
                assembler's program counter before proceeding with the
                block, but does not of itself insert any extra
                code.&nbsp; If there's not enough room in the current
                sector, it moves to the next sector, and so on.<br>
              </li>
              <li>If the <tt>BLOCK</tt> instead appears within an
                instruction stream, preceded by an instruction (rather
                than an <tt>ORG</tt>/<tt>ORGDD</tt>), then the
                assembler will insert an appropriate <tt>TRA</tt> or <tt>HOP</tt>
                between the preceding instruction and the block.&nbsp;
                The block itself will therefore move to a later position
                within the memory sector/syllable, or to an altogether
                different memory module/sector/syllable.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <tt>BLOCK</tt> is a little trickier to understand for the
            case of <tt><i>n</i></tt>=1, but there are indeed
            situations where "<tt>BLOCK 1</tt>" usefully appears in the

            <tt>BLOCK</tt> is used only for blocks of <i>instructions</i>
            (which are one syllable wide), and is not used for blocks of

          <td valign="middle">This preprocessor pseudo-op is a variant

            referencing a specific fixed location in memory, specified
            by its module, sector, and offset, which are literal octal
            constants.&nbsp; Since the pseudo-variable exists only in
            the preprocessor, it does not store anything at that
            location, but merely defines a symbol representing that
            particular memory configuration.&nbsp; The symbol for the
            pseudo-variable created in this manner did not appear in the

            do so in symbol tables produced by yaASM.py.&nbsp; As far as

            broadly these various pseudo-op forms were supported by the

            available to us:<br>

                appearance of a plus or minus sign and an integer, but
                the brackets themselves don't literally appear in the
                source code.</li>
            </ul>
            This pseudo-op is similar in its effect to the <tt>ORGDD</tt>
            pseudo-op (see below), except that it only modifies the
            assembler's current data-memory pointer, leaving the
            instruction-memory pointer untouched.&nbsp; It does not
            allocate any memory.&nbsp; The location parameter <tt><i>DLOC</i></tt>
            is treated as a suggestion rather than as a hard
            specification of the offset into the data-memory sector,
            since if the assembler finds that the requested <tt><i>DLOC</i></tt>
            has already been used, it will search upward through the
            data sector until it finds a location that hasn't already
            been used.&nbsp; If any of the fields <i><tt>DM</tt></i>, <i><tt>DS</tt></i>,
            or <i><tt>DLOC</tt></i> is empty, they default to zero.<br>
            <br>
            Regarding the <tt>DOG <i>SYMBOL</i></tt> form, one might
            suppose (as I did), that the <tt><i>SYMBOL</i></tt> must be
            a location in data memory, such as a variable or a literal
            constant.&nbsp; That's the usual case, and in that case the
            behavior is exactly as one would guess.&nbsp; But there are
            exceptions:&nbsp; There are very rare cases in which <tt><i>SYMBOL</i></tt>
            is associated with a location in code.&nbsp; In this case, <tt>DOG</tt>
            assigns the assembler's internal <tt><i>DM</i></tt>, <i><tt>DS</tt></i>,
            and <tt><i>DLOC</i></tt> from the <i><tt>IM</tt></i>, <tt><i>IS</i></tt>,
            and <tt><i>LOC</i></tt> associated with the <tt><i>SYMBOL</i></tt>.<br>

            These examples also illustrate the important point that the

            the namespace used for left-hand symbols naming variables or

            "<tt>GEPLON DEC (GEPLON)B10</tt>" is at line 016820.<br>
            <br>
            <tt>REQ</tt> differs from <tt>EQU</tt> only in that it
            redefines an already-<tt>EQU</tt>'d assembly constant to
            have a different value. <br>
            <br>
            With that said, one would suppose that the following
            conditions might result in assembly errors or warnings:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>An <tt>EQU</tt> for a left-hand symbol which has
                already been defined with <tt>EQU</tt>.&nbsp; (Or at
                least already defined with a different value.)<br>
              </li>
              <li> A <tt>REQ</tt> for a left-hand symbol which has not
                already been defined with <tt>EQU</tt>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In fact, these conditions did not result in any error or
              warning messages in the original assembler.&nbsp; In
              particular, when multiple <tt>EQU</tt>'s are encountered
              for the same assembler constant, the assembler seems to
              simply silently ignore all of them after the first
              one.&nbsp; Whether this was a bug in the original
              assembler or in my thinking about what's reasonable, I
              can't say.&nbsp; The modern LVDC assembler mimics the
              original assembler in this behavior.<br>

          <td valign="top"><a name="FlowDirective"></a>This directive is
            of my own invention, is not present in the original LVDC
            assembly language, and wouldn't be recognized by the
            original LVDC assembler.&nbsp; It is ignored by the modern
            LVDC assembler, and does not in any way affect generation of
            object code.&nbsp; Rather, it is used by separate software,
            the LVDC flowchart generator, for creation of flowcharts
            that hopefully correspond somewhat to the structure of the
            LVDC source code.<br>
            <br>
            The <tt>FLOW</tt> directive is intended to allow
            corrections to the flowchart annotations present in the LVDC
            source code, while leaving the original LVDC source-code
            lines providing the faulty annotations untouched. <br>
            <br>
            Each <tt>FLOW</tt> directive provides corrections for the
            original source-code line that <i>immediately</i> follows
            it. As you can see from the argument structure, 7 separate
            properties of the flowchart annotations can be corrected for
            any given source-code line.&nbsp; None of the 7 fields of
            the directive can contain either spaces or commas, except
            for the final field (<tt><i>CM</i></tt>), thus no delimiting
            between the items is needed other than the commas
            themselves.&nbsp; None of the 7 fields can contain
            double-quote characters except as described in a
            moment.&nbsp; Any field which is left empty (i.e., if there
            are just two adjacent commas with nothing between them)
            indicates a flowchart annotation which is already correct
            and does not need to be corrected.&nbsp; Conversely, if you
            want to forcibly correct a non-empty annotation to become
            empty, you can surround the associated field with double
            quotes (as in ,"",).&nbsp; For example,<br>
            <blockquote><tt>FLOW &nbsp;&nbsp; ,,,,,,</tt> <br>
            </blockquote>
            would correct none of the annotations of the succeeding
            source-code line, whereas<br>
            <blockquote><tt>FLOW &nbsp;&nbsp; "","","","","","",""</tt>
              <br>
            </blockquote>
            would correct every annotation of the succeeding line to be
            blank.&nbsp; As a labor-saving feature, trailing commas can
            simply be omitted, and it is assumed that the omitted fields
            are blank.&nbsp; So for example, "<tt>FLOW Q</tt>" is
            equivalent to "<tt>FLOW Q,,,,,,</tt>".<br>
            <br>
            The 7 fields are interpreted as follows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><tt><i>COL71</i></tt> — This is the character
                appearing in column 71 of the source-code line, and
                relates to the kind of flowchart object the annotation
                is requesting.&nbsp; For example, "P" asks for a
                rectangular box representing a call to an external
                procedure or expansion of a macro.&nbsp; "I" asks for a
                parallelogram box representing an i/o operation.&nbsp;
                "Q" asks for a diamond box that describes a yes/no test
                being performed.&nbsp; "Y" and "N" represent yes/no
                arrows exiting from such a diamond box.&nbsp; And so on.</li>
              <li><tt><i>LHS</i></tt> — This is the symbolic label
                appearing in columns 1-6 of the source-code line.</li>
              <li><tt><i>OPCODE</i></tt> — This is the assembly-language
                instruction appearing in columns 8-15 of the source-code
                line.</li>
              <li><tt><i>OPERAND</i></tt> — This is the operand of the <tt><i>OPCODE</i></tt>,
                nominally appearing in columns 16-23 of the source-code
                line, though actually extending rightward until the
                first space is encountered.</li>
              <li><tt><i>DEBUG</i></tt> — This field is one I use from
                time to time for debugging the flowchart-generation
                software, so you should just assume that it is left
                empty.<br>
              </li>
              <li><tt><i>CP, CM</i></tt> — These fields can appear in
                either full-line comments or in inline comments,
                following the <tt><i>CF</i></tt> field (if any), up to
                but not including column 71, stripped of leading and
                trailing spaces, and with all multiple spaces condensed
                to a single space.&nbsp; Normalized in this way, the
                comments are always in one of these three forms:&nbsp; "<tt>(<i>CP</i>)<i>CM</i></tt>",

































                "<tt>(<i>CP</i>) <i>CM</i></tt>", or just "<i><tt>CM</tt></i>".&nbsp;

































                Recall that <tt><i>CP</i></tt> cannot contain spaces.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In my experience, the most-common type of correction
              would be to add a missing annotation to column 71.&nbsp;
              For example, if you had some code that looked like the
              following<br>
            </p>
            <pre>       CLA     MYVAR   IS MY VARIABLE NEGATIVE?<br>       TMI     NEGTIV                  <br>       TRA     POSTIV                                                 N
</pre>
            it's clearly a test whether the variable <tt>MYVAR</tt> is
            negative or not, along with appropriate branches depending
            on the results of the test.&nbsp; But the flowchart
            annotations are incomplete, so the flowchart generator
            (which operates almost entirely from annotations rather than
            from the code itself) won't draw it that way.&nbsp; In
            principle, the way this code fragement <i>should</i> have
            been annotated is:<br>
            <pre>       CLA     MYVAR   IS MY VARIABLE NEGATIVE?                       Q<br>       TMI     NEGTIV                                                 Y<br>       TRA     POSTIV                                                 N
</pre>
            In many cases, the flowchart-generator software can figure
            out what was meant in spite of incomplete annotations,
            whereas the annotations in this example are just too
            incomplete for it to do so.&nbsp; <i>But</i>, if were to
            add a couple of <tt>FLOW</tt> directives, we'd produce the
            same effect as the nominally-correct annotations and we'd be
            fine:<br>
            <pre>       FLOW    Q<br>       CLA     MYVAR   IS MY VARIABLE NEGATIVE?<br>       FLOW    Y<br>       TMI     NEGTIV                  <br>       TRA     POSTIV                                                 N<br></pre>

          <td valign="middle">This preprocessor pseudo-op defines to the
            assembler (without generating any actual code) the name of a
            kind of macro that, when used, will pack a pattern of
            bit-fields into a single word-size constant.&nbsp; In the <tt>FORM</tt>
            statement itself, the field-widths (if literal integers) are
            decimal, whereas when the macro is used, the values of the
            fields (if literal integers) default to being octal.&nbsp;
            An example may make all this clearer:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>MYPAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                FORM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,3,4,5,6</tt><tt>,6<br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                1,2,3,4,5,6<br>
              </tt></blockquote>
            The first of these lines defines a macro, <tt>MYPAT</tt>,
            which can pack a 2-bit, a 3-bit, a 4-bit, a 5-bit, and two
            6-bit fields into a single 26-bit field.&nbsp; The LVDC
            word-size is exactly 26 bits, so the packed bits exactly fit
            a word.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The second of the lines shown above is what invokes the <tt>MYPAT</tt>
            macro.&nbsp; It compiles the fields and stores the packed
            word at the memory location <tt>MYCON</tt>.&nbsp; In this
            example, various fields (including the right-most 0 just
            mentioned) will be as follows in binary notation:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>01 010 0011 00100 000101 000110 0</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            or octal 243101214.&nbsp; Where did the <tt>0</tt> at the
            very end come from?&nbsp; Confusingly, the way the assembler
            displays word-size constants, the least-significant bit is
            always 0 (because it's the physical position in which parity
            is stored), so the constant is actually aligned at bit 27
            and appears as exactly 9 octal digits.&nbsp; Because of
            this, in other words, it will seem in an assembly listing
            that there's always an unused right-most 27th bit, which is
            the right-most <tt>0</tt> above.<br>
            <br>
            Is it possible for <tt><i>a</i>+<i>b</i>+...</tt> to total
            to something less than 26 bits?&nbsp; There are rare cases
            of it in existing code, and the unused bits (at right) are
            all set to 0.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The PTC ADAPT Self-Test program doesn't have any <tt>FORM</tt>
            statements in it.&nbsp; And for other early code like
            AS-206RAM, what I've said above is the full story.&nbsp;
            However, for later code like AS-512 or AS-513, there are
            several other possibilities for the parameters in the <tt>FORM</tt>
            statement:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Any parameter could be one of the following string
                literals:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><tt>DM</tt> — This means that the corresponding
                  parameter in the macro invocation must be a symbol
                  representing a location in memory.&nbsp; The DM
                  component of that memory location, which is a value in
                  the range 0 through 7, is embedded in a field that's 3
                  bits wide.<br>
                </li>
                <li><tt>DS</tt> — This means that the corresponding
                  parameter in the macro invocation must be a symbol
                  representing a location in memory.&nbsp; The DS
                  component of that memory location, which is a value in
                  the range 00 through 17 (octal), is embedded in a
                  field that's 4 bits wide.</li>
                <li><tt>DA</tt> — This means that the corresponding
                  parameter in the macro invocation must be a symbol
                  representing a location in memory.&nbsp; The offset of
                  that memory location within the sector, which is a
                  value in the range 000 through 377 (octal), is
                  embedded in a field that's 8 bits wide.</li>
                <li>And possibly others I'm not aware of, such as <tt>IM</tt>,
                  <tt>IS</tt>, <tt>S</tt>, and <tt>A</tt>.&nbsp; Not
                  having seen any of those as of yet, however, I have

                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Or the parameters may be literal decimals suffixed by
                an extra alphabetic character.&nbsp; The literal
                decimals still indicate the number of bits in the
                associated field, just as above.&nbsp; The allowed
                suffixes seem to indicate the format of the fields in
                the invocations of the form:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>"B":&nbsp; Numerical base for literal numbers is
                  binary.</li>
                <li>"O":&nbsp; Numerical base for literal numbers is
                  octal.</li>
                <li>"D":&nbsp; Numerical base for literal numbers is
                  decimal.&nbsp; Fixed-point or floating-point numbers
                  are also accepted, and are rounded to the nearest
                  integer.<br>
                </li>
                <li>"P":&nbsp; Literal numbers are decimal fixed-point
                  or floating point.&nbsp; If the parameter evaluates to
                  a fixed-point or floating-point number (rather than to
                  an integer), then an implicit scale factor of B-29 is
                  applied.&nbsp; (Proviso:&nbsp; I'm not actually sure
                  what rules the original assembler used to apply this
                  B-29 scaling, but this is what works for me!)&nbsp;
                  The scaled numbers are rounded to the nearest integer.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            For example, if we defined a form with the statement "<tt>MYFORM









































              FORM 5B,6O,7D,3P,...</tt>", then we might invoke it with
            binary, octal, decimal, and floating-point parameters as "<tt>MYFORM









































              10110,46,89,4.3B29, ...</tt>", which would assemble to <tt>10110









































              101110 1011001 100 ...</tt>.<br>
            <ul>
            </ul>
            <p>As an example of <tt>DM</tt>, <tt>DS</tt>, and <tt>DA</tt>
              parameters from existing code, AS-512 has the following
              items in it:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A variable called <tt>V.INCU</tt> corresponding to

                DA=371 octal).</li>
              <li>A variable called <tt>V.FU</tt> corresponding to

                Notice that this only accounts for 1+4+3+1+8+8=25 bits,

            <p>According to my description above, the invocation of <tt>ZRLOC</tt>

            <p>where the final two bits on the right are the unused 26th
              bit of the form and the parity bit.&nbsp; In octal this is
              311763770, which is indeed precisely what the AS-512
              assembly listing tells us appears there.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Regarding the parameters for the invocation of an
              already-defined form, beyond the possibilities described
              above, they could be parenthesized expressions involving
              constant values and literals, in case the assembler will
              compute the expressions.&nbsp; Note that such
              parenthesized expressions may evaluate to non-integers,
              such as <tt>(2.4*2)</tt>.&nbsp; While I have a pretty
              small sample of such lines of code, It appears to me that
              such floating-point values may be rounded to the nearest
              integer.&nbsp; At any rate, that's how the modern
              assembler treats them.</p>
            <p>Consider the following actual example from AS-512:<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><tt>LADDER FORM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1B,3O,1B,5P,11D,5P</tt><tt><br>
                </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  LADDER&nbsp; 0,2,0,(1*2),0,(3*2)</tt><br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We'd expect the invocation of <tt>LADDER</tt> to
              assemble to the following (in binary fields):<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><tt>0 010 0 00010 00000000000 00110 0</tt><br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As a 9-digit octal number, this is:<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote><tt>101000014<br>
              </tt></blockquote>
            And indeed, that's exactly what the AS-512 assembly listing
            tells us it really does assemble to.<br>

            ADAPT SELF-TEST.&nbsp; To explain them, I need to give you a
            bit more information about how the assembler allocates data
            memory then you might otherwise like to know about.&nbsp; By
            <i>data memory</i>, I mean an area consisting of 26-bit
            values that combine memory syllables 0 and 1, versus <i>instruction








































              memory</i> that consists of 13-bit values each occupying a
            single syllable. Roughly speaking, there are two ways of
            allocating data memory.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The first way is to do so explicitly, under direct control
            of the source code.&nbsp; This is accomplished by using
            pseudo-ops such as <tt>DEC</tt>, <tt>OCT</tt>, <tt>HPC</tt>,
            <tt>DFW</tt>, <tt>BSS</tt>, or a predefined <tt>FORM</tt>,
            and in principle it gives you complete control and
            transparency concerning where your data words are stored.<br>
            <br>
            The second way is indirect:&nbsp; the assembler notices that
            it needs a word of memory, finds one that hasn't already
            been allocated, and then allocates it.&nbsp; When this
            happens, you have little transparency that it has occurred,
            and little control over where it occurs.&nbsp; This is a
            feature of the LVDC assembler, and does not happen at all in
            the AGC or AGS assemblers, in which the programmer retains
            complete control, at the cost of some convenience.&nbsp;
            There are several reasons it may happen in the LVDC
            assembler, and I won't go over all of them here, but an
            important case would be an assembly-language instruction
            like "<tt>CLA</tt><tt> =5</tt>", which means "load the
            accumulator with a value of 5".&nbsp; However, the LVDC CPU
            has no such instruction.&nbsp; Its CLA instruction would
            instead demand an operand that's the address of a variable
            containing the value it's supposed to load into the
            accumulator.&nbsp; Thus an "instruction like "<tt>CLA =5</tt>"
            is actually functionally equivalent to a pair lines of code
            something like<br>
            <blockquote><tt>FIVE &nbsp; DEC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5</tt><br>
              <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><br>
              <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIVE</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            What the assembler would do when it sees "<tt>CLA =5</tt>"
            is to:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Allocate a memory location in an accessible memory
                sector.</li>
              <li>Store the desired constant value into it (5 in this
                case).</li>
              <li>Use that newly-allocated variable as the operand (of
                the <tt>CLA</tt> instruction in this case).<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            The subset of data memory automatically allocated by the
            LVDC assembler is referred to as <i>literal memory</i>.&nbsp;








































            <br>
            <br>
            Literal memory consists entirely of constants, because there
            are no symbolic names assigned to the locations in literal
            memory, and thus you cannot access them using LVDC
            instructions like <tt>STO</tt> (unless you happened to know
            their numerical addresses).&nbsp; Because literal memory is
            constant — i.e., the values in it do not change — the LVDC
            assembler tries to be efficient by reusing the values in
            literal memory if it can.&nbsp; For example, if you have
            code like the following<br>
            <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =5</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =5</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =5</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            and if each of these instructions has that same accessible
            data-memory sectors, then the assembler will only allocate a
            single literal-memory location to hold the 5, and will reuse
            it for each of these instructions.<br>
            <br>
            Now (finally!) that brings us to <tt>LIT</tt> and <tt>ENDLIT</tt>.&nbsp;








































            Suppose that for some reason presumably unrelated to the
            various uses of literal memory, you also have some explicit
            lines of code such as the following:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><br>
              <tt>O3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                3</tt><br>
              <tt>O4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                4</tt><br>
              <tt>O5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                5</tt><br>
              <tt>O6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                6</tt><br>
              <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            If your intention as a programmer is that these are
            constants, you might like to add them to the pool of literal
            memory, so that when the assembler sees something like "<tt>CLA








































              =4</tt>" or "<tt>CLA =5</tt>" it will be able to reuse the
            constants known <tt>O4</tt> and <tt>O5</tt> instead of
            allocating new locations to hold 4 and 5.&nbsp; But on its
            own, the assembler can't do that, because it doesn't <i>know</i>
            that <tt>O4</tt> and <tt>O5</tt> are constants; for all it
            knows, perhaps 4 and 5 are simply the initial values of a
            variable, and not constant values that can be relied upon
            for all time.&nbsp; The <tt>LIT</tt> and <tt>UNLIT</tt>
            pseudo-ops are the solution to this little dilemma:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIT</tt><br>
              <tt>O3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                3</tt><br>
              <tt>O4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                4</tt><br>
              <tt>O5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                5</tt><br>
              <tt>O6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                6</tt><br>
              <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDLIT</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            By enclosing the definitions of your constants in <tt>LIT</tt>/<tt>ENDLIT</tt>,
            you inform the assembler that that the enclosed locations
            can be considered as constants that belong to literal
            memory, rather than as variables, though unlike most literal
            memory they retain their symbolic labels, the addresses
            you've assigned them, and their consecutive order in memory.<br>

            In that case, the first previously-unused location in the

            specifying <tt><i>DLOC</i></tt> explicitly does not
            necessarily imply that the data location is set to <i><tt>DLOC</tt></i>,
            since if that location has already been used, the next
            unused location after that will be selected instead, and the

            <br>

            The first 3 <tt>OCT</tt>s would be at addresses 0-16-20,
            0-16-21, and 0-16-22.&nbsp; The final <tt>OCT</tt> would be
            address 0-16-23.&nbsp; It should not be inferred that the
            addresses 0-16-0 through 0-16-17 are completely filled up
            (as they would be for a similar LVDC pseudo-op <tt>ORGDD</tt>),





























































































            because <tt>ORG</tt> merely increments the preceding
            address (rather than searching for the first unallocated
            address as in the LVDC's <tt>ORGDD</tt>).&nbsp; In fact, it
            appears to me that <tt>ORG</tt> with <tt>DLOC</tt> left
            empty never goes to <tt>DLOC</tt>=0, and instead starts
            with <tt>DLOC</tt>=1. <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, it appears to me that the original assembler had a
            bug, which we intentionally reproduce in the modern
            assembler (yaASM.py).&nbsp; The bug is that even if no data
            words had been allocated between one ORG and the next, the
            assembler still assumed that a <i>minimum</i> of 1 word had
            been allocated anyway.&nbsp; Suppose, for example, we were
            to append the following code to the sample above:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,2,0,3,0,16,</tt><br>
              <tt> </tt><tt><tt>ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,2,0,3,0,16,</tt><br>

            </blockquote>
            The <tt>OCT</tt> would be at address 0-16-26, because each
            of the final 2 <tt>ORG</tt>s would incorrectly have assumed
            that at least one word had been allocated prior to it. <br>

            As far as the "<tt><tt>ORG <i>symbol</i>,<i>symbol2</i></tt></tt>"

            <br>
            The latter two forms appear in later source code like AS-512
            and AS-513, but not in earlier source code like PTC ADAPT
            Self-Test and AS-206RAM, so it's unclear whether all
            versions of the original LVDC assembler supported them.<br>

            </blockquote>
            The "<tt>SYN <i>symbol</i></tt>" form of the pseudo-op
            tells the assembler to treat the left-hand symbol as a
            synonym for <tt><i>symbol</i></tt>.&nbsp; This is similar
            in concept to <tt>EQU</tt>, which essentially creates
            synonyms for numerical constants.&nbsp; But it differs in
            that <tt>EQU</tt> is part of the preprocessor while <tt>SYN</tt>
            is not, and thus <tt>SYN</tt> can reference <i><tt>symbol</tt></i>
            defined anywhere in the source code, whereas <tt>EQU</tt>
            can only reference <i><tt>symbol</tt></i> defined earlier
            in the source code.&nbsp; Further, <tt>SYN</tt> must
            reference program labels or variables — i.e., a symbol
            related to an actual memory address — and this cannot
            reference symbols like assembler constants; whereas the
            reverse is true for <tt>EQU</tt>.<br>
            <br>
            Alas, we have no documentation of the original assembler, so
            the explanation that follows of the "<tt>SYN *INS</tt>" and
            form "<tt>SYN *DAT</tt>" forms is based on my own
            observations.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            What <tt>SYN *DAT</tt> does is to tell the assembler that
            the left-hand symbol associates with the data-memory pointer
            of the <i>next</i> instruction or data-allocation pseudo-op
            the assembler encounters.&nbsp; In most usages in actual
            source code, this turns out to be the same thing as the
            assembler's current internal data pointer.&nbsp; But you
            can't rely on it, because there are cases in which that
            assumption fails rather badly.&nbsp; The worst case, from my
            perspective, is the <tt>SS1</tt> macro used in AS-512
            source code.&nbsp; For illustrative purposes, here's a
            simple macro I've modeled after just the problematic portion
            of <tt>SS1</tt>:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>MYSS1&nbsp; MACRO</tt><br>
              <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

              <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMAC</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            Now, macro <tt>SS1</tt> is used many, many times throughout
            the AS-512 source code, but with our simple model macro,
            here's what just the very first expansion looks like:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>S.TTB1 MYSS1</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            which expands to<br>
            <blockquote><tt>S.TTB1 SYN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *DAT</tt><br>
              <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            The code preceding this expansion happens to have left the
            data-memory pointer set to a location in memory module 2,
            sector 17.&nbsp; However, the <tt>SYN</tt> will assign
            symbol <tt>S.TTB1</tt> to module 6, sector 11 instead,
            because the <i>next</i> data-word encountered comes from
            the <tt>OCT 0</tt>, and intervening <tt>DOGD</tt> does not
            itself allocate any data memory words even though it does
            affect the memory pointers.&nbsp; Thus if you had relied
            upon <tt>S.TTB1</tt> to represent an address in module 2,
            sector 17, you would have been badly mistaken.&nbsp; Perhaps
            I make too big a deal of this, but <i>I</i> had assumed
            that the current data pointers were what were relevant and I
            was mistaken.&nbsp; It took quite a bit of effort eventually
            to come to an understanding of the actual behavior of <tt>SYN








































              *DAT</tt> vs a more-simplistic view of it.<br>
            <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b> It's not clear to
                me why they may have thought this was reasonable

            assembler.&nbsp; I suspect that the intended behavior may be

            next-instruction-encountered behavior just described for <tt>SYN








































              *DAT</tt>, but there's no usage in actual LVDC source code

            <br>
            As I mentioned, in no case does <tt>SYM</tt> actually

            to specific memory addresses, whether or not those memory
            addresses are actually allocated (by some other
            means).&nbsp; For example, upon reaching an address
            referenced by a <tt>SYN</tt>, the assembler will make no
            effort to skip over that address.<br>

                instructions as a coding convenience when a section of
                code would otherwise cause a memory sector to
                overflow.)&nbsp; </li>
              <li>It further informs the assembler not to automatically

            which would assure that the <tt>BSS</tt> and the two <tt>HPC</tt>'s








































            were in contiguous memory.&nbsp; When the table consists of
            a sequence of data pseudo-ops like <tt>BSS</tt>, <tt>HPC</tt>,
            <tt>DEC</tt>, or <tt>OCT</tt> like this, each of which
            itself allocates one or more words, <tt>TABLE</tt> is easy
            to comprehend. However, a table could instead comprise a
            sequence of instructions, with each instruction occupying a
            syllable rather than a wide word of memory.&nbsp; So one
            must question how 2*<tt><i>number</i></tt> instructions are
            packed within the <i><tt>number</tt></i> words of the
            table.&nbsp; This is determined by the <tt>USE</tt>
            pseudo-op (see below) and <tt>ORG</tt> pseudo-op (see
            above).&nbsp; There are instances in AS-512 of <tt>TABLE</tt>
            usage both with <tt>USE DAT</tt> and with <tt>USE INST</tt>,
            though it is unclear in the latter case why <tt>TABLE</tt>
            was used in preference to <tt>BLOCK</tt>.&nbsp; At any
            rate, <tt>TABLE</tt> itself does not enforce any specific
            ordering/packing behavior, and it's the programmer's
            responsibility to handle it.<br>
            <br>
            However, the protections afforded by <tt>TABLE</tt> affect
            only the lines of code immediately encountered by the
            assembler after encountering the <tt>TABLE</tt> itself. But
            if that's true, how are we then to interpret usages such as
            the following, in which there <i>are</i> no lines of code
            that could be affected following any <tt>TABLE</tt>?<br>

            There are many such cases — generally (or always) involving
            <tt>TABLE 1</tt> — in AS-512 source code.&nbsp; I think that
            the <tt>TABLE</tt> directives are being used here only as a
            convenient way to define symbolic labels (<tt>C.NI</tt>, <tt>C.TCV</tt>,
            and so on) without allocating any memory for them and
            without necessarily understanding what was eventually going
            to occupy those locations; those symbolic labels are then
            used throughout the source code with pseudo-ops like <tt>DOG</tt>
            or instructions like <tt>CDS</tt> to select a data-memory
            sector, but not with instructions (like <tt>CLA</tt> or <tt>STO</tt>)
            that would expect them to specify a unique memory
            location.&nbsp; And as I said, <tt>TABLE</tt> does not
            advance the assembler's internal memory pointers, so in this
            example, labels <tt>C.NI</tt> through <tt>C.NZ</tt> all
            refer to the same memory location (and hence the same memory
            sector).<br>

          <td valign="top">The existence of this assembler directive is
            somewhat speculative, because by its very nature it does not
            appear in assembly listings (which are presently our only
            source material for LVDC source code).&nbsp; However, there
            is circumstantial evidence that <i>some</i> assembler
            directive of this nature was used, and my personal suspicion
            is that it was <tt>TITLE</tt>.&nbsp; My description here
            relies on contemporary manuals for IBM 360 Basic Assembly
            Language (BAL).<br>
            <br>
            For the original LVDC assembler, the <tt>TITLE</tt>
            directive simultaneously performed two separate functions:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>It set the title printed in the headings at the tops
                of the printed pages of the assembly listing.&nbsp; The
                new title took effect only on the <i>next</i> printed
                page (and subsequent).<br>
              </li>
              <li>It performed a page feed to move to the top of the
                next printed page.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note that because of the way the modern assembler
              advances to the next "page" only when encountering
              so-called modern comments of the form "<tt># PAGE <i>nnn</i></tt>",







































              <tt>TITLE</tt> directives must appear <i>before</i> those
              comments.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Note that the <tt>TITLE</tt> line itself was not printed
              in the assembly listing.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Single-quotes and ampersands appearing within the title <tt><i>string</i></tt>
              must be treated specially.&nbsp; A single-quote character
              must appear as two single-quotes in succession, and
              similarly an ampersand must appear as two ampersands in
              succession.&nbsp; For example, if the new title was
              supposed to be<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <div align="left">THIS IS MY TITLE &amp; IT'S A VERY GOOD
                ONE<br>
              </div>
            </blockquote>
            <div align="left">
              <div align="left">then the appropriate directive would be<br>
                <blockquote><tt>TITLE 'THIS IS MY TITLE &amp;&amp; IT''S
                    A VERY GOOD ONE'</tt><br>

                Note that assembly listings as output by the modern LVDC
                assembler do not really have "pages" as such, other than
                for the purpose of documenting the correspondence to the
                original program listing, because the days when
                programmers pored over 1000+ page printouts on paper is
                now long past.&nbsp; Therefore, the modern LVDC
                assembler effectively ignores <tt>TITLE</tt>

              Normally, instructions are assembled at successive offset
              locations while the "syllable" (0 or 1) is kept
              fixed.&nbsp; I.e., normally, all of the locations with
              syllable 0 are used up, then all of the locations with
              syllable 1.&nbsp; The assembler uses the <tt><i>IM</i>,<i>IS</i>,<i>S</i>,<i>LOC</i></tt>
              fields from <tt>ORGDD</tt> to determine the memory area
              in which this happens.&nbsp; When the end of the memory
              sector is reached, a different syllable or sector or
              module must be selected either by the assembler or the
              coder.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>

              is typically a full word of memory rather than a single

              or <tt>BSS</tt> aren't used.&nbsp; There are two changes
              from <tt>USE INST</tt> in the way instructions are
              assembled.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>

              beyond that, successive instructions are not assembled
              into the same syllable of memory, but are instead
              assembled at alternating syllables: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0,

              I'm not sure how the CPU responds to this ordering.&nbsp;
              The <tt>USE DAT</tt> context is often (though not always)
              associated with simplex memory configuration as selected

              the order in which the CPU executes instructions in a

          <td valign="top"><tt><a name="Workarounds"></a>WORK</tt> is an
            assembler directive I've introduced, not present in the
            original LVDC assembly language.&nbsp; While none of the
            workarounds defined by <tt>WORK</tt> affect correctness of
            the generated object code, they can affect whether or not
            the generated object code is a 100% match to the object code
            generated by the original assembler.&nbsp; In the end, very
            few <tt>WORK</tt> directives end up needing to be added to
            the LVDC source code, less than 5 per LVDC program
            (depending on the assembler's command-line switches).<br>
            <br>
            I hope they're a temporary addition, and that any <tt>WORK</tt>
            directives added to the source code can eventually be backed
            out, and hopefully <i>sooner</i> rather than later.&nbsp;
            Basically, they're there to help me diagnose internal
            changes in the original assembler (between the AS-206RAM
            time-frame and the AS-513 time-frame).<br>
            <br>
            Here are the presently-defined workarounds, and descriptions
            of the assembly problems they relate to:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><tt>WORK </tt><tt>ROOF</tt><tt><i><tt>,</tt>IM</i>,<i>IS</i>,<i>S</i>,<i>LOC</i></tt>
                — (Note that the word <tt>ROOF</tt> is literal.&nbsp;
                All of the other fields are octal.)&nbsp; This tells the
                assembler that when at the precise address <i><tt>IM-IS-S-LOC</tt></i>,
                in evaluating the amount of free memory remaining in the
                sector, it should reduce that amount by 1.&nbsp; The net
                result of the workaround is that if the assembler would
                otherwise have inserted a sector change after the
                instruction at that address, it instead inserts it
                before that address.&nbsp; <tt>WORK ROOF</tt> has the
                side-effect of filling the succeeding location where the
                sector change would otherwise have been, namely <i><tt>IM</tt></i>-<tt><i>IS</i></tt>-<i><tt>S</tt></i>-<tt>(<i>LOC</i>+1)</tt>,
                with 00000 if it's otherwise unallocated.&nbsp; This
                mimics what I think was a bug in the original LVDC
                assembler.&nbsp; I'm forced to admit, on the other hand,
                that assuming this bug in the original assembler is a
                pretty big inference 50 years afterward from a single
                observed anomaly in the assembler's behavior!</li>
              <li><tt>WORK </tt><tt>FLOOR</tt><tt><i><tt>,</tt>IM</i>,<i>IS</i>,<i>S</i>,<i>LOC</i></tt>
                — (Note that the word <tt>FLOOR</tt> is literal.&nbsp;
                All of the other fields are octal.)&nbsp; This basically
                is the reverse of <tt>WORK ROOF</tt>, and tells the
                assembler that at the precise address <i><tt>IM-IS-S-LOC</tt></i>,
                it should pretend that the amount of free memory is 1
                greater than what it actually measures.&nbsp; This
                subterfuge is a workaround for the case of a <tt>TNZ <i>SYMBOL</i></tt>
                or <tt>TMI <i>SYMBOL</i></tt> appearing in syllable 0,
                but with <tt><i>SYMBOL</i></tt> itself appearing in
                syllable 1 of the same sector.&nbsp; Without the <tt>WORK</tt>
                directive, the modern assembler may insert an automatic
                sector change 1 instruction earlier than the original
                assembler would have.&nbsp; This <tt>WORK</tt>
                directive may be used multiple times at the same address
                to increase the effect.<br>
              </li>
              <li><tt>WORK </tt><tt>BLOCK</tt><tt><i><tt>,</tt>IM</i>,<i>IS</i>,<i>S</i>,<i>LOC</i></tt>
                — (Note that the word <tt>BLOCK</tt> is literal.&nbsp;
                All of the other fields are octal.)&nbsp; Suppresses
                insertion of an automatic sector change prior to a <tt>BLOCK</tt>
                at the selected address.<br>
              </li>
              <li><tt>WORK </tt><tt><tt>INC</tt></tt><tt><tt>,</tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS</i>,<i>D</i><i>LOC</i></tt>
                — (Note that the word <tt>INC</tt> is literal.&nbsp;
                All of the other fields are octal.) This tells the
                assembler to increment by 1 the constant at address <i><tt>DM-DS-DLOC</tt></i>.&nbsp;








































                Technically, it's actually incremented by 2, since the
                least-significant bit in any memory word is reserved for
                the parity bit.&nbsp; <br>
              </li>
              <li><tt>WORK </tt><tt><tt>DEC</tt></tt><tt><tt>,</tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS</i>,<i>D</i><i>LOC</i></tt>
                — (Note that the word <tt><tt>DEC</tt></tt> is
                literal.&nbsp; All of the other fields are octal.) Same
                as <tt>WORK INC</tt>, but decrements by 1 (2) instead
                of incrementing.</li>
              <li><tt>WORK CDS,<i>SYMBOL</i></tt> — (Note that the word
                <tt>CDS</tt> is literal, and that <i><tt>SYMBOL</tt></i>
                is a string.)&nbsp; In order to duplicate behavior of
                the original assembler, there are some cases in which
                the assembler needs to know that a <tt>CDS</tt>
                instruction appears at a memory location associated with
                a <i><tt>SYMBOL</tt></i>.&nbsp; Usually it can figure
                that out quite easily, but if the <tt><i>SYMBOL</i></tt>
                happens to be defined by <tt>SYN *INS</tt>, I haven't
                yet quite figured out how to do that.&nbsp; This
                workaround supplies the information.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a debugging measure (vs a semi-permanent fix), using
              the LVDC assembler's <tt>--fuzzy</tt> command-line switch
              may be more useful than adding <tt>WORK INC</tt> and <tt>WORK








































                DEC</tt> directives to the LVDC source code, because <tt>--fuzzy</tt>
              has the effect of categorizing ±1 mismatches separately
              from other mismatches, produces more-useful messages, and
              is easier to do.&nbsp; On the other hand, it conceivably
              could also conceal some non-rounding octal mismatches.<br>

    <p>Sector shifts in the program flow:&nbsp; Recall that each 26-bit
      word of memory (not including the parity bit) consists of two
      13-bit syllables, referred to as syllable 0 and syllable 1.&nbsp;
      Each CPU instruction assembles to a single 13-bit value, and thus
      fits precisely within a single syllable, and any word in memory
      can simultaneously hold two separate instructions.&nbsp; When the
      CPU executes code in a given memory sector, it just sequences
      through all of the instructions in the currently-selected
      syllable.&nbsp; When the last-available word in the current
      syllable is reached, execution cannot continue.&nbsp; Rather than
      forcing the programmer to deal with this situation explicitly, the
      assembler steps in and transparently substitutes an extra
      instruction into the program flow to select a different syllable,
      sector, or module.&nbsp; So from the programmer's standpoint, he
      can just write an uninterrupted block of code without even
      worrying about the fact that it spans several different memory
      sectors.&nbsp; The code transparently modified by the assembler
      uses slightly more memory and execution time that it superficially
      appears to from the source code, but that <i>usually</i> doesn't
      matter.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>From the assembler's point of view, though, it's a bit more
      complicated.&nbsp; The simplest case is in reaching the end of
      syllable 0 for a given memory sector.&nbsp; The first (unused)
      location of syllable 1 of that same memory sector is accessible by
      a <tt>TRA</tt> instruction, so the assembler transparently
      inserts a <tt>TRA</tt> just before reaching the end of syllable
      0.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What happens when reaching the end of syllable 1 of a memory
      sector is much trickier.&nbsp; For one thing, various factors
      influence the usage of words at the ends of sectors in syllable 1,
      so it's a chore for the assembler just to figure out when the end
      of sector 1 has even been reached.&nbsp; The next problem is that
      once the end of syllable 1 has been reached, it can't simply
      switch to a new syllable:&nbsp; it instead has to switch to a
      different <i>sector</i> within the memory module, or perhaps even
      to a different memory module altogether.&nbsp; That can't be done
      with a simple <tt>TRA</tt> instruction, and requires a
      more-complex <tt>HOP</tt> instruction instead.&nbsp; Unlike a <tt>TRA</tt>
      instruction which encodes its target address within the
      instruction itself, a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction requires a
      variable containing the "HOP constant" of the target
      address.&nbsp; Naturally, no such variable containing the desired
      HOP constant normally exists.&nbsp; So in order to insert a <tt>HOP</tt>
      instruction, the assembler must first create such a
      variable:&nbsp; it must find an unused location in the current
      data sector or residual sector, and stick a HOP constant into it.</p>
    Those points at which a sector change is performed due to reaching
    the end of the sector, regardless of whether or not the assembler
    inserts any <tt>HOP</tt> or <tt>TRA</tt> instructions, is marked
    with a <tt>*</tt> in column 1 of the assembly listing.&nbsp; These
    transparently-inserted jumps are found at the following
    card-sequence numbers in the AS-206RAM listing:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>044700 047910 050170 052790 054910 057850 062640 065020

    <p>Assembly errors:&nbsp; Errors are marked in the leftmost column
      of the offending line by a character that presumably indicates the
      type of error.&nbsp; In the AS-206RAM assembly listing, the 7 such
      errors are found, and here are my interpretations of what they
      mean:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>U</tt> at sequence number 027140.&nbsp; The operand, <tt>CBNAV</tt>,
        is not a defined symbol.&nbsp; It appears as though it was
        probably correct in earlier software versions, but perhaps
        should have been changed to <tt>CBNAV1</tt> in this version.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>U</tt> at sequence number 029650.&nbsp; One of the macro
        parameters, <tt>CBRANW</tt>, is not a defined symbol.&nbsp;
        There is a handwritten note implying that it probably should
        have been <tt>TEMP6</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>O</tt> (no sequence number, p. 67).&nbsp; This is a
        full-line comment, but the necessary "<tt>*</tt>" character in
        column 1 has apparently been accidentally omitted.&nbsp;
        Therefore, the first word in the line (which happens to be "+")
        has been interpreted as an instruction, and naturally the
        assembler knows of no such instruction. <br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>V</tt> at sequence number 047930.&nbsp; The assembler
        mistakenly believes the target location, <tt>*-2</tt>,&nbsp; is
        out of range, because it has been fooled by an automatic switch
        from memory syllable 0 to syllable 1 slightly before.&nbsp; In
        fact, the target location actually <i>is</i> accessible by a <tt>TRA</tt>
        instruction (or a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction), but presumably the
        original assembler was not smart enough to figure that out.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>U</tt> (no sequence number, p. 187). The target location,
        <tt>TB5GO</tt>, is an undefined symbol.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>A</tt> (no sequence number, p. 188). The target variable,
        <tt>TBB</tt>, is defined, but is not located in either the
        current data sector or in the residual sector, and is therefore
        not accessible.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>O</tt> (no sequence number, p. 190). The target location
        of a jump, <tt>ORBGID</tt>, is not located in the current data
        sector.&nbsp; The instruction is <tt>TRA</tt>, and ordinarily
        that means that the assembler would automatically have used a <tt>HOP</tt>
        instruction in place of the <tt>TRA</tt>. For reasons that are
        unclear to me, the original assembler did not do so in this
        case, and instead simply discarded the instruction.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice that about half of the errors above occur on the (rare!)
      lines having no card-sequence number.&nbsp; I think that for
      pragmatic reasons, sequence numbers would usually have been left
      off of the punch-cards while the code was under development.&nbsp;
      Otherwise, they would have needed to be changed frequently, which
      would be a great inconvenience.&nbsp; In other words, the sequence
      numbers were likely only added once the code had reached a
      releasable form.&nbsp; Thus most of the errors appeared in areas
      of the code that were under active development, which is not
      terribly surprising.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Alas!&nbsp; There are 7 <i>more</i> errors exactly like the <tt>A</tt>
      type error listed above which the original assembler did not even
      detect.&nbsp; These are the pairs of lines of code at
      card-sequence numbers 026840, 026860, 026880, 026900, 026920,
      026940, and 026960.&nbsp; They're all of the form<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt><i>LABEL</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>CONSTANT</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <i>CONSTANT</i>+1<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Fortunately, it's easy to see how these latter 7 errors should be
      fixed.&nbsp; As it happens, there are quite a few examples on the
      same page of the assembly listing that make it clear the pattern
      should have instead been <br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt><i>LABEL</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; CDS &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>CONSTANT</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Consider a "normal" section of the listing, containing code,
    comments, etc., as opposed to report tables generated by the
    assembler, to which I've added some markup (in green) for
    explanatory purposes:<br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="anatomyCode.jpg" width="1005"
        height="310"> </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Columns IM, IS, S, LOC, DM, and DS:&nbsp; These columns are
        generated by the assembler and represent <a
          href="#Layout_of_Memory_Words">the fields of the HOP constant</a>
        associated with the line of code, from the viewpoint of the
        assembler.&nbsp; (The only HOP fields missing are DUPIN and
        DUPDN, which I suppose would be global settings affecting all
        memory, as opposed to varying on a line by line basis.)&nbsp; In
        particular, the IM and IS fields give the memory module and
        sector in which the line of code appears, and LOC gives the
        offset into the memory sector of the word in which the code for
        the instruction is stored.</li>
      <li>Columns A8-A1, A9, and OP:&nbsp; These columns are also
        generated by the assembler, and represent <a
          href="#Layout_of_Memory_Words">fields of the assembled
          instruction</a> associated with the line of code.&nbsp; In
        particular, OP is the octal value of the particular CPU
        instruction, <a href="#CPU_Instructions">as tabulated earlier</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Column CONSTANT:&nbsp; Yet another field generated by the
        assembler.&nbsp; Most lines don't have it, but it appears
        whenever the operand of the instruction is the address of a
        numerical constant stored at some other place in memory, but for
        which the assembler knows the value.&nbsp; For example, both of
        the lines in the sample above are the same, 342452244, because
        both of them relate to a <tt>HOP SCPOLY</tt> instruction.&nbsp;
        As I've already explained above, what the assembler does with a
        line of code like this is to find the <tt>SCPOLY</tt> routine
        (which conveniently for us, actually appears in sample above as
        well), figures out its HOP constant, allocates a word of memory,
        stores the HOP constant at that location, and then embeds the
        address of that location into the instruction.&nbsp; You can
        actually see all that happening in the sample.&nbsp; The HOP
        constant itself corresponds to the values IM=4, IS=04, S=1,
        LOC=124, DM=2, DS=14 at the line of code <tt>SCPOLY STO 777</tt>.&nbsp;








































































































































































        I know it's probably tough to do those conversions in your head,
        so a handy python script (<a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaASM.py/unHOP.py">unHOP.py</a>)
        is available that can do it for you; and in fact, if you feed
        342452244 into unHOP.py, the expected values of IM, IS, S, etc.,
        pop out.&nbsp; (You also get the extra info that DUPIN=1 and
        DUPDN=1 ... more on which below.)&nbsp; Moreover, if you look at
        the lines where the constant appears, namely the lines reading
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <tt>HOP SCPOLY</tt>, and you look at the assembled code, you'll
        see that the address at which the HOP constant is stored must be
        DM=2, DS=14, LOC=342.</li>
      <li>Column EXPANSION:&nbsp; The final field generated by the
        assembler.&nbsp; It contains the character '+' for instructions
        which have been expanded from the <tt>CALL</tt> macro, but is
        blank otherwise.&nbsp; Whether there are other things that can
        appear there, I can't say.</li>
      <li>Columns LEFT-HAND SYMBOL, INSTRUCTION, OPERAND, COMMENT,
        SEQUENCE:&nbsp; I've covered these above, and suspect that they
        may come directly from the punch cards, unchanged.</li>
    </ul>
    The Segment Cross Reference table:&nbsp; This appears near the end
    of the assembly listing, and is generated by the assembler.&nbsp;
    Here's a small sample:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="anatomyXref.jpg" width="1328"
        height="74"><br>
    </div>
    <p>What the cross reference does is list each symbol in the program,
      tell you where it appears in memory, and then tells you how to
      find all <i>uses</i> of that symbol in the code.&nbsp; It should
      be pretty obvious to you that in this example, the symbol <tt>UTEMP1</tt>
      is in memory module 2, sector 17, at address 174.&nbsp; It may or
      may not be obvious that where the symbol is <i>used</i> is at the
      line SEQUENCE numbers 085370, 116640, etc.&nbsp; Alas, the few
      pages of the assembly listing which I've elected to freely expose
      do not include the one which <tt>UTEMP1</tt> is allocated, but
      does include several examples of where it is used.&nbsp; For
      example, if you look at the sample code I've marked up in green
      just a bit above, you can see it used at SEQUENCE number 117600,
      just as expected.&nbsp; Not all lines of code have SEQUENCE
      numbers, and in those cases the SEQUENCE number appearing in the
      table are generated by simply adding 10 to last card having an
      explicit SEQUENCE number.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Although I haven't shown any examples in the image above, memory
      locations which the assembler itself automatically allocates also
      appear in the segment cross reference table.&nbsp; Recall that
      there are cases where the assembler transparently allocates memory
      locations to store values of constants (like the values of
      numerical expressions or HOP constants) which are referenced
      on-the-fly without being explicitly defined in the source
      code.&nbsp; These variables are distinguished by having no
      symbolic name.&nbsp; Instead they are referenced by their unique
      values rather than by symbolic name.&nbsp; I.e., their unique
      values are used as if they were their symbolic names.&nbsp; Hence
      what appears in the table in place of a name is the 9-octal-digit
      value stored at the location.&nbsp; They appear in the table after
      all of the symbolic names.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The octal listing of the program:&nbsp; This is generated by the
      assembler and appears at the very end of the listing.&nbsp; It
      simply shows what appears at each memory location in the modules,
      as either a single 26-bit octal word or as two 13-bit
      syllables.&nbsp; So you can see in the octal table what each
      instruction and each pseudo-op assembles to in octal form.&nbsp;
      In each of the numbered columns of the table, syllable 1 of the
      memory word is on the left and syllable 0 is on the right.&nbsp;
      For example, referring to the image below, in module 2, sector 00,
      location 0201 (or 2-00-0201 for short), syllable 1 has the value
      10170 and syllable 0 has the value 00174.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>It's important to understand the alignment of the data shown in
      the octal listing:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>26-bit data words (none of which are shown below) are shifted
        1 bit to the left, and thus displayed as 9 octal digits.&nbsp;
        The least-significant bit is always 0.</li>
      <li>13-bit instructions, syllable 1, are shifted 2 bits to the
        left, and thus displayed as 5 octal digits.&nbsp; The
        least-significant 2 bits are always 0.</li>
      <li>13-bit instructions, syllable 0, are shifted 1 bit to the
        left, and thus displayed as 5 octal digits.&nbsp; The
        most-significant and least-significant bit are always 0.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This seems weird — the instruction alignment in particular! — but
      I suppose the rationale is that the open bit positions correspond
      to the positions of parity bits.&nbsp; The assembler itself does
      not bother to compute the parity bits for you, and thus represents
      them all as 0.&nbsp; If you take an instruction from syllable 1
      and one from syllable 0 as shown in the table, overlap the
      least-significant <i>octal digit</i> from the left-hand
      instruction with the most-significant octal digit from the
      right-hand instruction, then bitwise OR them (or add them), you
      get the full contents of the memory word.&nbsp; For example,
      taking the first two instructions shown below (63224 12436), the
      full 26-bit content of address 2-00-000, left-aligned, is:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>&nbsp; 63224<br>
        +&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12436</u><br>
        &nbsp; 632252436<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <p>However, there's no doubt that the visual representation of this
      data is undoubtedly weird.&nbsp; And, it's unclear just how useful
      it is ... certainly not at all, if you're trying to disassemble
      the instructions by eye!&nbsp; I've provided a handy python script
      (<a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaASM.py/unOP.py">unOP.py</a>)
      that you can use to provide a simple-minded disassembly of the
      instructions found in the octal listing.&nbsp; The script assumes
      that if an octal number you give it has a leading space character
      then it is in syllable 0, and that if it has no leading space it
      is in syllable l.&nbsp; For example, feeding "63224" into it gives
      back "MPH 315", while feeding " 12436" into it gives back "CLA
      124".<br>

    <h2><a name="MIT_Instrumentation_Laboratory_vs_IBM"></a>MIT
      Instrumentation Laboratory vs IBM Federal Systems Division</h2>
    The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (which designed the Apollo
    Guidance Computer) had nothing to do with the LVDC, and conversely
    IBM Federal Systems Division (which designed the LVDC) had nothing
    to do with the AGC.&nbsp; However, since IBM was an important
    manufacturer of computers (indeed, it designed the Gemini on-board
    computer system), whereas MIT/IL was emphatically <i>not</i>, there
    was an understandable feeling by some that the Apollo program might
    better be served by an IBM on-board guidance computer in the Command
    Module and Lunar Module than by newly-designed computer from novice
    MIT/IL.<br>
    <br>
    Accordingly, IBM proposed that the LVDC be used in place of the AGC
    in the CM and LM, and in 1963, it produced a big, two-volume report
    (<a href="Documents/IBMStudyReport-63-928-129-Volume1.pdf">here</a>
    and <a href="Documents/IBMStudyReport-63-928-130-Volume2.pdf"> here</a>)
    to support their proposal.&nbsp; The Instrumentation Labs fired back
    their own critiques, shredding IBM's report to the extent
    possible.&nbsp; And in <a
      href="Documents/CritiqueOfIBMApolloStudyReport.pdf"> one of those
      critiques</a>, we have a few snippets of LVDC assembly language,
    as written by the Instrumentation Labs personnel rather than by IBM.
    Perhaps I'm making too much of this sample code, but for years and
    years it was the only purported LVDC code we had any access to, and
    as the only LVDC code then thought still to exist, perhaps over the
    span of a decade or so it used up more of my mind share than it
    deserved in retrospect.<br>
    <br>
    Whether it's good LVDC code or bad LVDC code, who knows?&nbsp; I can
    tell you that it would certainly bomb out when run through our
    modern assembler, and presumably would do so when run through IBM's
    original one ... so it's very unlikely that the good folks at MIT/IL
    had any access either to the original IBM assembler, or even to any
    samples of IBM-written source code.&nbsp; They were either using
    their imaginations, or perhaps wrote their own assembler for it,
    using their own home-grown syntax.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; [<b>Note:</b>
    Actually <i>I</i> know, because I've since been told by Hugh
    Blair-Smith that that MIT/IL merely had enough documentation at that
    time to understand how the various LVDC instructions worked at the
    machine level, but hadn't any information at all about syntax,
    pseudo-ops, or the various convenience features of IBM's LVDC
    assembler.&nbsp; They had no assembler for it.]&nbsp; Perhaps some
    day I'll go through it and fix up the syntax enough to run it
    through the assembler and emulator.<br>
    <br>
    Whether or not it's good code, here's what it looked like.&nbsp; The
    '#' characters indicate the beginnings of comments, and as usual,
    were added by me rather then originally being present in the sample
    code.<br>

          LVDC/PTC CPU Emulation</big></small></h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"><i>The LVDC/PTC CPU emulator is a
          work in progress, so the information in this section may not
          yet be totally reliable.</i><br>
        <br>
        An important proviso regarding CPU emulation is that the
        original physical LVDCs installed in the Saturn rockets were not
        by themselves fast enough to keep up with the real-time
        calculations needed to directly control the rocket.&nbsp; The
        LVDC could only update the control signals it was outputting
        about 25 times a second ... and while that may <i>seem</i>
        fast, it's not fast enough when you're controlling a powerful
        beast like the Saturn V rocket.&nbsp; The control signals output
        by the LVDC if used directly, as is, would have been too
        stair-steppy, too choppy.&nbsp; 25 outputs per second isn't
        enough!&nbsp; So the LVDC's output signals didn't directly
        control the rocket.&nbsp; What happened instead is that a
        separate unit — the LVD<i>A</i> — was needed to accept the
        digital outputs from the LVDC and turn them into
        smoothly-changing controls for the rocket. And when I say
        smoothly-changing, I mean both smoothly in <i>time</i> as well
        as in terms of electrical properties. Thus any emulation of the
        LVDC that could acceptably control the rocket would additionally
        require emulation of the LVDA.&nbsp; But the yaLVDC program does
        <i>not</i> do that; it emulates the LVDC and nothing more!&nbsp;
        If you want to emulate the LVDA or anything else connected to
        the LVDC, additional emulation software is needed beyond just
        yaLVDC.<br>
        <br>
        Another interesting aspect of the LVDC is that since it was
        essentially a "black box" that output real-time control signals
        in response to real-time inputs, it is possible to create a
        reasonably satisfactory behavioral simulation for it in the
        absence of the original software, since we know the <a
          href="Documents/SaturnVLaunchVehicleGuidanceEquations.pdf">
          guidance equations</a> relating the outputs to the
        inputs.&nbsp; The yaLVDC software does <i>not</i> do that; it
        emulates the LVDC or PTC CPU, whether you have loaded into it
        any LVDC software that implements the guidance equations or
        not.&nbsp; Perhaps all you load into the emulation is something

        that said, while creating behavior simulations is not an
        objective of the Virtual AGC project as far as the Apollo CPUs
        are concerned, there are people engaged in creating such
        simulations for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span>

    The yaLVDC program currently has to be build from its <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaLVDC">source




























































































      code</a>.&nbsp; Building it requires the GNU C compiler ("gcc")
    and the GNU "make" program.&nbsp; Simply download the source code,
    "cd" into the folder containing it (which is the "yaLVDC" folder in
    the Virtual AGC software repository), and run the command
    "make".&nbsp; You should then add yaLVDC to your PATH, so that it
    can be easily found later by the operating system.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b> In this section, I'm
        discussing our emulated LVDC CPU in <i>isolation</i>.&nbsp; By
        that I mean that I'm talking about it as a stand-alone item,
        irrespective of any other emulations of the peripheral equipment
        that also need to be present to have a fully useful
        simulation.&nbsp; The yaLVDC program uses a technique I refer to
        as "virtual wiring" to connect to other emulated devices.&nbsp;
        The principal resource on such "virtual wiring" is our <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/developer.html">Developer
          Page</a>, and although that page discusses the matter largely
        within the context of the AGC and its peripherals, that same
        principles apply to the AGS and its peripherals, and to the case
        of interest to us, the LVDC and <i>its</i> peripherals.&nbsp;
        In brief, the emulated CPU and its peripherals form a
        client/server system, with the CPU being the server and the
        peripherals being the clients.&nbsp; The clients connect to the
        emulated CPU via TCP "ports".&nbsp; Signals that would normally
        pass between a physical LVDC and its peripherals via physical
        wires, instead pass digitally between server and client.&nbsp;
        In the case of the LVDC, those signals are explicitly emitted
        and received via the </font><font size="-1"><tt>PIO</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> instruction, and are implicitly emitted and received
        (for signals having no direct control by the software) using
        what you might call "fictitious" </font><font size="-1"><tt>PIO</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> channels not ordinarily used for any other
        purpose.&nbsp; But these are facts you can essentially ignore
        for the moment.</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    In order to run an LVDC or PTC emulation, you first have have some
    LVDC or PTC software to load into it, and that LVDC/PTC software
    must have been assembled by <a
      href="#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">the yaASM.py assembler
      which is covered in the next section</a>.&nbsp; In any given
    assembly, the assembler produces 3 output files which are required
    as input to yaLVDC.&nbsp; These are called yaASM.tsv (the octal
    listing of the initial memory contents), yaASM.sym (the symbol
    table), and yaASM.src (the source code, as related to specific
    memory locations and source-code line numbers).&nbsp; These files
    can be moved to any folder you like, and renamed anything you like,
    as long as they retain the extensions .tsv, .sym, and .src.<br>
    <br>
    You invoke the LVDC/PTC emulator with the command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaLVDC [<i>OPTIONS</i>] --assembly=<i>path/to/the/LVDC/or/PTC/executable</i></tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    For example, you might already be in the folder containing PTC
    executables (which perhaps you've renamed PAST.tsv, PAST.sym, and
    PAST.src), and yaLVDC might be in your PATH, and the command might
    be<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaLVDC --ptc --cold-start --assembly=PAST</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Here's a list of the <tt><i>OPTIONS</i></tt> available right now,
    though using the command "yaLVDC --help" might give a more
    up-to-date list.<br>

            executable files output by the assembler, and if those were
            in the current folder, it would just be <tt>--assembly=yaASM</tt>.&nbsp;




























































































            Or if you had renamed them (say) MyProgram.tsv,

            (Note that on Linux or MacOs, the forward-slash character

            <br>
            Multiple <tt>--assembly</tt> switches are allowed on a
            single yaLVDC command line, allowing simultaneous loading of
            separately assembled program components at nonoverlapping
            locations in memory.&nbsp; This is necessary because (as
            described above) the LVDC Flight Program did not completely
            fill memory, and required the presence of other programs
            (such as the Preflight Program) to function properly.&nbsp;
            The PTC ADAPT Self Test Program, on the other hand is
            complete and relies on no other software.<br>

            would generally be used with <tt>--run</tt>, or not at
            all.&nbsp; The explanation is that while LVDC emulations
            have a single debugger, namely the gdb-based one built
            natively into yaLVDC, PTC emulations instead have two
            debuggers that are essentially separate an
            independent.&nbsp; The first of these is still yaLVDC's
            native debugger, but the second one is based instead on the
            PTC front panel.&nbsp; While the two debuggers can be used
            at the same time, to a certain extent, they are not designed
            to do so.&nbsp; Normally, therefore, when using PTC
            front-panel based debugging, one would let the emulation
            free-run from the yaLVDC debugger's point of view, so the
            command-line switches <tt>--run --panel-paused</tt> would
            be used together.&nbsp; Conversely, when using yaLVDC based
            debugging, one would let the CPU run freely from the PTC
            panel's point of view, and thus neither of those
            command-line switches would be used.<br>

    As mentioned above, by default the emulation runs in a debugging
    interface intended to allow you do things like single-step the
    LVDC/PTC software, set breakpoints, examine or change memory or
    registers, etc.&nbsp; The interface is loosely based on the GNU "<a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a>" debugger, but is
    a limited form of it.&nbsp; Once yaLVDC is running, but the
    emulation is halted at a debugger command line, you can get a
    complete list of the available debugger commands with the the
    command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>HELP<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    Some useful commands you'll read about there are <tt>STEP</tt>
    (single-step some number of instructions), <tt>NEXT</tt> (single
    step instructions, but executing subroutines as indivisible blocks
    without seeming to descend into them), <tt>BREAK</tt> (set
    breakpoint), <tt>X</tt> (examine memory), <tt>SET</tt> (change
    memory contents), <tt>BACKTRACE</tt> (list the jumps that got us to
    the present point in the program), and so on.&nbsp; yaLVDC does not
    presently have the ability to be embedded within GUI debuggers such
    as Code::Blocks, but hopefully someday it might.<br>
    <br>
    When the PAST program is being emulated (as opposed to an LVDC
    flight program), the <tt>x</tt> command (examine memory) is
    particularly useful when applied to the 50-word table at label <tt>ERR</tt>,
    the command for which is:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>X/50 &amp;ERR</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    This table is a record of the last 10 self-test failures which have
    occurred.&nbsp; Each of the failures contributes 5 successive words
    in the table, obviously, and the 5 words are interpreted as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The current value of the program pass counter.</li>
      <li>A HOP constant referencing an individual test or block of
        tests.&nbsp; This is the beginning of the block of code
        containing the test, and not the specific point in the code
        where the error occurred.&nbsp; In the debugger, you can change
        the program counter (and data sector) directly to the referenced
        block of code with the command <tt>GOTO <i>HopConstant</i></tt>,
        though in doing so, you won't be restoring any other aspect of
        the the machine state to what it was at the time the error
        occurred.</li>
      <li>The contents of the accumulator at the time the error was
        detected.</li>
      <li>A HOP constant referencing an individual test. Used when word
        #2 above refers to a block of several tests. <br>
      </li>
      <li>A data word defining an individual test. Used when a
        subroutine is performing several tests with a block of test data
        and test patterns.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote> </blockquote>
    <i>A general example:</i> Let's the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program
    without any emulated peripheral devices, thus being dependent on the
    built-in yaLVDC debugger.&nbsp; Assuming you had copied the
    assembler's output files (yaASM.tsv, yaASM.src, and yaASM.sym; see
    the next section) into the folder containing yaLVDC, you'd start the
    program something like this:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="left"><tt>./yaLVDC --ptc --cold-start --assembly=yaASM</tt><br>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    yaLVDC starts up and then pauses prior to emulating the very first
    instruction in the PAST program, giving you a "debugger" interface
    that may be something like this:<br>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;<tt>HOP = 000000000

    <p>What this is trying to do is to compactly display a lot of info
      about the state of the CPU and of the emulation itself:<br>
    </p>

        instruction module 0, instruction sector 00, syllable 0,
        location 000), with a "HOP constant" of 000000000. </li>
      <li>The data context (for fetching or saving variables in memory)
        is 0-00 (i.e., data module 0, data sector 00).</li>
      <li>The value stored at the code address (i.e., the numerical
        representation of the next instruction to be emulated) is 01037<sub>8</sub>.</li>
      <li>The value stored in the accumulator is 0.</li>
      <li>The memory locations often designated as 777 and 776, used to
        store return addresses of subroutines, are currently empty;
        i.e., nothing has yet been stored in them.</li>
      <li>"RET" refers to the so-called "HOP save" register, which
        currently is 0-00-0-000 (code) and 0-00 (data).&nbsp; The HOP
        save register contains the code address and data context of the
        instruction in memory that immediately follows the last
        instruction that was executed.&nbsp; In other words, usually
        this will just be the same as the current code address and data
        context.&nbsp; But if the previously-executed instruction sas a
        <tt>HOP</tt>, <tt>TRA</tt>, <tt>TNZ</tt>, or <tt>TMI</tt>,
        and thus the current instruction was out of order with the last
        one executed, then the HOP save register will differ from the
        current HOP constant.&nbsp; So in that case, the HOP save
        register is basically the return address from the immediately
        preceding <tt>HOP</tt>, <tt>TRA</tt>, <tt>TNZ</tt>, or <tt>TMI</tt>.&nbsp;





















































































        The program then must immediately use a <tt>STO 777</tt> or <tt>STO





















































































          776</tt> to save the return address, or else the information
        is permanently lost.</li>
      <li>So far (suprise!), 0 instructions have been executed, 0
        instruction cycles have elapsed, and that has taken 0 seconds of
        real time.</li>
      <li>The current address corresponds to source-code line
        #369.&nbsp; However, the line numbers shown do not relate to
        line numbers in the PAST program source file
        (PTC-ADAPT-Self-Test-Program.lvdc8), but rather to the line
        numbers in the yaASM.src file.&nbsp; That's because the LVDC/PTC
        assembler is a macro assembler, in which a single line of source
        code may sometimes be transparently converted to several
        LVDC/PTC instructions.&nbsp; For example, in the PTC, the
        "instruction" <tt>SHL 25</tt> is really the sequence of
        instructions <tt>SHL 6 / SHL 6 / SHL 6 / SHL 6 / SHL 1</tt>.&nbsp;


























































































        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The source-code line associated with the current memory
        location is "<tt>L1P1 CLA ZERO</tt>".&nbsp; As it happens, all
        LVDC/PTC software is potentially self-modifying, and all of the
        original LVDC/PTC source code at our disposal is actually
        self-modifying.&nbsp; If the instruction value found at the
        current code address is different than the one the debugger
        expected to find, the debugger will show you both the original
        source line and for comparison a source line that it generates
        by disassembling the current instruction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, the final "<tt>&gt;</tt>" is a user-prompt, indicating
      that the debugger is waiting for user input, and as I said above,
      wherever possible those commands are based on gdb.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>So, for instance, if we used the command <tt>LIST</tt>, we'd see
      the following:<br>

    In this case, the original source code has been ignored, but the
    disassembler has recreated a sort of facsimile of it by analyzing
    the contents of memory.&nbsp; That's important, because LVDC/PTC
    code is self-modifying ... i.e., it sometimes replaces the
    instructions originally in memory with different ones.&nbsp; The
    regeneration of the source code by <tt>DISASSEMBLE</tt> is quite
    good, and the disassembly looks much like the original.&nbsp; In
    some ways it's even more useful than the original, though lacking
    comments, since it not only tells you the names of variables, but
    goes out of its way to tell you what values are stored in those
    variables.&nbsp; You do notice a few differences, such as <tt>VAR3</tt>
    in the one vs <tt>V3</tt> in the other.&nbsp; That's because <tt>VAR3</tt>
    and <tt>V3</tt> are <i>synonyms</i> in the original source code
    (via the <tt>SYN</tt> pseudo-op), so the disassembler has no way to
    know which of the two synonyms was originally used ... but it
    doesn't matter.&nbsp; You may also see things that you at first <i>think</i>
    are bugs: for example, at address <tt>0-00-0-017</tt>, you find an
    "<tt>ADD =O000000002</tt>" instruction, for which you're helpfully
    informed that the value stored in memory for <tt>=O000000002</tt>
    is really <tt>000000001</tt>.&nbsp; A discrepancy?&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
    In constructs like <tt>=O000000002</tt> in LVDC/PTC assembly
    language, the 26-bit data is aligned at the most-significant (27th)
    bit when stored in memory, leaving the least-significant bit open
    for storing parity.&nbsp; In other words, from a "modern" point of
    view, they're left-shifted on place from where they ought to
    be.&nbsp; So <tt>=O000000002</tt> is really, logically, the integer
    1.&nbsp; A nice, constant source of confusion!&nbsp;<img

    The original IBM 360 (or IBM 7094) based LVDC assembler used during

    at least, not available to <i>us</i>.&nbsp; So I've written an LVDC
    assembler completely from scratch. <br>
    <br>
    In saying this, I suppose it's important to reiterate that while we
    have decent contemporaneous documentation of the LVDC/PTC
    instruction set, we have no contemporaneous documentation whatsoever
    of the format of LVDC assembly language, and specifically of the
    pseudo-ops or operand syntax of the language.&nbsp; Nor of various
    mysterious things not explicitly related to LVDC source code that
    the assembler does behind the scenes.&nbsp; In other words, while
    the new assembler works with the LVDC/PTC language documentation as
    described on this web page, portions of this web page's
    documentation are based on what I've personally inferred from
    reading the specific LVDC/PTR program printouts available to
    me.&nbsp; <i>Big</i> portions of the documentation.&nbsp; Each new
    listing of a different version of the original LVDC or PTC software
    tends to have features which I've never seen before and which
    therefore are not yet accounted for in the new assembler.<br>

      modern LVDC assembler is called yaASM.py and is available in the
      Virtual AGC software repository</a>.&nbsp; Most of the other
    Python files there are necessary for running the assembler as
    well.&nbsp; As the naming implies, the assembler is written in the
    Python language — specifically Python 3, and it will not work with
    Python 2.&nbsp; Python programs such as this assembler are ready to
    run, as-is, and require no preparation or setup other than
    installation of Python itself.<br>
    <blockquote> <font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; The yaASM.py
        program should not be confused with the yaASM program, which
        also appears in the repository.&nbsp; yaASM is an assembler
        program for Gemini OBC assembly language.&nbsp; The naming of
        these two programs is similar due to the fact that the LVDC and
        OBC are such similar computers.&nbsp; The original intention was
        that yaASM would be able to handle both OBC and LVDC assembly
        languages.&nbsp; However, yaASM was written in advance of any <i>true</i>
        samples of LVDC source code becoming available.&nbsp; When true
        LVDC samples became available much later, the inadequacy of
        yaASM with respect to the language features that it would need
        to handle became apparent, and the idea of using yaASM for the
        LVDC was abandoned.<br>
      </font></blockquote>
    Usage of the LVDC assembler is quite simple on the face of it:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaASM.py [<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<i>OCTALS</i>.tsv] &lt;<i>INPUT</i>.lvdc






























































































        &gt;<i>OUTPUT</i>.lst</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    The filename extension (shown above as ".lvdc") is not
    required.&nbsp; In point of fact, two different file extensions are
    currently in use, ".lvdc" and ".lvdc8".&nbsp; The only difference
    between these two formats is how the transcriber chose to align some
    of the columns.&nbsp; In brief, .lvdc files attempt to align
    everything horizontally in the precise columns of the original
    punch-cards, whereas .lvdc8 files instead aim for the convenience of
    aligning at nearby tab-stops (of width 8).&nbsp; Eventually, we
    expect that all .lvdc8 source files will be converted to .lvdc
    format.&nbsp; The assembler itself is indifferent to these concerns,
    and therefore accepts either format interchangeably. <br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Each available
        version of PTC or LVDC source code is accompanied by a Makefile
        that controls the assembly process (i.e., provides suitable
        command-line switches for the assembler).&nbsp; Therefore,
        studying those Makefiles may be useful.</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    By <i>default</i> the assembler targets the LVDC assembly-language
    features found in the AS-206RAM flight program (1967), so no <tt><i>OPTIONS</i></tt>
    for the assembler are really advisable.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To instead target the PTC (1965), the command-line switch <tt>--ptc</tt>
    is required.&nbsp; The <tt>--past-bugs</tt> switch may also be
    desirable, though I don't particularly care for it; it relates to
    the fact that the original assembler seemed to have a bug in which
    its assembly listings printed bogus information about the <tt>BCI</tt>
    pseudo-op, though the pseudo-op was processed correctly in other
    respects.&nbsp; The modern assembler will print <tt>BCI</tt>
    correctly by default, but if you use the --past-bugs switch it will
    duplicate the original assembler's bogus printout.<br>
    <br>
    To target LVDC assembly language from the AS-512/513 flight program
    (1972) era, the <tt>--newer</tt> command-line switch is
    needed.&nbsp; I would also recommend the <tt>--fuzzy</tt> switch;
    that's because there is <i>currently</i> a discrepancy in a few
    cases between the way the original assembler and modern assembler
    rounded floating- or fixed-point decimal numbers to octals, and it
    is not yet known how to duplicate the original behavior.&nbsp; The <tt>--fuzzy</tt>
    switch merely causes the modern assembler to categorize these
    instances as "rounding errors" rather than as "errors", thus causing
    them to be less of a distraction in the printouts.&nbsp; In studying
    the code, one option that may be helpful is <tt>--no-unlist</tt>,
    which relates to the <tt>UNLIST</tt> and <tt>LIST</tt> directives
    that can appear in macros.&nbsp; Those directives were used in the
    original source code to selectively hide certain lines when macro
    expansions were printed out in assembly listings ... which usually
    made the operation of the macro easier to understand, but sometimes
    hid significant details.&nbsp; By using the <tt>--no-unlist</tt>
    switch, you can cause the <tt>UNLIST</tt> and <tt>LIST</tt>
    directives to be ignored, thus exposing macro-expansion details that
    would otherwise be hidden.<br>
    <br>
    Most command-line <tt><i>OPTIONS</i></tt> (including <tt>--no-unlist</tt>
    to some extent) relate to debugging the operation of the assembler,
    so I won't bother to cover them here.&nbsp; you can get a menu of
    all command-line options with<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaASM.py --help</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Generally speaking, LVDC source code is provided as a set of dozens
    of source-code files, in .lvdc or .lvdc8 formats, whereas you'll
    note that the usage of yaASM.py calls for a single source-code
    file.&nbsp; Thus these separate files must be concatenated into a
    single file for assembly.&nbsp; Moreover, this concatenation must be
    done in a specific order, if one expects to exactly reproduce the
    original executable word-for-word.&nbsp; So in building an actual
    LVDC program, it's best to let the build system (which is fully
    apprised of these quirks) handle the build.&nbsp; The provided
    Makefiles handle all of that.<br>
    <br>
    For example, to build an LVDC flight program (shown for AS-206RAM
    but the same steps for any AS-512 or any other LVDC/PTC program),
    you'd simply do the following:<br>
    <blockquote> <tt>cd AS-206RAM</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>make</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    or perhaps<br>
    <blockquote><tt>cd AS-206RAM</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>make clean all</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    This both performs the assembly and compares the object code
    so-produced with the octal listing transcribed from the original
    printout.&nbsp; The following files are produced:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>An assembly listing (PTC-ADAPT-Self-Test-Program.lst,
        LVDC-AS206RAM.lst, LVDC-AS512.lst, ...)<br>
      </li>
      <li>yaASM.tsv — an octal listing of the assembled code</li>
      <li>yaASM.sym&nbsp; — a symbol table</li>
      <li>yaASM.src — an address-by-address listing of source code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of the latter three files is ASCII, with tabs delimiting
      fields.&nbsp; (Or in the case of the .src file, UTF-8 rather than
      ASCII if any non-ASCII characters appear in the input LVDC/PTC
      source-code comments.)&nbsp; They are intended to be easily
      machine readable, for use as the inputs to our (eventual) LVDC/PTC
      emulator software, but are hopefully reasonably self-explanatory
      to humans as well.&nbsp; The files are produced whether or not
      there are fatal errors in the assembly process, so don't take
      their existence alone as an indication that assembly succeeded. <br>

    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; (Primarily to
        myself, I suppose.)&nbsp; Concerning the execution speed of
        yaASM.py ... it is rather slow due at least partially to certain
        features of LVDC assembly language that I was unaware of until
        LVDC programs AS-512 or even AS-513, and whose implementation
        didn't fit well into an assembler design that had worked
        perfectly well for LVDC programs AS-206RAM and PTC ADAPT
        SELF-TEST.&nbsp; In other words, the present design of the
        assembler is inefficient.&nbsp; One aspect of the assembler's
        design that is particularly problematic is the partitioning into
        several phases that are supposed to operate basically
        independently, one after the other, on the entire set of LVDC
        code.&nbsp; Perhaps one day the assembler will be rewritten
        (substantially!) to fix this poor design.<br>
        <br>
        In particular, there is a "pre-processor" phase, followed by a
        "symbol discovery" phase, followed by an "object-code creation"
        phase.&nbsp; Among other things, the pre-processor phase handles
        evaluation of assembler constants (defined by </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>EQU</tt></font><font size="-1">), conditional code
        blocks (defined by </font><font size="-1"><tt>IF</tt></font><font
        size="-1">/</font><font size="-1"><tt>ENDIF</tt></font><font
        size="-1">), and macro expansions (defined by </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>MACRO</tt></font><font size="-1">/</font><font
        size="-1"><tt>ENDMAC</tt></font><font size="-1">).&nbsp; This
        works well up to a certain point, because the pre-processor
        requires only a limited understanding of LVDC syntax, and the
        later phases of the assembler require the numerical values of
        pre-processor constants (</font><font size="-1"><tt>EQU</tt></font><font
        size="-1">) but not of their symbolic nature.<br>
        <br>
        This concept begins to break badly, however, once the </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font size="-1"> pseudo-op is
        encountered.&nbsp; </font><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font></font><font
        size="-1"><font size="-1"> is used mildly in AS-512, where it
          causes no observable problems, and intensively in AS-513,
          where it causes severe problems. </font>&nbsp; </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font size="-1"> can reassign the
        values of pre-processor constants previously assigned with </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>EQU</tt></font><font size="-1">, and the results
        of these reassignments are needed by the pre-processor.&nbsp;
        Meanwhile, the later phases of the assembler cannot use any of
        the symbolic constants affected by </font><font size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, because the later phases will receive only the <i>final</i>
        values of the constants computed by the pre-processor, rather
        than the values appropriate to their position in the source code
        stream.&nbsp; Therefore, it must be the pre-processor that
        replacesany such symbolic "constants" by their numeric
        values.&nbsp; Moreover, it should be the pre-processor that
        computes and any arithmetical expressions involving these
        "constants".&nbsp; However, the pre-processor does not fully
        possess the syntactical knowledge needed to compute such
        expressions, because (among other reasons) the later phases of
        the assembler require some of these numerical values to be
        presented as decimal numbers and others to be presented as octal
        numbers.<br>
        <br>
        The assembler works around this </font><font size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> problem by producing "mangled" versions of assembler
        constants each time it encounters an </font><font size="-1"><tt>EQU</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> or </font><font size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font
        size="-1">.&nbsp; For example, suppose we have the assembly code
        "</font><font size="-1"><tt>A EQU (1)</tt></font><font size="-1">";


































        as you might expect, the pre-processor creates a constant called
      </font><font size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font size="-1"> having
        the value 1.&nbsp; But it also creates a "mangled" constant
        named </font><font size="-1"><tt>A#0</tt></font><font size="-1">,
        also having the value of 1, and every place it encounters </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font size="-1"> subsequently, it
        replaces it by </font><font size="-1"><tt>A#0</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, so that if the value of </font><font size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> changes it still does not affect any line of code
        previously found to contain </font><font size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font
        size="-1">.&nbsp; Now suppose that at a later point in the code
        we have "</font><font size="-1"><tt>A REQ (2)</tt></font><font
        size="-1">".&nbsp; The pre-processor reacts by changing the
        value of the constant </font><font size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> to 2, but also by creating the mangled constant </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>A#1</tt></font><font size="-1"> having the value
        2, and from now on it replaces any occurrence of </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font size="-1"> by </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>A#1</tt></font><font size="-1">.&nbsp; The end
        result after the pre-processing phase is that </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font size="-1"> has whatever value
        was assigned by </font><font size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> (or </font><font size="-1"><tt>EQU</tt></font><font
        size="-1">) last.&nbsp; But that the pre-processed source code
        no longer contains any instances of </font><font size="-1"><tt>A</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> in operands.&nbsp; Rather, all of them have instead
        been replaced by </font><font size="-1"><tt>A#0</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, </font><font size="-1"><tt>A#1</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, </font><font size="-1"><tt>A#2</tt></font><font
        size="-1">, ..., etc., with each of <i>those</i> having been
        assigned a value once and never having changed thereafter.&nbsp;
        The later phases of the assembler are then free to replace these
        mangled constants by their numerical values and to format them
        in whatever base is required by the syntax.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, this description is a bit simplistic of the
        workaround is a bit simplistic, because what it fails to mention
        is that program constants (such as variable names and symbolic
        labels for program locations) form a different namespace than
        assembler constants (defined by </font><font size="-1"><tt>EQU</tt></font><font
        size="-1">/</font><font size="-1"><tt>REQ</tt></font><font
        size="-1">).&nbsp; Thus it's possible for a symbol (such as </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>S.SAT1</tt></font><font size="-1"> in AS-513) to
        exist in both namespaces.&nbsp; The pre-processor must </font><font
        size="-1"><tt>S.SAT1</tt></font><font size="-1"> by a mangled
        symbols like </font><font size="-1"><tt>S.SAT1#0</tt></font><font
        size="-1"> only if that particular usage pertains to the
        namespace of constants and not the namespace of variables and
        program labels.<br>
        <br>
        This add-on concept of mangling adds a lot of overhead and
        (perhaps) some fragility to the assembler.&nbsp; It's not the
        sole aspect of poor design, but it's certainly a prominent
        example.<br>

    <h2><a name="Flowcharts"></a>Flight Program Flowcharts</h2>
    <p>Apollo and Gemini software documentation often includes flowchart
      representations of the software, sometimes called the "math
      flow".&nbsp; In the case of Gemini, indeed, one gets the
      impression that it's the math flow that is the "software", and
      that any implementation of the math flow in some computer language
      or the other is merely an afterthought.&nbsp; Whereas today, it's
      my impression that software flowcharts have largely fallen out of
      use.&nbsp; In fact, except in the one case I was asked to create
      flowcharts (from an already-existing code base) for a patent
      application, I don't recall having encountered a flowchart in my
      entire career of about 35 years writing embedded software
      applications.&nbsp; But perhaps it was different back in the
      1960's and early 1970's.&nbsp; One thing I can say for sure is
      that a flowchart is <i>very</i> useful if you don't have access
      to actual LVDC source code, as is the case for almost anybody
      reading this page.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the specific case of the LVDC, flowcharts for the flight
      program's various "application modules" are provided by the IBM
      Federal Services Division document known as the "LVDC Equation
      Defining Document (EDD) for the Saturn Flight Program".&nbsp;
      There are two separate versions of the EDD (and various
      mission-specific revisions of each), one for the Saturn IB Flight
      Program and one for the Saturn V Flight Program.&nbsp; As of <i>this</i>
      writing, we have only EDDs for the Saturn IB — i.e., <i>not</i>
      for the Saturn V — and <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="Documents/lvdc_edd_saturn_ib_parts_iii_iv_rev_k.pdf">the
        flowcharts are found in Part III of that EDD</a>.&nbsp; The only
      revision of Part III of the Saturn IB EDD we have happens to be
      specific to the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), and thus is
      presumably directly applicable to LVDC Flight Program AS-210, with
      decreasing applicability to earlier AS-<i>xxx</i> Flight Program
      versions.&nbsp; There will be a table a bit later with links to
      the flowcharts for specific application modules, after I satisfy
      myself I've bored you sufficiently with this long-winded
      introduction.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now, at the time I wrote the paragraphs above, our acquisition of
      Part III of the Saturn IB EDD was a new thing ... indeed, I had
      first seen it earlier in the day.&nbsp; Before that, we had no
      published LVDC Flight Program flowcharts at all.&nbsp; That's is
      part of what motivates the discussion in the following paragraphs.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you are familiar with the movie <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(1997_American_film)">Contact</a>,
      based on Carl Sagan's novel, you may recall that it is the story
      of a SETI research team that begins to receive signals from
      space.&nbsp; Eventually, they discover that hidden in the signal
      are over 30K "encrypted pages" of text.&nbsp; For a while, even
      though they can view these pages individually, they're stumped
      about what to do with them more generally, because the pages don't
      mean anything by themselves in isolation, and the team can't
      figure out how to arrange the pages in any meaningful way.&nbsp;
      You see, there are mysterious markings along the edges of the
      pages that the team thinks determines the page ordering, but they
      can't understand how the markings and the ordering work in detail.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Curiously, something similar happens in the LVDC flight-software
      source code for AS-512 and AS-513.&nbsp; There are indeed
      mysterious markings along the edges of the pages, and it's very
      unclear why they're there or what they're good for.&nbsp; And make
      no mistake, the markings are part of the source code, punched on
      the original punch cards, and are not something merely generated
      by the assembly process.&nbsp; And I'm not referring to punch-card
      sequence numbers, which are indeed present, but which are
      something entirely different.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p> I actually had a conversation with one of the original LVDC
      software developers on this very topic, who told me that he (and
      presumably the remainder of his team) never knew what these
      markings were for, because they had been added before his time,
      but nobody had provided any training or instructions concerning
      them ... in spite of which, he himself had added some of those
      markings when alterations to the source code were made.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In fact, here's a sample of the source code from the AS-512
      SQUARE ROOT UTILITY module, color coded using a simple form of
      syntax highlighting; the characters in <font color="#ff0000">red</font>
      along the right-hand margin are the mystery markings:<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY.png" alt="" width="427" height="802"></div>
    <p><br>
      <i>Fortunately</i>, the markings don't have any influence on how
      the pages are ordered, or any other aspect of how the source code
      is assembled into object code, so we don't absolutely <i>need</i>
      to understand what the markings are for.&nbsp; But it would be
      nice to have some clue.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Personally, I've come up with my own theory.&nbsp; I say that
      those markings were intended to be instructions for drawing
      software flowcharts.&nbsp; It's not a perfect theory, because when
      interpreted in that light the markings work pretty well, but not
      perfectly.&nbsp; Of course, imperfection isn't too surprising in
      light of what the LVDC developer I reference above said about
      them:&nbsp; If the markings were updated by people who didn't know
      what they're for or how they worked, why would we expect them to
      be perfect?&nbsp; My guess is that the markings may have been more
      accurate at some particular earlier flight-software version, at
      which point flowcharts were drawn, but that the markings were
      allowed to rot after that because there was no need to draw more
      flowcharts.&nbsp; There wasn't any Apollo-era LVDC
      flowchart-generating software as far as I have been able to
      determine, so if the markings were indeed related to flowcharts,
      they could only have been as hints for human draftsmen, who
      wouldn't have needed absolutely perfect instructions anyway; in
      other words, perhaps the markings <i>never</i> were perfect.

        alt="" width="363" height="448" align="right">Regardless of
      whether any of that is strictly true or not, perhaps rather than
      worrying what the marks were for originally, a better question to
      ask may be whether these markings can be used <i>now</i> to help
      us generate reasonably-useful flowcharts that can help <i>us</i>?&nbsp;






























      <br>
    </p>
    <p>The answer to that question, in my estimation, is Yes, assuming
      that a little work is done to correct some of the inadequate or
      improper markings already present in the source code.&nbsp;
      Admittedly, some of the LVDC modules have more-useful flowcharts
      than do others.&nbsp; On the assumption that my suppositions about
      the markings are correct, and a suffering from a large dose of
      stubbornness, I've created <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaASM.py">LVDC






























        flowchart-generating software called yaASMflowcharts.py</a>,
      available in our software repository.&nbsp; Admittedly, it's not
      of too much use unless you're qualified to access the AS-512 and
      AS-513 source code, so I won't waste our time by telling you much
      about this software here.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now at this point, you may be rolling your eyes anyway, and
      grumbling that I've already wasted your time by telling you about
      these flowcharts you're not allowed to see.&nbsp; But where did I
      say you can't see the flowcharts?&nbsp; I've thought about this
      quite a bit, and my conclusion is that the flowcharts can in fact
      be generally distributed.&nbsp; Admittedly, my thinking is based
      on common sense rather than legalities, which is somewhat of a
      drawback.&nbsp; After all, on the basis of "common sense" there's
      not the slightest possibility of anyone using a Saturn launch
      vehicle ever again in the entire future history of <i>homo
        sapiens</i>, so restricting information about the LVDC seems
      rather pointless; but being pointless doesn't seem to be relevant
      to ITAR.&nbsp; At any rate, by my reckoning there are two pretty
      compelling reasons why the flowcharts wouldn't be restricted from
      export:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The flowcharts cannot be regarded as accurate.&nbsp; After
        all, they are based on undocumented markings, known to be
        inaccurate if interpreted as flowcharting instructions,
        "corrected" to some unknown degree by some person of unknown
        skill (me!), and then further processed by some untested
        software, developed by some unknown process to some unknown
        level of proficiency.&nbsp; It should go without saying that
        that's not how aerospace software is developed.&nbsp; Rather,
        it's how software that doesn't work is developed.&nbsp; Or
        perhaps software you get for $0.99 in an app store (before
        finding out it doesn't work).<br>
      </li>
      <li> The flowcharts do not contain an adequate level of detail to
        construct the software they supposedly describe, either
        completely or in any subset.&nbsp; <i>If</i> these flowcharts
        are useful, they're useful in understanding the control flow
        within the program, and not the calculations performed by the
        software.&nbsp; In other words, they might help you to navigate
        through the LVDC source code, but are not a replacement for that
        software.&nbsp; Consider the representative example of a
        flowchart depicted to the right:&nbsp; It tells you that to
        compute the cross product of two 3-vectors you first have to
        compute the 3 separate elements of the resulting vector.&nbsp;
        Which is fine as far as it goes.&nbsp; But it <i>doesn't</i>
        tell you how to compute those 3 separate elements in the first
        place, and without that information you're not going to get very
        far! <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Or to put it differently, in an engineering sense, it would be
      nonsensical to even attempt creating usable software from these
      flowcharts, and even if you were idiotic enough to do so you would
      quickly reach an impasse.&nbsp; Imagining that functional software
      would result from such an effort is Hollywood thinking rather than
      engineering thinking.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Which nicely brings us full circle back to <i>Contact</i>.&nbsp;
      In the movie, once the mysterious edge markings of the pages of
      "encrypted data" are finally understood, the pages are then
      understood to be instructions for building a fabulous machine of
      unknown nature and purpose, involving physical principles nobody
      understands.&nbsp; But the world's governments nevertheless build
      the machine, at enormous cost.&nbsp; And the machine works, first
      time around.&nbsp; Without significant testing, because after all,
      since the machine's function is a mystery, how could it be tested
      in advance?&nbsp; Again, Hollywood thinking!&nbsp; Not meaningful
      in the real world.<br>
    </p>
    <p>But I digress.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Without further ado, here are all of the available LVDC Flight
      Program flowcharts, both from published IBM Federal Services
      Division documentation and from my automated-generation
      effort.&nbsp; They're roughly in the order in which they appear in
      the actual source code, with some exceptions since for AS-210 I
      couldn't always determine the probable location in the source
      code.<br>

    <p>Given that the AS-210 flowcharts come directly from IBM
      documentation, whereas the AS-512 and AS-513 flowcharts were
      somewhat-speculatively semi-automatically generated by my
      software, it's worthwhile asking how closely the two agree.&nbsp;
      That's important not just for my own vanity (or embarrassment as
      the case may be), but because we'd like to know whether we can
      usefully rely on the automatically-generated ones.&nbsp; It
      doesn't take too much looking to realize that there are often
      significant disagreements.&nbsp; On the other hand, perhaps there
      <i>should</i> be significant disagreements, due to mission
      differences and due to the differences between the Saturn IB and
      the Saturn V.&nbsp; But in addition to cases where the differences
      are obvious, there are also cases where the similarities are
      eerie.&nbsp; As an example of the latter, consider the
      side-by-side complete flowcharts for the CHI COMPUTATIONS module
      seen below; AS-210 is to the left and AS-512 is to the
      right.&nbsp; Whether the automatically-generated flowcharts are
      trustworthy or not <i>in general</i>, I fear, must for now remain
      a matter of personal opinion.<br>

    <p>On a slightly-related topic, it may also be worth noting that
      I've devised color-coded, syntax-highlighted HTML LVDC program
      listings, with internal hyperlinks, just like we've had for AGC
      and AGS program listings for a long time.&nbsp; These things are
      nifty, because the flowcharts have been been somewhat-integrated
      into them for easier cross-reference.&nbsp; And while I can't show
      you the complete listings for AS-<i>xxx</i>, colorized or
      otherwise, I have prepared an <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="listings/AS-512-abridged/AS-512-abridged.html">"abridged"
        AS-512 listing, in which everything has been removed except for
        pure mathematical subroutines <span style="background-color:
          #ffff44">highlighted in yellow</span> above</a>, and in it you
      can see how the flowchart integration has been handled.<br>

    <p>Also see <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#FlowDirective">the <tt>FLOW</tt>

    <h2><a name="PreflightFlowcharts"></a>Preflight Program Flowcharts</h2>
    <p>Just as the EDD contains software flowcharts for the associated
      LVDC Flight Program, a document called the "<a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="Documents/lvdc_preflight_program_descriptions.pdf">LVDC
        Preflight Program Descriptions</a>" contains flowcharts for the
      various subroutines of the LVDC Preflight Program.&nbsp; The only
      revision of the latter document in our library claims to have an
      effectivity for the AS-512 (Apollo 17), AS-513 (Skylab 1), and
      AS-206 (Skylab 2) missions.&nbsp; And just as in the preceding
      section, we can index those flowcharts for you here.&nbsp; Unlike
      the preceding section, though, I don't currently have any idea as
      to the overall ordering of these subroutines within the Preflight
      Program's source code.<br>

    <p>Given that the LVDC was basically a pure <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black box</a> —
      in every respect other than its color, which wasn't black — it may
      be tough to come up with ways off the top of your head to
      demonstrate it actually <i>doing</i> anything ... that is, unless
      you put it in a physical Saturn IB/V rocket or a full-up emulation
      of one and blast off!&nbsp; With that said, it turns out there's a
      surprisingly large number of ways you can you can see the LVDC
      doing its thing without going to that impossible extreme.&nbsp;
      The subsections below tell you about some of them.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Don't be fooled by the way I've written these sections to suppose
      that there's no overlap between the techniques discussed
      below.&nbsp; With some limitations, any or all of the techniques
      can be used together in almost any combination.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="EmulatorDebugger"></a>Running Under the LVDC Emulator's
      Debugger</h3>
    <p>I already mentioned in <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="#yaLVDC_the_LVDC_CPU_Emulation">the section on our LVDC
        CPU emulator</a> that the emulator has a built-in debugging
      feature that you can use to get a very detailed close-up view of
      the LVDC in operation.&nbsp; It's worth reemphasizing, as well as
      reading what I said about it back then if you haven't already done
      so.&nbsp; The debugger feature is command-line only, admittedly,
      and we turn up our noses at that in these days when we've long
      been used to debuggers with graphical interfaces.&nbsp; But it's
      worth noting, I think, that a command-line debugger still far more
      convenient than any debugging capability the original LVDC
      developers had back in the day.&nbsp; More on that below.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Also as I mentioned earlier, the command set of the debugger is
      based on <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/">the widely-used GNU
        debugger (gdb)</a>, albeit providing on a small subset of the
      commands available in true gdb.&nbsp; Given that I've already
      given a brief explanation of it, I won't harp on it any further,
      except to say that you can get an idea of the capabilities by
      looking the command set as it is at the writing, courtesy of the

    <h3><a name="Running_the_PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program"></a>Running
      LVDC Code in the Programmable Test Controller (PTC)<br>
    </h3>
    <p>In the preceding section, I proffered the opinion that our LVDC
      emulator's command-line debugger is "far more convenient than any
      debugging capability the original LVDC developers had back in the
      day".&nbsp; You might be forgiven for supposing that that's pure
      unwarranted bluster on my part.&nbsp; But I think not.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The only debugging capability provided back in the day came in
      the form of the Programmable Test Controller (PTC), which I <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="#PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program">babbled



        a bit about above</a> in the section about the PTC ADAPT
      Self-Test Program.&nbsp; It's certainly true that you could do
      many of the things with the PTC that you can do with our LVDC
      emulator's debugger, such as single-step through an LVDC program,
      set breakpoints, and view memory.&nbsp; But you had to do it with
      a panel littered with dozens of push-buttons and indicator lamps,
      rather than a keyboard and an alphanumeric display, and that's not
      easy.&nbsp; Though I don't mean to suggest that the original
      developers were necessarily unhappy with it!&nbsp; Indeed, I was
      told by one of the original developers that when LVDC code written
      by prior developers was handed off to them, they often had little
      clue from the program comments or from the code itself as to what
      the code was actually doing; and thus they would put it into the
      PTC and step through it to find out!&nbsp; So even the PTC was a
      great advance over the only other alternative open to them, which
      was to glare at the code until some conception about it formed in
      their heads.<br>
    </p>
    <p>And while you probably don't have a PTC sitting around, <i>we</i>
      have a PTC emulator for you that you can use with our emulated
      LVDC, if it suits you, to produce essentially the same
      effect!&nbsp; Admittedly, even a physical PTC's CPU is not <i>exactly</i>
      identical to a physical LVDC CPU, so a little bit of code
      adaptation may be necessary.&nbsp; You couldn't, for example, run
      an entire LVDC Flight Program in the PTC.&nbsp; But you can run
      reasonable-sized chunks of code it in fairly easily, because the
      difference between PTC and LVDC code is minimal when compared (for
      example) to the differences between the Block I and Block II AGC's
      code.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Still, it's always going to be easier to run code on the PTC that
      was written specifically for it, rather than adapting code to it
      what was written for the LVDC.&nbsp; And of course, we do actually
      have such a program tailored to the PTC, namely the PTC ADAPT
      Self-Test (PAST) Program.&nbsp; So if you want to try running LVDC
      code on the PTC, the first step on the learning curve may be to
      start with the PAST program. &nbsp; Unfortunately, the process for
      doing so is a bit elaborate.&nbsp; In an attempt to maintain a <i>little</i>
      clarity without unnecessarily further cluttering this page with
      long descriptions of PTC usage, I've split discussion of the PAST
      program test procedures into a separate page:<br>
    </p>

          Mode<br>
        </h3>
        <h4><a name="BlackBoxDemos"></a>Hands-Off Demos<br>
        </h4>
        <p>Surprisingly to me, even though the LVDC has no user
          interface, you can actually make the AS-512 or AS-513 flight
          program perform significant <i>observable</i> activity, in a
          hands-off fashion, even without any simulation of any of the
          LVDC's peripheral components.&nbsp; As far as I know, this was
          first pointed out by Nik Beug, and Mike Stewart actually made
          it work.&nbsp; But you too can do it, and I'm going to tell
          you how.<br>
        </p>
        <p>This capability relies on a feature of the LVDC flight
          program that seems like an incredible oddity.&nbsp; The flight
          program has three different operating modes, one of which
          ("flight mode") corresponds to what a hypothetical Sensible
          Person™ would imagine is the <i>only</i> mode, namely the
          normal operation of launching into orbit.&nbsp; But there are
          two other modes as well, which are the "repeatable flight test
          mode" and the "non-repeatable flight test mode", sometimes
          called the "flight simulation" modes.&nbsp; In these modes,
          the LVDC neither controls the physical rocket nor reads data
          such as acceleration from the physical inertial measurement
          unit, but instead <i>simulates</i> the flight data using
          built-in equations of motion. In other words, it used physics
          to simulate the effects its commands will produce, and reads
          back this simulated data from a simulated IMU embedded in the
          flight program itself.&nbsp; The difference between the
          "repeatable" and "non-repeatable" modes is that in the
          repeatable mode, you'll consistently get the same results
          every test run because the external hardware is completely
          bypassed.&nbsp; Whereas in the non-repeatable mode, there's
          some interaction of the LVDC with external hardware, so you
          won't necessarily get precisely the same results every time,
          if only because of slight timing differences from run to run.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The upshot is that if the flight program is put into
          repeatable test mode, and if your flight program and LVDC
          function properly, then from the perspective of the LVDC it
          will <i>appear</i> as if the launch vehicle lifts off and
          goes into whatever orbit the flight program was designed
          for.&nbsp; Which is a useful test of the flight program and of
          the CPU hardware ... which in turn is pretty nifty for us,
          since we're using our own home-grown CPU emulator instead of
          an actual hardware LVDC, and we would naturally like to test
          that the CPU emulator works properly.<br>
        </p>
        <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; I said above
            that the simulation feature is an "incredible oddity".&nbsp;
            While it's clearly quite useful for <i>testing</i>
            purposes, its presence during the mission itself is very odd
            indeed in relation to "modern" thinking about
            high-reliability software.&nbsp; Modern thought is that it's
            important to not have "dead code" in your flight code.&nbsp;
            Dead code is code that won't be used during the mission, and
            the reason dead code is regarded as a poor practice is the
            question of "what if the computer starts executing that dead
            code during the actual mission due to some kind of
            glitch?"&nbsp; For example, what if there's an electrical
            discharge (such as a lighting strike) which accidentally
            puts the LVDC in a simulation mode during the ascent?&nbsp;
            Whereas instead, if your computer-memory hardware is capable
            of detecting accesses to unallocated memory, it's much safer
            to simply have nothing at all in a memory location rather
            than to have dead code in it, because an illegal memory
            access could then trigger a computer restart ... <i>much</i>
            safer than executing completely-unintended code!&nbsp; On
            the other hand, the LVDC did employ so-called Triple Modular
            Redundancy, in which three identical copies of logic modules
            were used, with majority voting among them.&nbsp; This seems
            as though it would have served to offset the danger of the
            dead code by greatly reducing the probability that a glitch
            could cause it could be executed.&nbsp; On the other hand,
            the current mode does not seem to be among the items that
            are telemetered, which is surprising since I think one would
            want to be able to detect whether the LVDC was in flight
            mode vs simulation mode.&nbsp; It would be interesting to
            know if anybody at the time considered the dead-code issue
            to be an issue at all.</font><br>

        <p>The set-up for using the repeatable flight mode to simulate
          boosting the launch vehicle into orbit is just a matter of

          mode accordingly and then jumps to the Flight Program.&nbsp;

          Preflight Program can directly access the variables <tt>D.FMDI</tt>
          and <tt>D.KB11</tt>, which reside in the Flight
          Program.&nbsp; Which it <i>could</i>, if it knew they were
          there in the first place.&nbsp; That's a bit unrealistic,
          since the Preflight Program and Flight Program would normally
          be assembled separately, as well as being loaded into the LVDC
          separately, and thus the Preflight Program wouldn't have any
          notion at all of what variables existed in the Flight Program,
          nor where they were located in memory.&nbsp; (Whereas the
          Preflight Program <i>would</i> know about entry point <tt>E.GP0</tt>,
          though perhaps not by its symbolic name, since by convention
          that entry point would always be at the fixed address
          0-10-0-000.)&nbsp; For our purposes, though, we can cheat a
          bit and optionally just add our skeleton Preflight Program
          source code to our AS-512 or AS-513 Flight Program source
          code, and assemble them both at once, thus giving the
          Preflight Program complete knowledge of the contents of the
          Flight Program.&nbsp; But we'll still be tricky about it, and
          add it to the <i>end</i> of the Flight Program source code
          instead of the beginning, even though it's at a lower address,
          to avoid changing any of the addresses of variables in data
          sector 2-17.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Actually, you don't have to do any of this yourself, since
          I've added it to the AS-512 and AS-513 source-code trees
          myself, as a source file called SKELETON_PREFLIGHT.lvdc.&nbsp;
          SKELETON_PREFLIGHT.lvdc is discarded during normal builds of
          AS-512 and AS-513, but is included if you build them like so:<br>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>make clean repeatable.tsv<br></pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>in which case the object file repeatable.tsv is created in
          place of the normal build's yaASM.tsv, and an assembly listing
          called repeatable.lst is created instead of LVDC-AS51<i>x</i>.lst.&nbsp;















          Thus if you run repeatable.tsv in the LVDC emulator, you
          should be able to get into orbit, virtually speaking.&nbsp; On
          the other hand, without some additional effort you won't <i>know</i>
          you got into orbit, since all of that takes place entirely
          within the emulated LVDC, which has no user interface.&nbsp;
          So you have to somehow capture the data from the
          simulation.&nbsp; The way I've done that myself is to use the
          emulator's <tt>--log-pio</tt> command-line switch, which
          causes a logfile (yaLVDC.pio) to be created for all of the
          Flight Program's uses of the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction, which
          in turn is used (among other things) for producing output
          telemetry:<br>

        Wait (say) 12 minutes, halt the simulation (ctrl-C), <i>et
          voilà</i>, you have a log!&nbsp; Here's a brief excerpt of the
        gibberish produced:<br>

          <li>The direction of the PIO: &gt; for "output" and &lt; for

          </li>
          <li>The value that was output or input, in octal.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are lots and lots of PIO channels used by the LVDC,
          even if we just confine ourselves to those used for telemetry,
          but let's suppose that what we're interested in are the
          altitude and velocity of the launch vehicle as a function of
          time.&nbsp; In that case, the telemetry PIO's that are
          relevant are:<br>

        <ul>
          <li><tt>D.VVS</tt> (PIO 124), total space-fixed velocity.</li>

            little Python script</a> to pull just the lines for these

            Are these results close to correct?&nbsp; According to the "<a

              V Postflight Trajectory - AS-512</a>" document, what
            happened in the actual mission on December 7, 1972, was
            this:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>1st stage separation occurred at 162.9 seconds.</li>
              <li>2nd stage separation occurred at 560.6 seconds.</li>

              </li>
            </ul>
            In comparison, our tabular simulation data would tell us
            that orbit insertion occurs at 725.5 seconds, 171.4 km, and
            7803.9.&nbsp; Pretty close!&nbsp; We'd also&nbsp; expect
            knees in the velocity curve due to the staging, at around
            160 seconds and 560 seconds, which is pretty close to what
            the velocity graph above shows.&nbsp; And in case you're
            wondering why the velocity doesn't start at 0, that's
            because the launch pad is moving at over 400 m/sec, due to
            the Earth's rotation, before the rocket even ignites.&nbsp;

                        <p>In the preceding section, use was made of the
                          ability of yaLVDC to log the execution of all
                          <tt>PIO</tt> instructions to a file.&nbsp; <tt>PIO</tt>
                          instructions are used for many type of
                          i/o.&nbsp; For example, all <i>telemetry</i>
                          output by the LVDC is in the form of <tt>PIO</tt>
                          instructions. Telemetry, of course, is the
                          data output by the LVDC (and other components
                          of the launch vehicle and space craft), for
                          transmission to the ground and indirectly to
                          mission control, so that a more-or-less
                          continuous picture of the status of the entire
                          system can be maintained in real time. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>As I mentioned earlier, yaLVDC connects to
                          peripheral devices (including recipients of
                          telemetry data) using a mechanism I refer to
                          as "virtual wiring".&nbsp; This refers to the
                          notion that the yaLVDC (the emulated LVDC CPU)
                          and its peripheral devices together form a
                          client/server system, in which yaLVDC is the
                          server and the emulated peripherals are the
                          clients.&nbsp; The data exchanged between the
                          server and client in this case consists almost
                          entirely of <tt>PIO</tt> data; in other
                          words, each message that's exchanged consists
                          basically of a <tt>PIO</tt> channel number
                          and its data.&nbsp; For example, if we had the
                          LVDC assembly-language snippet<br>
                        </p>
                        <pre>       CLA     =O27            LOAD THE ACCUMULATOR WITH OCTAL 270000000/2<br>       PIO     124             OUTPUT ACCUMULATOR ON CHANNEL OCTAL 124<br></pre>
                        <p> then in essence, the virtual-wiring message
                          output by the CPU would contain (octal) 124
                          and 134000000.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>But not all <tt>PIO</tt>'s are related to
                          telemetry, though many are; channel 124 in the
                          example above is telemetry-related, and gives
                          the total inertial velocity of the
                          vehicle.&nbsp; But often, the exact
                          interpretation of the <tt>PIO</tt>'s
                          containing data telemetered from the LVDC to
                          the ground depends on the specific LVDC Flight
                          Program version and the flight phase.&nbsp;
                          The same <tt>PIO</tt> transmitted by a
                          different flight program or in a different
                          phase of the flight may have a different
                          interpretation.&nbsp; Channel 124 is always
                          inertial velocity in any flight program I know
                          of, but other <tt>PIO</tt>'s are not always
                          the same.<br>
                        </p>
                        There are a couple of different ways to view the
                        telemetry in real time.&nbsp; One is to use the
                        same program (analyzeBoost.py) that we used in
                        the preceding section to interpret repeatable
                        flight-test mode data.&nbsp; In its simplest
                        form, the usage for viewing telemetry is this:<br>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Open up 2 separate command-line windows.</li>
                          <li>At one of the command lines, run the LVDC
                            CPU emulator, using whatever command
                            switches are appropriate:&nbsp; "<tt>yaLVDC
                              ...</tt>".</li>
                          <li>At the other command line, run "<tt>analyzeBoost.py



                              --telemetry --version=<i>N</i></tt>".&nbsp;



                            The value <i><tt>N</tt></i> is how you
                            specify the particular LVDC Flight Program,
                            which you'll recall is needed to determine
                            the specific details of interpreting <tt>PIO</tt>
                            commands as telemetry.&nbsp; The choices
                            currently are <i><tt>N</tt></i>=1 for
                            AS-206RAM, 2 for AS-512, or 3 for
                            AS-513.&nbsp; (In case you're wondering, the
                            PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program isn't one of the
                            choices for the simple reason that it does
                            not emit telemetry.)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>At this point, you should begin to see
                          telemetry data appearing, and it should be
                          relatively self-explanatory ... or at least,
                          as self-explanatory as anything related to the
                          LVDC <i>can</i> be.&nbsp; But being me, I'll
                          naturally explain it anyway, using the

                        <p>The columns are interpreted like so:<br>
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>The time, in seconds.&nbsp; This actually
                            doesn't come from yaLVDC; rather, it relates
                            to the time at which the telemetry was <i>received</i>
                            by analyzeBoost.py, measured from the time
                            analyzeBoost.py itself started up.&nbsp; So
                            if you were to pause the emulated CPU, or if
                            the emulated CPU is itself running faster or
                            slower than real time due to your selected
                            command-line switches, the timestamp might
                            not be terribly meaningful from the
                            perspective of what's going on within the
                            CPU.<br>
                          </li>
                          <li>The name of the flight-program variable
                            which is being telemetered.</li>
                          <li>The raw data value, either as an signed
                            decimal number or (if prefixed by a
                            capital-O) an unsigned octal. <br>
                          </li>
                          <li>The binary scaling applicable to the raw
                            data.&nbsp; If two different scalings are
                            listed, it's because the data is scaled
                            differently in the boost phase than it is
                            when the vehicle is in its target
                            orbit.&nbsp; If no scaling factor is listed
                            at all, that's because no scaling is
                            applicable.</li>
                          <li>If the data value is decimal, then the
                            value as scaled by the binary scaler.&nbsp;
                            If two scalers were given, the first one is
                            used.<br>
                          </li>
                          <li>The units in which the data is measured,
                            if any.</li>
                          <li>A description of what the data is supposed
                            to represent.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>As I mentioned, the timestamps provided by
                          analyzeBoost.py on each line aren't as useful
                          as they might be, because they relate to
                          elapsed time in analyzeBoost.py rather than to
                          any timing property of the emulated
                          LVDC.&nbsp; As it happens, timestamps of a
                          sort <i>are</i> among the telemetry data, but
                          are only emitted periodically rather than
                          being embedded on a <tt>PIO</tt>-by-<tt>PIO</tt>
                          basis.&nbsp; You can actually see one such
                          timestamp in the sample data above: It's <tt>D.VTAS</tt>,
                          "MISSION TIME AT ACCELEROMETER READ", and its
                          value is close to the timestamp assigned by
                          analyzeBoost.py, but not quite equal. Which
                          should not be a surprise, since given that <tt>PIO



                            000</tt> is emitted only at about 1.5 second
                          intervals, it's not very good for timestamping
                          any individual <tt>PIO</tt> records appearing
                          in the in the interim.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides the timestamps, another inconvenience
                          of analyzeBoost.py is that the telemetry
                          rushes past so fast that you can't possibly
                          see it without scrolling or without capturing
                          it by piping it into file first ... which, on
                          the other hand, is very easy to do.&nbsp;
                          However, as I said, there is an alternative
                          method of viewing the telemetry, and that's
                          via a GUI program called yaMccLvdc.py, <a
                            moz-do-not-send="true"
                            href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaLVDC">available



                            in the same place in our source-code
                            repository</a>, whose output looks something
                          like the following:<br>
                        </p>
                        <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
                            src="yaMccLvdc.png" alt="" width="1599"
                            height="757"><br>
                          <div align="left"><br>
                            Because each telemetered item stays at the
                            same position on the screen in yaMccLvdc.py,
                            rather than furiously scrolling past you,
                            it's easier to read.&nbsp; (Though you can
                            no longer capture it to a file as you could
                            have with analyzeBoost.py.)&nbsp; It's also
                            slightly more analogous to the way mission
                            controllers saw the telemetry back in the
                            day.&nbsp; On the other hand, because of
                            space limitations, you can no longer have
                            immediate on-screen access to the
                            descriptions of each item, and simply have
                            to know the names of the variables you're
                            interested in.&nbsp; But as some
                            compensation for that, if you hover the
                            mouse over a variable name, a pop-up window
                            will show its description and other
                            potentially-interesting information, as seen
                            for the variable <tt>V.CSB</tt> in the
                            screenshot.&nbsp; The telemetry is
                            alphabetized by variable name, incidentally,
                            so it is relatively easy to find any given
                            variable. Another handy feature is that if
                            you left-click one of the data readouts with
                            your mouse, you can change its color to make
                            it stand out visually and thus make it
                            easier for you to monitor on an ongoing
                            basis; the colors persist even as the
                            readings update, and they cycle through red,
                            green, blue, and black as you repeatedly
                            click.&nbsp; For example, only the
                            variables&nbsp; <tt>D.VTAS</tt> (mission
                            time elapsed), <tt>D.VVS</tt> (total
                            inertial velocity), and <tt>D.VXS</tt>/<tt>D.VYS</tt>/<tt>D.VZS</tt>
                            (fixed-space coordinates) are relevant to <a
                              moz-do-not-send="true" href="#DemoAS512">the



                              altitude and velocity graphs we made above
                              for the repeatable flight test mode</a>,
                            so before taking the screenshot you see
                            above, I had already changed their colors to
                            monitor them.&nbsp; Yet another convenience
                            feature is that if you hold down the Ctrl
                            key while left-clicking a value, then it
                            will highlight that value with a yellow
                            background for about one second every time
                            the value changes.&nbsp; An example is <tt>V.BTC</tt>.&nbsp;



                            Ctrl-clicking it again stops its the
                            highlighting.&nbsp; <br>

                            Invoking yaMccLvdc.py is much the same as

                          <div align="left">The telemetry display can be
                            quite large relative to your screen
                            real-estate if, for example, you're confined
                            to a laptop computer rather than to the kind
                            of multi-monitor desktop setup I use.&nbsp;
                            So yaMccLvdc.py has several optional
                            command-line switches you can use to make
                            telemetry display in a limited monitor setup
                            more palatable.&nbsp; One thing that may
                            happen is that your window manager may
                            decide simply to size the telemetry window
                            to fit your monitor size, rather than to
                            make it big enough to accommodate all of the
                            telemetry.&nbsp; By default, the
                            yaMccLvdc.py's telemetry window isn't
                            resizable after it has been created, in
                            which case there's no way to see all of the
                            telemetry.&nbsp; But if you add the <tt>--resize</tt>
                            command-line switch, it will let you enlarge
                            the window after it has been created.&nbsp;
                            It's true that it won't fit entirely on the
                            screen at once after it has been enlarged,
                            but at least you can slide it around to see
                            the entire contents.&nbsp; And then there's
                            the <tt>--font=<i>N</i></tt> switch, which
                            can be used to reduce the font size from the
                            default (which is 10).&nbsp; This will
                            generally make the telemetry window a lot
                            smaller.&nbsp; Another consideration is that
                            by default, I spell out all of the units
                            (like METERS/SECOND) in full, causing them
                            to occupy quite a bit of screen width.&nbsp;
                            But if you use the <tt>--abbreviate</tt>
                            switch, then some of the units can be
                            abbreviated (for example, M/S), reducing the
                            width somewhat.&nbsp; Though it's less
                            likely with every passing year, I suppose
                            it's also possible that some computer setups
                            still can't process the UTF-8 (unicode)
                            characters that I use for units such as
                            METERS<sup>-1</sup> or METERS/SECOND<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;



                            If that's your situation, you can use the <tt>--ascii</tt>
                            switch to instead display ASCII-only
                            representations like METERS**-1 and
                            METERS/SECOND**2.&nbsp; It won't reduce the
                            window size, obviously.<br>

                        <p>Data isn't merely sent from the LVDC to
                          mission control via telemetry, but can be sent
                          from mission control to the LVDC as well ...
                          though in the latter case the data is normally
                          called a "command", and it's delivered by
                          what's known as the Digital Command System
                          (DCS).&nbsp; I suppose I should give a
                          disclaimer right up front that when considered
                          as a kind of interface for user input into the
                          LVDC, DCS leaves a lot to be desired.&nbsp;
                          For one thing, it is capable of doing quite a
                          lot less then you might imagine ... while at
                          the same time, most of what you <i>can</i> do
                          with it is limited to very specific phases of
                          the mission.&nbsp; Well, it is what it is, and
                          like Popeye the Sailor, that's all that it
                          is.&nbsp; A corollary of that is that there's
                          a bit of a steep learning curve as well.&nbsp;
                          Adjust your expectations accordingly.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Regarding the AS-206RAM mission, I know that
                          it had DCS capability because the comments in
                          the Flight Program's source code do refer to
                          it.&nbsp; But there's no documentation about
                          it, and nothing in the AS-206RAM Flight
                          Program seems to process it directly.&nbsp; I
                          suspect that this is due to DCS having been
                          processed back in those early days by the
                          Preflight Program (which we don't have) rather
                          than by the Flight Program (which we
                          do).&nbsp; In other words, the Preflight
                          Program would have received and processed all
                          of the incoming DCS commands, and just passed
                          along to the Flight Program whatever dribble
                          of information it thought was needed.&nbsp; I
                          suppose.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereas, in later missions the DCS was
                          processed by the Flight Program.&nbsp; So the
                          amount of information about DCS in the AS-512
                          and AS-513 missions is a bit more substantial
                          if not 100% complete.&nbsp; Besides the
                          flight-program source code itself, section 10

                        <p>As far as what I said above that DCS being
                          more limited than you might expect is
                          concerned, you can see that in the table
                          above.&nbsp; For example, noticing that there
                          are DCS commands to download chunks of LVDC
                          memory, you might suppose that there would
                          also be DCS commands to upload chunks of
                          memory ... but there aren't.&nbsp; So DCS <i>cannot</i>
                          be used for purposes such as patching the
                          software — what for the AGC was known as
                          Erasable Memory Programs (EMPs) — nor even for
                          changing the value of a single variable.&nbsp;
                          Not unless it had been decided in advance to
                          allow certain limited changes to a particular
                          variable and provide a DCS command dedicated
                          to that specific variable.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>How does one send a DCS command to the
                          LVDC?&nbsp; Well, in the case of the "modern"
                          LVDC emulator, you can use the very same
                          yaMccLvdc.py program we used in the preceding
                          section for viewing telemetry.&nbsp; The
                          program has an extra DCS window that I didn't
                          show you before, enabled by a command-line
                          switch (<tt>--dcs</tt>).&nbsp; The DCS window
                          when emulating AS-513 looks something like the
                          following:<br>
                        </p>

                            You'll notice in the screenshot that just as
                            with the telemetry window, hovering the
                            mouse over many of the items in the window
                            will give you more information about what
                            those items are.<br>
                            <br>
                            Along the left side is a series of buttons,
                            one for each of the different DCS mode
                            commands defined for the mission.&nbsp; Some
                            of these commands require you enter some
                            numerical information to be transmitted to
                            the LVDC along with the command.&nbsp; <tt>NAVIGATION



                              UPDATE</tt> is an example of that, as it
                            requires you to enter three components of a
                            velocity vector, three components of a
                            position vector, and a time.&nbsp; Other
                            commands, such as <tt>TERMINATE</tt> or <tt>INHIBIT



                              WATER VALVE LOGIC</tt> don't require you
                            to enter any numerical data at all.&nbsp; At
                            any rate, once you've entered whatever data
                            is required, you simply click the button,
                            and the command+data is sent to the LVDC,
                            where it reacts to it in whatever way the
                            LVDC software dictates.<br>
                            <br>
                            But there are several annoyances in terms of
                            trying to use DCS to actually see an
                            emulated LVDC actually <i>do</i> anything,
                            and so it's necessary to engage in various
                            forms of trickery to actually exercise any
                            DCS commands.&nbsp; All of these annoyances,
                            though, as far as I'm aware, stem from the
                            simple fact that you can't just use any
                            arbitrarily-selected DCS command at any time
                            of your choosing, but rather can only do so
                            during pre-selected phases of the
                            mission.&nbsp; And the acceptable time
                            intervals are pretty restrictive!&nbsp; Not
                            only that, but the entirety of repeatable
                            flight-test mode — our favorite way of
                            running the LVDC Flight Program in emulation
                            so far — is disallowed.<br>
                            <br>
                            As it happens, I don't have enough
                            documentation for AS-512 or AS-513 to give
                            you an authoritative list of when their DCS
                            commands are accepted and when they are not,
                            but I can illustrate my point with a table
                            from <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                              href="Documents/19700015780_1970015780.pdf#page=27">the

                            Indeed, as you may imagine from the table
                            above, it's actually tough to find any time
                            when we <i>can</i> sent a DCS command to
                            the LVDC and expect it to be accepted.<br>
                            <br>
                            So if we want to play with DCS commands in
                            the emulator, we have to resort to a bit of
                            trickery.&nbsp; There are several ways the
                            Flight Program can block our access to DCS
                            commands, and we have to defeat all of
                            them.&nbsp; Our method is to exploit <a

                            To do so, it's helpful to have a <i>little</i>
                            information about how the DCS system
                            actually functions in LVDC hardware and in
                            the Flight Program.&nbsp; Very briefly, a
                            DCS command is transmitted to the LVDC as a
                            sequence of one or more 35-bit "words", that
                            (after massaging by the IU hardware) are
                            presented to the flight software as the same
                            number for 26-bit words accessed via the
                            CPU's <tt>PIO 043</tt> instruction.&nbsp;
                            Every time such a word appears, a specific
                            type of interrupt used only for DCS triggers
                            an interrupt service routine in the Flight
                            Program (or Preflight Program, for early
                            versions).<br>
                            <br>
                            So the <i>first</i> thing that can go wrong
                            is that the Flight Program may have
                            instructed the LVDC hardware to completely
                            mask out DCS interrupts, so that the Flight
                            Program has no knowledge of them at
                            all.&nbsp; The CPU instruction <tt>PIO 032</tt>
                            is what controls this interrupt-mask
                            register.&nbsp; We designate the bits in <tt>PIO</tt>
                            registers as S (most-significant), 1, 2,
                            ..., 25, and using this naming convention,
                            the DCS interrupt is masked out if bit 5 of
                            <tt>PIO 032</tt> is 1.&nbsp; Fortunately,
                            you don't see this happen too often, so it's
                            not normally what you have to worry about
                            ... but it <i>can</i> happen.&nbsp; In the
                            emulator's debugger, you can examine the
                            interrupt mask with the <tt>X</tt> command,
                            like so:<br>
                            <blockquote>
                              <pre>&gt; X PIO-032<br><br>PIO-032: 000000000 (000000000)<br></pre>
                            </blockquote>
                          </div>
                          <div align="left">Of the two numbers shown,
                            both of which are 27 bits vs the 26 bits of
                            the actual <tt>PIO</tt> registers, the
                            first number is right-aligned (i.e., with
                            the leftmost bit being literally 0, and the
                            others being the PIO bits S, 1, ..., 25) and
                            the second is left-aligned (with the
                            leftmost bits being the PIO bits S, 1, ...,
                            25, and the rightmost being a placeholder
                            for a parity bit).&nbsp; It's important to
                            keep this distinction in mind, because both
                            conventions are used in the software,
                            annoyingly, and you simply have to know
                            which is which.&nbsp; But regardless, you
                            see all zeroes like this, then obviously no
                            interrupts are masked.&nbsp; On the other
                            hand, if <i>only</i> the DCS interrupt were
                            masked, you would have seen <tt>PIO-032:
                              004000000 (010000000)</tt>.<br>
                            <br>
                            The next thing that can go wrong — and
                            certainly <i>will</i> go wrong in
                            repeatable flight-test mode — is that the
                            Flight Program maintains a variable called <tt>D.VIHC</tt>
                            that it also uses to mask interrupts ...
                            although in this case, the bits are 1 if the
                            interrupt is enabled and 0 if the interrupt
                            is masked.&nbsp; In repeatable flight-test
                            mode, here's what you will see if you
                            examine its value in the debugger:<br>
                            <blockquote>
                              <pre>&gt; X &amp;D.VIHC<br><br>2-17-206: 320000000 (640000000)<br></pre>
                            </blockquote>
                            (The notation 2-17-206 is the address of the
                            variable, and will differ between different
                            versions of the Flight Program.)&nbsp; In
                            the case of <tt>D.VIHC</tt>, it's bit 4
                            (rather than bit 5 as above) that
                            corresponds to the DCS interrupt, so with a
                            mask like the one shown above, that bit is
                            0, and the DCS interrupt is still
                            masked.&nbsp; You can enable it using the
                            debugger:<br>
                            <blockquote>
                              <pre>&gt; SET D.VIHC=0330000000<br><br>Overwriting value 320000000 with 330000000.<br></pre>
                            </blockquote>
                            How effective this is in allowing the Flight
                            Program to receive DCS commands
                            varies.&nbsp; In some of the Flight
                            Program's time bases, this setting persists
                            until the end of the time base; in others,
                            it's essentially undone immediately.&nbsp;
                            If you happen to be in one of the time bases
                            where it persists, though, once you allow
                            the Flight Program to continue its free run
                            (with the debugger's <tt>CONTINUE</tt>
                            command), you'll now be able to send the
                            Flight Program DCS commands, and have them
                            acknowledged!<br>
                            <br>
                            Which is great, but those DCS commands
                            usually won't do anything in most time
                            bases.&nbsp; Instead, you get back an error
                            response from the Flight Program that
                            translates as "The mode command received is
                            defined for this mission but is not
                            acceptable in the present time frame".<br>
                            <br>
                            That's because the Flight Program has yet
                            another variable you need to
                            manipulate.&nbsp; In AS-512 and AS-513, it's
                            called <tt>D.VLNK</tt>, and it determines
                            which <i>particular</i> DCS commands are
                            currently allowed.<br>
                            <blockquote>
                              <pre>&gt; X &amp;D.VLNK<br><br>2-17-073: 000000000 (000000000)<br></pre>
                            </blockquote>
                            This, of course, means "none of them are
                            allowed".&nbsp; I won't bore you by giving
                            you lists (separate for AS-512 vs AS-513) of
                            which bits in <tt>D.VLNK</tt> correspond to
                            which DCS commands, since it's easier to
                            simply enable everything:<br>
                            <blockquote>

        </h2>
        <i> </i><i>(This section is under development.)</i><br>
        <br>
        Let me pause for a moment to summarize, reiterate, and enlarge
        upon some of the points I've already covered above:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>The LVDC was a product of IBM Federal Systems Division in
            Owego, New York.&nbsp; It nevertheless appears as though
            many (or perhaps all) of the LVDC software developers
            resided in Huntsville, Alabama.</li>
          <li>The software they developed comprised several
            semi-independent programs, including the LVDC's "Flight
            Program" (FP), "Pre-Flight Program" (PF), and possibly an
            "Executive Control Program" (ECP).&nbsp; By
            "semi-independent", I mean that while these programs were
            co-resident in the LVDC memory, they had only limited
            interactions with each other during usage.&nbsp; Moreover,
            they were developed by separate groups, and those
            development groups had no need to interact with each other
            as long as the rules for interfacing between the different
            software programs were rigidly obeyed.</li>
          <li>At the beginning, the LVDC software for each mission was <i>ad
























































              hoc</i>, though adapted from the software for a preceding
            mission.&nbsp; Later, however, a "Generalized Flight
            Program" (GFP) was created, which incorporated the features
            from preceding missions in a more consistent, configurable
            way.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        As far as the FP is concerned, it seems that development was
        carried out by two separate teams.&nbsp; These teams leapfrogged
        through the missions; i.e., perhaps oversimplifying, one team
        worked on the odd-numbered missions, while the other teams
        worked on the even-numbered missions.&nbsp; At least for the
        early Apollo missions, these teams generally consisted of two
        developers, sometimes with a third "newbie" added if the lead
        developer was preparing to leave the team.&nbsp; By the time of
        the Skylab missions, teams usually had four software developers.<br>

                  Apollo 1 fire, and that the rocket was eventually
                  repurposed for the Skylab 2 mission (see below).&nbsp;
                  However, flight program AS-206RAM was developed for
                  this (unflown) alternative mission profile in the

                  also implies that the GFP was used in some form for
                  SA-505 (Apollo 10).&nbsp; But since Jim was involved
                  neither with SA-504 (Apollo 9) or SA-506 (Apollo 10)
                  teams, his comments do <i>not</i> imply that the GFP

        A lot of the information on this page that doesn't come directly
        from the surviving documentation is largely due to conversations
        with Barry Silverman, who has made a significant effort to find
        and talk to original LVDC developers.&nbsp; Jim Howell has also
        provided almost all of the perspective on how the development
        effort was organized.<br>
