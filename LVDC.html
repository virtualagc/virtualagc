    Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) was a computer that resided in the
    Instrument Unit (IU) that perched above the Saturn IVB that was the
    second stage in a Saturn IB rocket and the third stage in a Saturn V
    rocket.&nbsp; The LVDC was a completely separate computer system
    from the AGC, with a different architecture, different
    instruction-set, and different runtime software.&nbsp; The purpose
    of the LVDC was to precisely control the Saturn from shortly before
    liftoff until the point at which the Saturn was discarded by the
    CSM.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <table summary="" style="text-align: left; width: 60%; margin-left:

            </div>
            People generally think that the guidance computer (AGC) of
            the command module controlled the Saturn rocket, but it
            isn't true.&nbsp; During burns of the S-II and S-IVB rocket
            stages, it <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span>
            possible for the CSM's AGC to control the steering, as a
            backup to the LVDC.&nbsp; That backup capability was never
            used in a mission.&nbsp; This was not possible during burns
            of the first stage (S-IB or&nbsp; S-IC).&nbsp; However, the
            AGC's ability to directly control the Saturn IVB was used
            for other purposes during the mission.&nbsp; <a

      <br>
    </div>
    The LVDC has a less-visible role in people's eyes than the AGC, not
    only because it was used for only a very small portion of the
    individual missions, but also because it had no user interface as
    such.&nbsp; In other words, it was a black box that responded to
    inputs from sensors in the Saturn and to ground telemetry, but there
    was no panel into which astronauts could enter commands or get
    feedback from it.&nbsp; One might well call the LVDC "The Forgotten
    Computer", even more so that the computer of the <a
      href="yaAGS.html">LM's Abort Guidance System</a>.&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, the LVDC's importance is great, because you need to
    actually get the Command Module and Lunar Module into space and
    headed toward the moon if you expect any landings to occur!&nbsp; As
    I understand it, the folks that actually worked on the Saturn
    referred to the Instrument Unit as "The Brain", and that term might
    as well be applied to the LVDC, since it was the brain of The Brain.<br>

    The LVDC was developed by IBM Federal Systems Division, rather than
    by the MIT Instrumentation Lab that developed the AGC, so there was
    no overlap in development personnel between the LVDC and AGC
    systems.&nbsp; Furthermore, there was almost no overlap in
    engineering technique, other than that both groups of necessity were
    generally constrained by the technology available at the time.&nbsp;
    For example, both needed to use memory based on ferrite-core
    technology.&nbsp; Moreover, there was no interaction between the
    LVDC and AGC systems.<br>
    <br>
    Actually, there was <i>some</i> interaction between the development
    groups, in the sense that at some point in 1963 or before the idea
    arose that the LVDC might be used in place of the AGC in the CM and
    LM, and that this move might save some time and money.&nbsp; In
    fact, IBM produced a 300+ page report detailing the differences
    between the two systems with the apparent object of arguing this
    point, and the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory's antibodies flooded
    in to destroy the invader with critiques and reports negative of the
    IBM report.&nbsp; In the end, the Instrumentation Lab won this
    particular battle, relegating the LVDC to the relatively small share
    of public attention that it presently enjoys.<br>

      Devices</h2>
    As with any of the other computer systems we cover here at Virtual
    AGC, the LVDC does not stand alone and do its computing in a
    computing vacuum (so to speak).&nbsp; The subsystems involved are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA) interfaced the LVDC's
        digital signals to the analog world of the Instrument Unit's
        sensors.&nbsp; Actually, the LVDA is so closely coupled to the
        LVDC that it may make more sense to consider them as forming a
        single unit, though packaged separately.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The ST-124-M Inertial Platform Assembly—catchy name!—was an
        inertial measuring unit that supplied the LVDC with information
        about the rocket's orientation and acceleration.&nbsp; It had 3
        integrating accelerometers that measured acceleration with
        respect to the stable (space-fixed as opposed to rocket-fixed)
        platform, as well as angular sensors to measure the orientation
        of the stable platform with respect to the rocket.&nbsp; Like
        the AGC IMU, it was a 3-gimbal system and therefore
        theoretically subject to "gimbal lock", but because the range of
        motion of the rocket during the burn phase, I suppose that
        avoidance of gimbal lock must have been somewhat easier than in
        the CM or LM.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The "Control Computer" or "Flight Control Computer" was an
        analog computer that translated attitude-correction commands,
        angular change, and vehicle lateral acceleration information
        into propulsion-system thruster nozzle and/or engine actuator
        positioning commands.&nbsp; As such, it is of little interest in
        simulation of the LVDC (which is our primary concern at Virtual
        AGC).&nbsp;&nbsp; If the naming of this device seems odd, note
        that it follows the general convention of the word "control"
        being defined to mean the execution of an action that has been
        decided upon elsewhere, and not the act of decision-making.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The Control-EDS Rate Gyros.</li>
      <li>The Control Accelerometers (Saturn IB only).</li>
      <li>The propulsion engine actuators.</li>
      <li>The auxiliary propulsion system.&nbsp; This was a set of 6
        nozzles mounted on the aft end of the S-IVB stage which were
        used to provide attitude control in coasting (non-burn)
        periods.&nbsp; I believe that it may also have provided roll
        control during the S-IVB turn during boost.&nbsp; (The engines
        of the S-IC and S-II stages could provide complete
        pitch/yaw/roll control, but the engine of the S-IVB state could
        only control pitch and yaw, and therefore needed to be
        supplemented to provide control of roll.)&nbsp; The auxiliary
        propulsion system was directly controlled by the Flight Control
        Computer, but the Flight Control Computer was commanded by the
        LVDC.</li>
      <li>Telemetry downlink.</li>
      <li>Command uplink.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    At the end of the preceding section was an illustration of a very
    simplified logical view of the interconnection of the LVDC to
    various peripherals.&nbsp; Here is a somewhat more complete
    illustration for the Saturn IB:<br>

            <p>The LVDC and the AGC did not actually have any direct
              interaction, so we may as well talk about how the AGC
              interacted with the Saturn before immersing ourselves in

              either of the graphics at the end of the preceding
              section, you'll see the four ways that the Instrumentation
              Unit (IU) in the Saturn IVB and the Spacecraft (i.e, the
              Command Module) — which are separated by a horizontal
              dotted line near the tops of the two graphics —
              interacted:<br>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The Abort Decision signal.</li>
              <li>The Status signal.</li>
              <li>The Mode Command signal.</li>
              <li>The Alternate Steering Commands signals.</li>
            </ol>
            The Saturn was always steered by the so-called Flight
            Control Computer (depicted in the picture at the right), an
            analog computer whose salient characteristic for our
            purposes is that it was <i>not</i> the LVDC.&nbsp; However,
            the flight-control computer did not operate on its own, and
            thus itself needed to be supervised.&nbsp; Normally, that
            supervision was performed, by default, by the LVDC,
            indirectly through the LVDA, the Launch Vehicle Data
            Adapter. <br>
            <p>However, it was also possible for the spacecraft to send
              the flight control computer a signal, the Mode Command,
              which instructed it to accept Alternate Steering Commands
              from the AGC rather than the default steering commands
              from the LVDC/LVDA.&nbsp; Thus, the AGC could steer the
              Saturn IVB (but not some of the other Saturn stages) by
              this mechanism.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, it was also desirable for the spacecraft to be
              able to monitor the activity of the Saturn, even under
              normal conditions when the LVDC was controlling the
              rocket.&nbsp; Since the spacecraft had its own Inertial
              Measurement Unit (IMU), it knew its own orientation and
              acceleration — and hence the Saturn's — at all times, and
              the AGC could integrate these quantities to know the
              velocity and position at all times.&nbsp; Thus it was not
              necessary for the IU to communicate that information to
              the spacecraft in order for the AGC to monitor the
              physical motion of the rocket and to display it for the
              astronauts on the DSKY.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I actually have an interesting graphic of the monitoring
              process to show you.&nbsp; This graphic is not from
              physical system.&nbsp; Rather, Riley Rainey has used the
              "equation defining document" which specified how the
              Instrumentation Unit (IU) was <i>supposed</i> to behave,
              to model the physical behavior of the rocket and the
              spacecraft's IMU, allowing Virtual AGC to monitor the
              launch behavior on a simulated DSKY.&nbsp; Here's a short
              movie he has created of that simulation.&nbsp; It's
              admittedly a little fuzzy, since I blew it up by about 2×,
              but perhaps we'll be able to get a better one sometime in
              the future:</p>
            <div align="center"> <a

            <br>
            Of course, at the left in the video, you can see the
            simulated FDAI and DSKY.&nbsp; At the right, you can see
            telemetry from the AGC.&nbsp; You'll notice that at the
            beginning of the movie, the DSKY's UPLINK indicator is
            on.&nbsp; That's apparently because Riley's simulated DSKY
            (which is his own, and not the simulated DSKY we provide)
            isn't fully functional in the sense of accepting keypad
            input, so Riley is instead feeding the AGC commands via the
            digital uplink.<br>

    System, though it's getting better over time.&nbsp; What little
    survives that we have been able to access can be found in our <a
      href="links.html#LVDC">Document Library</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I'm also told that there are a number of published (but not
    necessarily free-of-charge) research papers about the LVDC.&nbsp;
    These may be of assistance if you're an enthusiast, but I cannot
    provide any of them for you, for legal reasons.&nbsp; Specifically,
    you can go to <a href="http://arc.aiaa.org/">the AIAA's website</a>,
    and search for "LVDC".&nbsp; Or as another example, via the IEEE's
    website, you can get an article about the "<a

      Saturn Flight Program Simulator</a>", as pointed out to me by one
    of the article's authors.&nbsp; (Thanks, Tom Dillon!)<br>
    <h2><a name="LVDC_Software"></a>LVDC Software</h2>
    <h3><a name="Overall_Structure"></a>Overall Structure</h3>
    <p>Describing the overall structure of the software loaded into the
      LVDC is a bit tricky at the present time.&nbsp; That's because
      documentation is scarce, our cache of original LVDC software is
      sparse, and the original development process seemed quite
      compartmentalized.&nbsp; By the latter, I mean that programmers
      concentrated on the specific areas to which they were assigned,
      and often seem to have had little cognizance of even the most
      basic features of the software when those features happened to be
      outside their narrow specialization.&nbsp; Plus the set of LVDC
      programmers available to me is limited, so I don't have
      representatives of all of those specializations to consult
      with.&nbsp; Of course, it's also possible that the many decades
      between the time they spent working on the project and the time I
      was able to quiz them about it may also have acted to erase some
      of the information.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In short, important aspects of my descriptions in these sections
      concerning the gross structure of&nbsp; the software are based on
      my own inferences and on the recollections of developers not
      entirely familiar with the details.&nbsp; So my comments about the
      program structure with a large grain of salt.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With that said, let's contrast the overall structure of the LVDC
      code vs the software source code for the Apollo Guidance Computer
      (the programs <a href="Colossus.html">COLOSSUS</a>, <a
        href="Luminary.html">LUMINARY</a>, and so on) and for the <a
        href="yaAGS.html">Abort Guidance System</a>.&nbsp; All of these
      non-LVDC programs were <i>monolithic</i> in nature.&nbsp; What I
      mean by that is that although the AGC and AGS software was
      structured into various semi-independent sections, for which the
      development of each was presided over by specialists in those
      specific areas, the source code for them was nevertheless
      presented to the programmers in a single large chunk — i.e., a
      single, unified program listing.&nbsp; Every AGC or AGS developer
      saw the entire source code, regardless of whether it pertained to
      them or not.&nbsp; The natural result was that it was possible
      (and even likely) for an AGC or AGS developer to have some grasp
      of the large-scale structure of the software, beyond his or her
      own narrow area of specialization.&nbsp; Similarly, every word
      stored in the AGC or AGS core memory came from that source
      code.&nbsp; In that sense, each AGC or AGS program listing was
      entirely self-contained.&nbsp; If you were able to assemble those
      program listings, then you obtained a rope image that could be
      loaded into the computer and run.&nbsp; Conversely, every word in
      core-memory either came directly from the associate program
      listing or from some action taken by the code in that program
      listing.&nbsp; When you look at a program listing for (say)
      LUMINARY, you see the <i>entire</i> contents of the Lunar
      Module's AGC's core memory.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The overall structure of the LVDC software, however, is
      fundamentally different.&nbsp; Simultaneously loaded into the LVDC
      core memory were <i>several</i> different logically-distinct
      "programs", each with <i>different</i> sets of source code,
      assembled <i>separately</i> from each other, and having different
      areas of specialization.&nbsp; Thus assembly of any given one of
      these programs did not produce a full core-rope image: merely a
      partial rope image.&nbsp; A full rope image could be obtained only
      by merging all of the partial core-rope images from the different
      assemblies of the several sets of source code.&nbsp; The separate
      programs I'm aware of are discussed individually in the sections
      that follow, but in brief, they were:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Preflight Program</li>
      <li>The Executive Control Program</li>
      <li>The Flight Program<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A similar situation arises in modern computer systems, where you
      typically have an "operating system" program and "application
      programs" running in the computer at the same time.&nbsp; The
      application programs rely on the operating system for certain
      functionality, but have no understanding of how the operating
      system provides that functionality.&nbsp; All the application
      program needs to know is the exact method for requesting the
      desired function from the operating system.&nbsp; Similarly, the
      operation system stands ready to provide the desired
      functionality, but has no knowledge of the internal workings of
      the application program requesting service.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the LVDC, the method by which interaction between independent
      but simultaneously-loaded programs worked was for there to be an
      agreed-upon set of specific memory addresses hard coded into the
      programs.&nbsp; For example, one program would know that to obtain
      a certain type of service, it had to call a routine at a certain
      fixed address in memory.&nbsp; Another program would know that it
      had to put code providing certain types of services at certain
      fixed addresses, but have no other knowledge of the program(s)
      utilizing that functionality.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Because of this much higher degree of compartmentalization,
      programmers working on (say) the Flight Program might have no
      cognizance at all of the Preflight Program, the developers of
      which might have no cognizance of the Executive Control Program,
      and so on.&nbsp; And unfortunately, that means that <i>we</i>
      don't, either.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Preflight_Program"></a>Preflight Program</h3>
    <p>I don't know anything at all about the Preflight Program at
      present.&nbsp; I.e., there is no surviving documentation or source
      code for it as far as I know.&nbsp; I will provide information
      about it if/when it becomes available.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As it relates to the <a href="#Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software">AS-206RAM




































        Flight Program</a>, however, I do have a couple of reasons to
      believe that the AS-206RAM Flight Program would have been used in
      conjunction with a Preflight Program:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the AS-206RAM Flight Program (1967), there are jumps to
        various memory locations in regions of core memory at which
        AS-206RAM itself does not define any code or variables.&nbsp; It
        stands to reason that <i>something</i> is stored there.&nbsp; <a
          href="#Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software">This is discussed in
          more detail below</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>One of the original LVDC software developers (thanks, Pat
        Woods!) tells me that he believes that the Flight Program shared
        memory with a Preflight Program that ran before liftoff.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><a name="Executive_Control_Program"></a>Executive Control
      Program</h3>
    <p>Original LVDC software developer Pat Woods tells me that there
      was no Executive Control Program (ECP) in use until the Apollo 12
      mission.&nbsp; This anecdotal information is backed up by the fact
      that the Saturn Launch Vehicle Astrionics Systems Handbook has 14
      pages of descriptive material about the ECP in its <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/AstrionicsSystemsHandbook_Nov69.pdf">November



































        15 1969 release</a> (see section 11.2.1 in particular), but does
      not even mention the ECP at all in its <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/MSFC-IV-4-401-1-AstrionicsSystemHandbookSaturnLaunchVehicles.pdf">November



































        1 1968 release</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I won't describe the ECP further here, since we have no source
      code for it, but if you are interested you should consult the
      later release of the Astrionics Systems Handbook mentioned above.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is unfortunately not clear from the description whether the
      ECP constituted a program <i>separate</i> from the Flight Program
      with which it was used — i.e., whether it had a separate set of
      source code that was assembled separately from the Flight Program
      — or whether the two had an integrated code base that was
      assembled as a single operation.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Flight_Program_in_General"></a>Flight Program in
      General</h3>
    <p>The software was apparently known simply as the Flight Program,
      and didn't have a catchy name such as "Luminary".<br>
    </p>
    <p>You may also see references to the Generalized Flight Program
      (GFP) or generalized Flight Program System, in use from Apollo 12
      onward.&nbsp; You may recall from <a
        href="#Executive_Control_Program">the preceding section</a> that
      the Executive Control Program also came into use from Apollo 12
      onward.&nbsp; My supposition would be that this simply means that<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>GFP = ECP + FP<br>
    </blockquote>
    Was the software classified?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Or at least it was not
    classified at the time period from which we begin to have any
    information.&nbsp; Several people associated with the development
    have stated to me that it was classified.&nbsp; But classified
    material must be stamped with one of the designations <tt>CONFIDENTIAL</tt>,
    <tt>SECRET</tt>, or <tt>TOP SECRET</tt>.&nbsp; The available
    software listing is not so stamped, and therefore should not be
    considered classified.&nbsp; Undoubtedly IBM Federal Systems
    Division considered it confidential at the time, under the common
    usage of the word, but that doesn't make it classified.

    <h3><a name="Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software"
        id="Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software"></a>AS-206RAM Flight
      Program<br>
    </h3>
    To a computer programmer, the most important thing about any
    computer program is its source code, and at present a single
    revision of the flight program is available to us.&nbsp; (For
    non-flight software, though, see the PAST program described in <a
      href="#PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program">the next section</a>.)&nbsp;
    The flight program at issue is an engineering revision of the
    software, from September 1967, designated "AS-206RAM LVDC FLIGHT
    PROGRAM".&nbsp; If you were to Google this (<b>don't do it!</b>),
    you may unnecessarily excite yourself by noting that Saturn IB
    launch vehicle AS-206 was used for the Skylab 2 mission
    (Conrad/Weitz/Kerwin).&nbsp; You may then be chagrined to realize
    that the Skylab 2 mission was in 1973, far past the 1967 time frame
    in which this revision of the program is developed.&nbsp; What
    gives?&nbsp; The answer, is that AS-206 was <i>originally</i>
    intended for an unmanned mission that was canceled after the Apollo
    1 fire.&nbsp; The software we have is not even for that canceled
    early AS-206 mission, but rather for a proposed backup to the
    canceled mission.&nbsp; So whatever software the LVDC had when
    AS-206 eventually launched as Skylab 2, is not <i>this</i>
    software.&nbsp; That doesn't alter the fact that this software is
    ancestral to the versions that followed it ... or at least a very
    close cousin to the ancestor of the versions following it.&nbsp;
    There are some references in the software to AS-205, which is what
    would have been Apollo 2 (the 2nd manned Apollo mission) had the
    tragic Apollo 1 fire not occurred; naturally, Apollo 2 was canceled
    thereafter.&nbsp; The designation AS-205 was <i>later</i> used
    instead for Apollo 7, though considering the time-frames involved,
    it's likely that the reference in the source code is to Apollo 2
    rather than Apollo 7.&nbsp; In other words, the AS-206RAM flight
    program we have had likely been branched off from the LVDC software
    being developed for the never-flown Apollo 2 mission.<br>
    <br>
    From the preceding sections and from the date of the software,
    you'll note that there is likely no Executive Control Program (ECP)
    associated with this software, but that there should be a separate
    Preflight Program (which we know essentially nothing about)
    interacting with it through shared memory.&nbsp; Thus the AS-206RAM
    Flight Program we have does <i>not</i> completely describe the
    contents of LVDC core memory, and thus is not a complete LVDC
    program as it stands.&nbsp; More on this below.<br>
    <br>
    As far as an AS-206RAM mission specifically is concerned, "RAM"
    stands for Restart Alternate Mission.&nbsp; We have the document "<a
      href="Documents/19680007324.pdf">AS-206 S-IVB RESTART ALTERNATE
      MISSION LAUNCH VEHICLE OPERATIONAL FLIGHT TRAJECTORY</a>", which I
    expect would be pretty invaluable in understanding the expected
    operation of the flight program.&nbsp; To quote the document itself,<br>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <blockquote><small>The basic purpose of the Apollo Saturn 206 S-IVB
        Restart Alternate Mission is to place the S-IVB stage into orbit
        and test its restart capability, simulating the AS-501 mission
        profile. In the event S-IVB restart problems occur in the early
        Saturn V flights, this mission will be flown to help correct or
        solve the problems. The primary objective of the SA-206 Launch
        Vehicle is to insert the S-IVB/IU/Payload configuration into a
        near earth 100 nautical mile circular orbit. The payload
        consists of a Spacecraft LM Adapter (SLA) and a 25° Nose Cone
        (NC #2).</small><br>
    </blockquote>
    As usual in these matters, what <i>we</i> have is not the punch
    cards on which the assembly-language source code was originally
    provided to the assembler program, but the "assembly listing" output
    by the assembler.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the status of the assembly
    process for it found 41 warnings and 7 errors — meaning that there
    were problems in the source code and that the assembly process <i>failed</i>.&nbsp;











































































    Thus the program wouldn't actually work as-is anyway, even assuming
    we had an LVDC or a simulation of an LVDC in which to run it.&nbsp;
    That doesn't reduce its instructional value any, though, and it
    doesn't mean that some enterprising individual couldn't fix it up
    now to make it work!<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><a href="LVDC-206RAM-teaser.jpg"><img alt=""
          title="Click to enlarge" src="small-LVDC-206RAM-teaser.jpg"

    </div>
    <br>
    <a name="Skype"></a>When I say "we" have a copy of this assembly
    listing, however, there's an unfortunate proviso.&nbsp; In the U.S.
    there is something called the International Traffic in Arms
    Regulations (ITAR), which prevents export of certain technologies
    from the U.S. except under strict controls.&nbsp; Under my
    non-expert, non-lawyer reading of the ITAR, the LVDC would be such a
    device whose export is prohibited.&nbsp; However, I cannot
    personally figure out whether the LVDC's <i>software</i> would also
    therefore be restricted.&nbsp; If it were restricted, then freely
    providing the software online would be regarded as "exporting" it,
    and would therefore also be prohibited!<br>
    <p>As it happens, the source code from the assembly-listing printout
      has been entirely transcribed into machine readable form.&nbsp;
      That's a lot more convenient to deal with that scanned page
      images, since you can do things like text searches on it, or even
      assemble it using the nifty new LVDC assembler I've written (<a
        href="LVDC.html#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">see below</a>).&nbsp;










































      The problem, of course, is that the transcribed source code is
      just as much subject (or hopefully, it will eventually turn out, <i>not</i>
      subject) to ITAR export restrictions as the scanned images are, so
      this LVDC source code is not presently available in our software
      repository.<br>
    </p>
    Yes, I know that all sounds very silly, since there haven't been any
    Saturns since 1973, so nobody is likely to load one of them up with
    a warhead and fire it at anybody ... and never would have anyway,
    due to the tremendous cost involved.&nbsp; And this software
    couldn't target anything on the ground anyway, since its sole
    purpose is to get stuff into orbit.&nbsp; Nevertheless, although the
    law may be an ass (with apologies to Charles Dickens), it is still
    the law.&nbsp; Until this uncertainty about the ITAR status of the
    LVDC software is cleared up, I am forced to regard it as being
    restricted.&nbsp; According to wikipedia, that means that I am
    allowed to give it to only a "<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_person">United
      States person</a>".&nbsp; Therefore, if you want the program
    listing, you must obtain it from me personally and provide <a
href="https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/proof-us-citizenship-and-identification-when-applying-a-job">proof</a>
    that you are a United States person as just described. I will retain
    a record of everyone to whom I the program listing.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    With all that unpleasantness out of the way, it doesn't seem to me
    that suitably-abridged subsets of the assembly listing would be
    restricted by ITAR, if they do not pertain to guidance, control, or
    other technical aspects of the launch vehicle.&nbsp; <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaASM.py/sample-1967.lvdc">Such










































      an abridged transcription of the source code does indeed appear in
      our software repository</a>. &nbsp; The transcribed code, unlike
    the full program, assembles without error and could actually be run
    on an LVDC or LVDC simulator ... or at least could be run once I
    flesh it out enough to do something useful.&nbsp; That's an evolving
    effort, so feel free to take or leave the abridged LVDC code as you
    see fit.<br>
    <br>
    (Alternately, some of the points I make in the following discussion
    are probably illustrated equally well by the non-flight PAST program
    discussed in <a href="#PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program">the next
      section</a>, which is not restricted by ITAR and hence can be
    viewed in full by everybody.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I didn't have a
    copy of the PAST program, or even know of its existence, when I
    wrote the following description.)<br>
    <br>
    Since the abridged source code is, as I mentioned, a work in
    progress, I can't really base a discussion on it without the burden
    of having to update the discussion frequently.&nbsp; So for the sake
    of discussion, let's just work with the scanned page image.&nbsp;
    Here are various images of pages of the assembly listing that
    illustrate things like how constants and variables are defined by
    the software, how some standard mathematical functions are encoded,
    and some of the tabular data generated by the assembler:<br>

    There's some additional <a href="#ANATOMY">description of the
      anatomy of these assembly listings</a> farther down on this page.<br>
    <p>The middle group of pages above shows a few auxiliary subroutines
      for computing the sine, cosine, arctangent, and spare root
      functions, plus a 3×3 matrix-multiply routine.&nbsp; Note that
      these are some of the very algorithms described in section 13 of <a
href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/satinstunitibm_5.pdf">the
        EDD (LVDC Equation Defining Document)</a>, so the source code
      can actually be compared to the defining documentation if one so
      desired.&nbsp; The two images at the top show an area of the
      program where some constants are defined, while the two at the
      bottom show a portion of the assembly listing's cross-reference
      table.&nbsp; <br>

    Additionally, each of the flown Saturns is associated with a report
    known as its "launch vehicle flight evaluation report", and <a
      href="links.html#lvfea">these reports are available for <i>most</i>
      of the missions</a>, though there are a few gaps.&nbsp; Chapter 2
    of each of the reports divides the mission into a set of "time
    bases", called T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>5</sub>, T<sub>5A</sub>,
    T<sub>6</sub>, ..., T<sub>9</sub>, and each time base itself
    consists of a series of events that are supposed to occur at
    different times.&nbsp; For example, time base T<sub>0</sub> is
    always the "Guidance Reference Release", and comprises events such
    as "S-IC Engine Start Sequence Command", "S-IC Engine No. 1 Start",
    and so on.&nbsp; But in general, not all missions use all of the
    time bases, and the time bases aren't necessarily used for the same
    thing on different missions.<sub><br>
      <br>
    </sub> As noted above, we're pretty sure that for Apollo 12 and
    beyond, a single Generalized Flight Program (GFP) was used, but we
    have no good information about preceding missions.&nbsp; By
    examining the time bases on a mission-by-mission basis, it's
    possible to roughly deduce which missions <i>may</i> have flown
    with the same LVDC software (though with differing preloaded
    constants) vs the missions which must necessarily have used a
    different revision of the LVDC software.&nbsp; Thanks to Nik Beug
    for pointing this out.&nbsp; While such an analysis has not been
    done comprehensively, a rough analysis of the gross similarities in
    the time bases might indicate the need for at least the following
    additional LVDC software revisions other than the GFP:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>... prior? ...<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-501 (Apollo 4)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-502 (Apollo 6)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-503 (Apollo 8)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-504 (Apollo 9)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-505 and 506 (Apollo 10-11)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regarding preloaded constants for LVDC memory, all missions (I
      think!) were associated with a report called the "launch vehicle
      operational flight trajectory", and these documents (among other
      things) listed the LVDC preload settings.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
      most of these reports are presently unavailable, though <a
        href="links.html#Miscellaneous_Mission_Documents">we do have a
        few of them</a>.&nbsp; For example, the AS-202 report says that
      "LVDC symbol" T<sub>1i</sub>, the time-to-go for first IGM stage,
      is preloaded with 299.25 sec, while Vex<sub>1</sub>, the J2
      exhaust velocity for first IGM stage, is loaded with 4165.45
      m/sec, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I claimed earlier that the AS-206RAM Flight Program is
      not, of itself, a complete program.&nbsp; In that assessment, I'm
      not referring to the fact that when you try to assemble it you
      find that there are a few missing symbols, associated with
      variables that haven't been allocated.&nbsp; <i>That</i> problem
      is simply due to the fact that the listing we have is an
      engineering version of the code that had never been debugged to
      the point of being released.&nbsp; It's quite easy, I think, to
      fix up the assembly-time errors and warnings in the AS-206RAM so
      that it assembles error-free, and is entirely self-contained in
      that sense.&nbsp; But it is still not complete in the larger sense
      I mean.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Rather, when I say that AS-206RAM is incomplete, I mean that it
      references code at specific hard-coded addresses which are not
      defined by the AS-206RAM program.&nbsp; Indeed, there are large
      areas of core memory left undefined by the program.&nbsp; Even the
      location in memory at which the power-up entry point should be
      stored is left undefined.&nbsp; But for example, consider the
      concrete example of the code necessary for processing commands
      uploaded to the LVDC from mission control, as described in <a
        href="#Up-data">the Up-data section of this web-page</a>.&nbsp;
      When such a command is uploaded to the LVDC, an interrupt
      occurs.&nbsp; The software then looks in an interrupt-vector
      table, which appears on p. 207 of the program listing, and looks
      like the following:<br>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="iptable206RAM.jpg" alt="" width="957"
        height="242"><br>
    </p>
    What the interrupt-vector table contains is <tt>HOP</tt>
    instructions that cause control to be transferred to the routines
    for servicing the various interrupt types ... in this case, an
    uploaded-command interrupt, the instruction that will be executed is
    <tt>HOP HCCMDC</tt>.&nbsp; The symbol <tt>HCCMDC</tt> refers to a
    variable that holds a HOP constant defining the location in memory
    and the data-memory setup for the appropriate interrupt-service
    routine, as defined on p. 20 of the listing:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="hccmdc206RAM.jpg" alt="" width="885"
        height="93"><br>
      <div align="left"><br>
        In other words, the interrupt-service routine for a
        command-upload is in memory module 4, sector 17, and its entry
        point is syllable 1 of location 267.&nbsp; Similarly, the
        data-memory environment associated with that interrupt-service
        routine is module 4, sector 17.<br>
        <br>
        And yet ... the source code contains no code in module 4, sector
        17.&nbsp; Indeed, module 4 sector 17 does not even appear at all
        in the octal listing of the assembled AS-206RAM code.&nbsp; Some
        initialization routines do actually <i>dynamically</i>
        initialize a handful of constants in that sector, but they
        certainly do not seem to put any code at those locations.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus if a command-upload interrupt were to occur, the result
        would be that the software jumped into the middle of a no-man's
        land of uninitialized memory.&nbsp; And it's not just the
        command-upload interrupt, you can see from the image above that
        other no-man's-land jumps could occur as well:&nbsp; to the
        self-test program, to the hardware evaluation program, or upon
        telemetry-station acquisition.<br>
        <br>
        My inference from all that is that there is a separately
        assembled program which provides the code in those locations,
        and <a href="#Preflight_Program">as discussed earlier</a>, the
        best candidate for that at the moment is the Preflight Program
        ... for which we have no source code and no description
        whatsoever.<br>
        <br>
        That's not to say that AS-206RAM cannot be run, if LVDC emulator
        software were to become available.&nbsp; One workaround for this
        specific problem is to simply modify the interrupt-vector table
        to contain a <tt>HOP HCIRTN</tt> instruction in place of the <tt>HOP









          HCCMDC</tt> instruction it contains now.&nbsp; Another
        workaround would be to simply disable the command-upload
        interrupt.&nbsp; But alas, that's just one example of the
        potential range of problems the missing Preflight Program might
        cause.&nbsp; Until a complete survey of all jumps into no-man's
        land is made, it's impossible to know yet whether all of them
        can be worked around so easily.<br>

          section concerns the "PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program", the only
          LVDC program other than the AS206-RAM Flight Program of which
          we have a copy.&nbsp; Since "PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program" is
          quite a mouthful, I'll just refer to it as the PAST
          program.&nbsp; Not only is that nice and short, it's also apt
          since the PAST program chronologically preceded the AS206-RAM
          Flight Program discussed in the preceding section. &nbsp;<img
            src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; But
          beware:&nbsp; The acronym "PAST" is mine, and doesn't come
          from the contemporary Apollo documentation.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, the PAST program is actually not "LVDC"
          software, and it is certainly not <i>flight</i>
          software.&nbsp; But it's really quite significant in spite of
          that, and shouldn't be ignored if you're interested
          technically in the LVDC itself, rather than merely how the
          LVDC fits into the context of the launch vehicle.&nbsp; The
          PAST program fills in an important gaps in our understanding
          of the LVDC and it is technically so close to being "LVDC
          software" that it's really a matter of opinion as to whether
          you want to label it as LVDC software or not.&nbsp;
          (Hint:&nbsp; I <i>do</i> want to call it that.)&nbsp; Let's
          begin the explanation with a little acronym-rich terminology:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The PTC ("Programmable Test Controller"), pictured to the
            right, was ground-based IBM Federal Systems Division
            equipment for evaluating the LVDC and/or LVDA, using either
            the ADAPT or the ASTEC laboratory test equipment. <br>
          </li>
          <li>The ADAPT ("Aerospace Data Adapter/Processor Tester"), in
            turn, was equipment to evaluate the LVDA.</li>
          <li>The ASTEC ("Aerospace System Test And Evaluation Console")
            was equipment to evaluate the LVDC and LVDA separately or to
            evaluate the LVDC/LVDA integration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf">The PTC is
            documented here</a>. (<a
            href="Documents/19730064186_1973064186.pdf">A tiny bit of
            ADAPT and ASTEC documentation is here</a>.)&nbsp; This PTC
          documentation includes (in Chapter 7) a printout of the
          assembly listing of the PAST program and is our only-known
          source for it.<br>
        </p>
        <p>But it's not necessary to go into great detail about the PTC,
          ADAPT, and ASTEC at the moment.&nbsp; Indeed, for our
          immediate purposes, we can ignore the ADAPT and ASTEC entirely
          and the only important things to know about the PTC are:<br>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The PTC contains a CPU ... <i>which is a modified LVDC</i>.&nbsp;
















            In saying this, I don't mean that the PTC has a modified
            LVDC mounted in it, but rather that the PTC's CPU is a
            reimplementation (albeit modified) of an LVDC CPU.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The PTC's CPU runs software ... in this case, the PAST
            program.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In some sense, you can think of the PTC as a large LVDC that
          has been fixed up to allow various kinds of debugging
          activities.&nbsp; For example, the PTC provides support via
          circuitry enabling things like single-stepping through the
          software.&nbsp; (In the PTC documentation, see section 2-80,
          "External Control Element"; section 2-216, "External Control
          Logic Circuits".)&nbsp; It's the fact that the PTC's CPU is a
          "modified" LVDC which means the PAST program is not strictly
          LVDC software.&nbsp; Rather, it's modified-LVDC
          software.&nbsp; Still, except for small list of differences
          I'll list in a minute, the PAST program matches LVDC Flight
          Program syntax.&nbsp; Indeed, its assembly listing has clearly
          been produced by the LVDC assembler program, although there
          are a few differences in the way some of the output is
          formatted.&nbsp; In terms of how the PTC's CPU has been
          "modified" relative to the LVDC, those changes are described
          in detail later but here's a list of some of the differences
          visible at the software level, though admittedly it may not be
          too meaningful to you until you study more about how the LVDC
          works (and particularly its instruction set) later on:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The HOP register is parsed into fields slightly
            differently.<br>
          </li>
          <li>LVDC CPU instructions eliminated in the PTC CPU:&nbsp; <tt>MPY</tt>
            and <tt>MPH</tt> (both of which are multiplication
            instructions), <tt>DIV</tt> (divide), and <tt>EXM</tt>
            ("execute modified").</li>
          <li> Instructions added to the PTC but not present in
            LVDC:&nbsp; <tt>PRS</tt> (printer operation) and <tt>CIO</tt>
            (CPU i/o control).</li>
          <li>Instructions that are a little different:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><tt>CDS</tt> (set data sector) and <tt>RSU</tt>
              (reverse subtract) have the same functionality as for
              LVDC, but their instruction words coded slightly
              differently.</li>
            <li><tt>SHF</tt> (logical shift) remains similar, but no
              longer has a "clear accumulator" function and can shift by
              up to 6 positions (rather than just by 1 or 2).</li>
            <li><tt>XOR</tt> and <tt>RSU</tt> (reverse subract) use
              different opcodes than the LVDC does, but are otherwise
              identical.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Other:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a single "residual" memory sector, in memory
              module 0, serving all memory modules.&nbsp; (Whereas the
              LVDC has a separate residual sector for each memory
              module.)<br>
            </li>
            <li>Boot:&nbsp; Execution begins at memory module 0, sector
              0, syllable 0, location 0.&nbsp; (Whereas for the LVDC,
              module 0, sector 0, location 0 contains an address at
              which execution should begin.)</li>
            <li>The assembler has a few non-LVDC pseudo-ops it
              recognizes, and few LVDC pseudo-ops which it does
              not.&nbsp; For example, the PTC has an <tt>ORG</tt>
              (origin) pseudo-op where the LVDC has the
              functionally-equivalent <tt>ORGDD</tt> pseudo-op. <br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>How can I justify my claim that the PAST program is
          "significant" and thus deserves your attention?&nbsp; There
          are actually quite a few reasons to think so:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>As self-test software, significant chunks of the program
            are devoted to testing the CPU instructions themselves;
            i.e., deep, system-level self-test code which is not present
            in the AS206-RAM Flight Program.&nbsp; In AGC terms, the
            PAST program most resembles our "Validation Test Suite"
            program ... except that being instead of being written by
            the Virtual AGC Project (as the Validation Test Suite was,
            because MIT/IL itself hadn't left us any AGC self-test
            software as far as we could determine at the time), the PAST
            program was actually supplied by the IBM Federal Systems
            Division itself.&nbsp; This will obviously be very helpful
            in validating any eventual LVDC CPU emulator we may be able
            to come up with, since developers of emulations are always
            faced with uncomfortable questions about the accuracy those
            emulations.&nbsp; Unfortunately, experience with the AGC
            suggests that the <i>most</i>-interesting CPU instructions
            to check would have been the very instructions which the PTC
            omits from its repertoire, and therefore the PAST software
            cannot test them.&nbsp; But that's a minor quibble.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
          <li>Indeed, speaking of LVDC-CPU emulation, running the PAST
            program in an LVDC emulation should in some ways be even
            more convenient than running an LVDC flight program, since
            (as a black box) the LVDC itself has no user interface as
            such, although you could consider its telemetered data
            streams as being a kind of "user interface".&nbsp; Whereas
            the PTC <i>does</i> have a user interface of sorts,
            including a plotter, printer, typewriter (keyboard), various
            electronic displays, and switches. Thus the learning curve
            for seeing an emulated LVDC actually <i>do something</i> is
            much gentler for the PAST program than it would be for an
            LVDC flight program, since the normal behavior of the PAST
            program is already to interact with the test
            technician.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
          <li>Nor is the PAST program a light-weight in terms of size,
            being nearly 60% the size of the AS206-RAM Flight Program,
            both in terms of page-count of source code and in terms of
            the size of the assembled executable.&nbsp; The structure of
            the PAST program is quite simple, which means that much of
            its bulk is related to repetition and variation of simple
            blocks of code rather than to complexity of software
            structure.&nbsp; Pedagogically, I suppose you could argue
            the latter point as being either an disadvantage or an
            advantage, depending on your point of view.<br>
          </li>
          <li>And there's no question of the PAST program's "export"
            being restricted by ITAR:&nbsp; It isn't, since it can't
            even be run within the launch vehicle's computer!&nbsp; So
            it can be freely provided to you, and you need not (please
            don't!) apply personally to me to get access to it (as you
            still have to do for the AS206-RAM Flight Program).&nbsp;
            Just follow the links given below.<br>
          </li>
          <li>An additional bonus is that while the AS206-RAM assembly
            listing we've obtained is simply a snapshot of work of
            ancient work in progress, which cannot even be assembled
            error-free without a bit of massaging, the PAST program is
            unambiguously a mature, debugged, working program.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As far as the versioning of the software, there is nothing
          embedded within the assembly listing itself which dates
          it.&nbsp; However, given that it is printed in the PTC
          document mentioned above, which is dated 5 MARCH 1965, I think
          we can tentatively suppose that the PAST program too is from
          early 1965.&nbsp; (Whereas the AS206-RAM program is from late
          1967.)<br>
        </p>
        <p>Beyond that, there's also the academic question of the
          versioning of the LVDC assembler used.&nbsp; Both the feature
          set and the format of the output is more primitive in the PAST
          assembly than in the AS206-RAM assembly.&nbsp; For all these
          reasons, it's fair to infer that an earlier version of the
          assembler was used for the PTC assembly, in which various
          more-advanced convenience features did not yet exist.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The PAST program's source code has been transcribed into
          textual form, so that it can be <a
            href="#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">assembled</a>.&nbsp;









          You can get that source code from our software repository:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/PTC-ADAPT-Self-Test-Program">Folder






























            in our GitHub repository for PAST program source-code files</a></p>
        <p>I should note that while this code assembles 100% correctly —
          i.e., without errors, and producing octal executables 100%
          identical to those of the original scanned assembly listing —
          there were nevertheless some behaviors (and perhaps bugs) of
          the original assembler that I've not yet been able to figure
          out how to mimic in the modern assembler.&nbsp; Thus to get an
          assembled output identical to the original, some workaround
          code consisting of a handful of <tt>ORG</tt>, <tt>DOG</tt>,
          and <tt>TRA</tt> pseudo-ops and instructions have been
          inserted into the source code.&nbsp; Hopefully it will be
          possible to update the modern assembler at some point in the
          future, and thus eliminate the workarounds.<br>
        </p>
        <p>You can also look at the scanned assembly listing created by
          the Apollo-era assembler.&nbsp; To make it a little more
          convenient to work with, I've extracted the listing from the
          original scanned PTC document linked earlier, so that it can
          be viewed as a set of image files, one per scanned page of the
          listing:<br>

    Among these, it would be fair to state that reference #3 was used
    primarily (the instruction set is covered in table 2-8 on pp. 2-16
    through 2-20), and the others were used to cross-check or to provide
    guidance or information missing from reference #3.&nbsp; (In
    retrospect, however, I would recommend reference #4 as a better
    starting point to those readers who don't find <i>my</i> musings

      Characteristics of the Computer<br>
    </h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 1371px;
        height: 771px;" alt="" src="LVDC-block-diagram.jpg" width="1371"
        height="771"><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> The illustration above shows a
        simplified block diagram of the LVDC.&nbsp; The device itself
        was designed and manufactured by IBM Federal Systems
        Division.&nbsp; Mechanically, the LVDC had dimensions of about
        29.5"×12.5"×10.5", and weighed about 72.5 pounds.&nbsp; A number
        of different power supplies were needed:&nbsp; +6V, -3V, +12V,
        and +20V, at roughly 150W.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        However, the LVDC and the Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA)
        really operated as a pair, and neither is of use without the
        other, so in considering the mechanical and electrical
        characteristics of the LVDC one really needs to include those of
        those of the LVDA into their thinking.&nbsp; The LVDA had
        dimensions of about TBD"×TBD"×TBD", and weighed about 214
        pounds.&nbsp; Its electrical budget was about 320W and it
        accepted +28V power.&nbsp; The purpose of the LVDA was basically
        to intermediate between the LVDC and the remainder of the
        rocket.<br>
        <br>
        In computer terms, LVDC had the following characteristics:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>The computer was triply redundant, with 3 identical
            circuits conforming to the block diagram shown above.&nbsp;
            There was a "voting" circuit not shown, and any two of the 3
            sub-systems could outvote the other on every output control
            signal.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory was ferrite core and was entirely RAM.&nbsp; In
            other words, there was no ROM memory as there was in the
            AGC.&nbsp; This meant that the flight program could
            theoretically be changed much closer to flight time than
            could the program of the AGC, but it also meant that the
            program contained within the computer could be destroyed
            much more easily than with the AGC.&nbsp; (But remember, the
            operating life of the LVDC was very short compared to that
            of the AGC.)&nbsp; Actually, reading RAM based on ferrite
            cores is inherently destructive, so every read must be
            accompanied by a write-back operation to restore the
            contents of memory.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory words were 28 bits, with 2 of those bits being for
            parity, and thus the data portion of memory words was only
            26 bits.&nbsp; Memory was accessed serially, at a 512K
            bits/second rate, though this fact is not relevant as far as
            software coding is concerned.</li>
          <li>Each memory word was logically subdivided into two 14-bit
            "syllables" (13 data bits + 1 parity bit), and computer
            instructions were encoded in 13 bits.&nbsp; Therefore, each
            memory word could hold two computer instructions, one in
            each syllable.&nbsp; Data, on the other hand, required a
            complete word.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The total amount of memory varied from mission to mission,
            I believe.&nbsp; The LVDC could be populated with up to 8
            modules of memory, with each module comprising 16 "sectors"
            of 256 words each (4096 words), for a maximum of 32768
            words.&nbsp; One word in each block wasn't memory as such
            but was a mirror of the CPU's Product-Quotient Register (see
            below), so the usable memory in each block was really only
            4095 words.&nbsp;<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory could be operated in two different modes, under
            program control, called "simplex" and "duplex".&nbsp; In
            "duplex" mode, the memory was divided into two banks, each
            of which was an identical mirror of the other in order to
            improve reliability, whereas in "simplex" mode the memory
            wasn't redundant in this way (though it was still triply
            redundant as mentioned above) but the number of memory words
            was double.&nbsp; In duplex mode, the odd-numbered modules
            mirrored the even-numbered modules, so that one would
            typically used only modules 0, 2, 4, and 6 in duplex
            mode.&nbsp; For the AS-206RAM LVDC Flight Program, a simplex
            model was required.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The basic CPU clock was 2048 KHz, but computer
            instructions were executed in a "computer cycle" time which
            was 82.03125μs.&nbsp; The latter may seem like an unusual
            number, but where it comes from is that each instruction
            required reading/writing 3 syllables (1 holding the
            instruction and 2 holding the data) of 14 bits each, with
            each bit requiring 4 clocks to process. 3×14×4=168, so the
            computer cycle was 168/(2.048MHz)=82.03125μs.&nbsp; Although
            most instructions took a single computer cycle, some
            instructions (particularly multiplication and division) took
            longer.&nbsp; The longest instruction, <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">MPH</span>,
            took 5 cycles.&nbsp; The <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>
            instructions (see below) theoretically took only a single
            cycle, but could only begin their operations in that amount
            of time, and the results weren't accessible until later (4
            cycles total for <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and 8 cycles total for
            <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>).<br>
          </li>
          <li>Arithmetic was 2's complement, integer only.</li>
          <li>There were two arithmetic units, one of which could
            perform addition, subtractions, and logical operations,
            whilst the other could perform multiplication and
            division.&nbsp; The two units could be operated
            independently, which is significant because multiplications
            required 4 computer cycles and divisions required 8 computer
            cycles, and instruction execution could continue while the
            multiplication or division proceeded.&nbsp; In other words,
            one could begin a multiplication or division, proceed to
            execute some unrelated instructions, and then later fetch
            the results of completed multiplication or division.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    The CPU had the following additional registers not addressable as
    normal memory:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Accumulator Register.</li>
      <li>The Product-Quotient Register (or just P-Q Register) can be
        accessed at address 0775 (octal) regardless of which memory
        modules and sectors were currently selected.&nbsp; (This happens
        to be an address in the "residual sector", as described below,
        so it represents a single address in each memory module rather
        than an address within each memory sector.)&nbsp; However, it is
        used by the <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>
        instructions (see below) and therefore cannot be treated as an
        ordinary memory location.</li>
      <li>The HOP Register, discussed further below.</li>
      <li>... and various hidden registers not directly relevant to
        software:&nbsp; the Transfer Register, the Address Register, the
        Data Module Register, the Data Sector Register, the Instruction
        Sector Register, the Operation Code Register, and the Memory
        Buffer Registers.</li>
    </ul>
    There are some memory words in the "residual sector" (see below)
    that are real memory (unlike 0775), but nevertheless have special
    purposes and so should be avoided for general usage:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>0400 stores a HOP Register code (see below) for vectoring to
        interrupts.<br>
      </li>
      <li>0600, 0640, 0700, 0740 are used for the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
        instruction (see below).</li>
      <li>0776, 0777 are used for the "HOP save" feature (see below).</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, at boot-up time:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>LVDC:&nbsp; Address 000—I believe, in module 0 sector 0 but am
        not sure—stores a HOP Register code loaded at reset. <br>
      </li>
      <li> PTC:&nbsp; Execution seems to simply begin at module 0,
        sector 0, syllable 0, location 0.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Memory Words</h3>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 896px; height:
        166px;" alt="" src="LVDC-BitPositions.jpg" width="896"
        height="166"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The illustration above depicts the data organization within a memory
    word.&nbsp;&nbsp; For numeric data, there is a sign bit (designated
    "S" in the illustration), with the bit labeled "1" being the
    most-significant bit and the bit labeled "25" being the
    least-significant bit.&nbsp; For non-numeric data, the bits were
    designated instead as "1" through "26", with no overlap between the
    designation of the bits for numeric data.&nbsp; A very curious
    system indeed, in modern thinking!<br>
    <br>
    The situation is even curiouser, to paraphrase Alice, when
    considering instructions stored in the syllables in place of numeric
    data.&nbsp; In those cases the bits are interpreted as in the
    following illustration:<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 899px; height:
        169px;" alt="" src="LVDC-InstructionPositions.jpg" width="899"
        height="169"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The instruction in Syllable 0 is processed first, and the
    instruction in Syllable 1 is processed second.&nbsp; In most cases,
    the bits labeled OP1-OP4 contain an instruction code and the bits
    A1-A9 contain an address in the range 0-511 on which the instruction
    operates.&nbsp; There are, however, a few instructions in which A9
    and/or A8 also form a part of the instruction code, in which case
    the addressable range is smaller.&nbsp; Note that bits A1-A9 are
    neither in consecutive order within the memory word, nor are they in
    an order which would be consistent with the ordering of bits in data
    words.<br>
    <br>
    These oddities in bit-ordering are due to the fact that memory was
    read serially into the CPU, so the ordering of the bits is optimized
    to mimic the order in which the CPU needed to use them.<br>
    <br>
    For the purpose of executing instructions, memory is considered as
    being divided into "sectors" of 256 words each.&nbsp; Address bits
    A1-A8 select an offset into a sector, while A9 (known as the
    "residual bit") selects which sector is being addressed.&nbsp; When
    A9 is 0, the currently-selected sector is being addressed, while
    when A9 is 1 a special sector called the "residual sector" is being
    addressed.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The "residual
      sector" is always sector 017 (octal)</span>, in the current memory
    module for LVDC, or in module 0 for PTC.&nbsp; (I.e., the LVDC has a
    separate residual sector in each module, whereas the PTC simply has
    a single residual sector, in module 0, no matter which memory module
    is selected.)&nbsp; Incidentally, the "residual sector" can only be
    used for addressing memory, and there's no way to access
    instructions in it unless it happens to be the currently-selected
    instruction sector as explained in the paragraph that follows.&nbsp;
    In essence, the "residual sector" is good for storing global
    variables whilst the currently-selected data sector is good for
    storing local variables.<br>
    <br>
    Memory-sector selection and the "residual sector" become clearer
    when contemplating the HOP Register mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Here is
    the LVDC's version of the HOP Register:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 868px; height:
        293px;" alt="" src="LVDC-HopRegister.jpg" width="868"
        height="293"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The PTC is simpler than the LVDC, in that it contains a maximum of 2
    memory modules, and has no duplex vs simplex configuration.&nbsp;
    The LVDC's and PTC's HOP Registers are compatible, though at first
    glance it may not seem that they are, due to different numbering
    conventions for the positioning — sign bit vs no sign bit — in the
    images above and below.&nbsp; Here is the PTC's version of the HOP
    Register:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="PTC-HOP.png" alt="" width="846"
        height="163"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The meanings of these fields may already be clear to you, but just
    in case they are not:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Bits IM1-IM3 (not contiguous) select the memory module from
        which instructions are fetched.&nbsp; (Recall that there are up
        to 8 memory modules installed in the LVDC.&nbsp; The PTC has
        only 2.)</li>
      <li>Bit DUPIN selects whether the portion of memory from which
        instructions are fetched is accessed in duplex mode or in
        simplex mode.&nbsp; (Recall that in duplex mode there is only
        half the addressable memory as in simplex mode, because the
        memory is dual-redundant and half of the memory mirrors the
        other half.)</li>
      <li>Bits IS1-IS4 select the 256-word sector within the selected
        memory module from which instructions are fetched.</li>
      <li>Bits A1-A8 (the Instruction Counter) point to the next
        instruction word to be fetched from the selected sector in the
        selected block.</li>
      <li>Bit SYL indicates the next instruction syllable in the next
        instruction word.</li>
      <li>And similarly, bits DM1-DM3, bit DUPDN, and bits DS1-DS4 serve
        analogous purposes except for data words rather than instruction
        words.</li>
    </ul>
    Upon reset, the CPU loads the HOP Register with the value stored at
    address 000 (presumably in memory module 0 sector 0), and this
    determines where program execution starts.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="Dimitris"></a>Below are some photos sent to us by Dimitris
    Vitoris of an LVDC "page assembly".&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't
    know exactly what this particular page assembly does, but don't be
    fooled by the array-like regularity of the design into supposing
    these are memory.&nbsp; They're not, since LVDC memory consisted of
    ferrite cores and not surface-mounted flatpacks.<br>
    <br>
    The term <i>page assembly</i> refers to plug-in modular circuit
    boards used to build the LVDC and LVDA, and not to the specific
    functionality the individual module provides.&nbsp; Each page
    assembly contains a printed circuit board with up to 35 "Unit Logic
    Devices" (ULD) on the top side, and another 35 on the bottom
    side.&nbsp; The ULDs were themselves designed by IBM, rather than
    being off-the-shelf components from other manufacturers; as a
    consequence, there aren't ULD datasheets floating around, and
    there's not a lot of information about them.&nbsp; But here's a
    little info we've been able to glean.&nbsp; Most of the explanations
    about their functionality came from the "Logic Symbols" Appendix of
    <a
href="Documents/LaboratoryMaintenanceInstructionsForLVDC-Volume1-GeneralDescriptionAndTheory.pdf">this




      document</a>, which also describes a number of other symbols that
    may or may not be ULDs as well.<br>
    <ul>

          <td>This instruction combines an unconditional jump
            instruction with various other configuration options, such
            as memory-sector selection.&nbsp; The way it works is that
            the address A1-A9 points to a memory word that contains a
            "HOP constant", and the <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span> instruction transfers
            that HOP constant into the HOP register.&nbsp; Recall that
            A1-A8 select the offset within a 256-word sector, and A9 is
            the "residual bit" that selects between the current sector
            and the "residual sector".&nbsp; There is no provision for a
            partial HOP constant, and the full HOP constant needs to be
            given every time a <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span> instruction is
            used.&nbsp; See also <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">CDS</span> and <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">TRA</span>.<br>
            <br>
            Although the machine instruction requires the address of the
            HOP constant to be provided as its operand, the assembler is
            flexible enough to allow the operand to instead be a
            left-hand symbol for the target location in the code.&nbsp;
            When it encounters this situation, the assembler
            transparently performs a workaround.&nbsp; For the sake of
            discussion, imagine assembly-language code something like
            the following:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt>HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;










































                HIGTHR<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
                HIGTHR&nbsp; ... <i>more code</i> ...<br>
              </tt> </blockquote>
            What the assembler does in a case like this is:<br>
            <ul>
            </ul>
            <ol>
              <li><strike>If the target address </strike><strike>is in
                  the current instruction-memory sector (either in the
                  same or the opposite syllable), transparently replace
                  the </strike><strike><tt>HOP</tt></strike><strike>
                  instruction by a </strike><strike><tt>TRA</tt></strike><strike>
                  instruction.&nbsp; Otherwise, proceed to step 2.</strike><strike><br>
                </strike> </li>
              <li>Allocate a data word in the current data sector.&nbsp;
                Do this by searching upward in the data sector, looking
                for the first unused location.&nbsp; The residual sector
                is searched if there's no room left in the current
                sector.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Create a HOP constant for the target location<tt></tt>,
                and store it in the newly-allocated data word.</li>
              <li>Use the address of the newly-allocated data word as
                the operand for the <tt>HOP</tt> instruction.</li>
            </ol>
            Whenever such a substitution was performed by the assembler,
            it noted it in the assembly listing by printing "<tt>HOP*</tt>"
            as the name of the instruction rather than "<tt>HOP</tt>" as
            what would have been used on the actual punch card.

            This is a multiplication instruction.&nbsp; It multiplies
            two 24-bit numbers to produce a 26-bit product.&nbsp; The
            accumulator provides the address of one operand, and the
            address embedded in the instruction points to the other
            operand.&nbsp; Recall that A1-A8 select the offset within a
            256-word sector, and A9 is the "residual bit" that selects
            between the current sector and the "residual sector".&nbsp;
            In both cases, the most-significant 24-bits of the operands
            are used, and the least-significant 2 bits of the operand
            are ignored.&nbsp; A partial product (24 bits from the
            addressed memory times the 12 less-significant bits from the
            accumulator) can be fetched from the P-Q Register (0775
            octal) on the 2nd instruction (or more accurately, two
            computer cycles) following <span style="font-family:

            is no need to do so if that value isn't desired by the
            program.&nbsp; The full product is available from the
            accumulator or from the P-Q Register on the 4th instruction
            (more accurately, 4 computer cycles) following <span

            accumulator are divided by the operand pointed to by the
            address A1-A9 embedded within the instruction to produce a
            24-bit quotient.&nbsp; Recall that A1-A8 select the offset
            within a 256-word sector, and A9 is the "residual bit" that
            selects between the current sector and the "residual
            sector".&nbsp; The quotient is available in the P-Q Register
            (0775 octal) on the 8th instruction (more accurately, 8
            computer cycles) following the <span style="font-family:

          <td>This is a conditional jump instruction, which branches to
            the address embedded in the instruction if the accumulator
            is not zero, but simply continues to the next instruction in
            sequence if the accumulator is zero.&nbsp; Bits A1-A8 of the
            embedded address represent the new offset within the
            currently selected 256-word instruction sector, while bit A9
            gives the syllable number within that word.&nbsp;&nbsp; The

            As mentioned, the target address for the machine instruction
            itself had to be within the current sector, because its
            8-bit address offset is embedded within the
            instruction.&nbsp; However, the assembler would
            transparently work around this problem, allowing essentially
            <i>any</i> target address to be used.&nbsp; For the sake of
            discussion, imagine an assembly language instruction,<br>
            <blockquote><tt>TNZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OINIT</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            in which the target location <tt>OINIT</tt> is not in the
            current memory sector.&nbsp; The workaround procedure used
            by the assembler was this:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Working downward from the top of the current
                instruction-memory sector, find an unallocated memory
                location.</li>
              <li>In that newly-allocated memory location, put a "<tt>HOP



















































                  OINIT</tt>" instruction.</li>
              <li>Use the newly-allocated memory location as the target
                of the <tt>TNZ</tt> instruction.</li>
              <li>In the assembly listing, display the operator as "<tt>TNZ*</tt>"
                rather than "<tt>TNZ</tt>".&nbsp; (But "<tt>TNZ</tt>" is
                nevertheless what actually appeared on the punch cards.)<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            Of course, this workaround preserves the intended logic, at
            the cost of an extra instruction word and a couple of extra
            machine cycles.<br>

            What about the carry bit?&nbsp; As far as I can tell, the
            CPU has no provision for carry bit that's useful at the
            software level.&nbsp; If you want to do multi-word precision
            arithmetic (say, 52-bit addition instead of just 26-bit
            addition), then you have to find some indirect,
            software-only way of detecting carry rather than on relying
            on the CPU to provide you with some easy way of handling
            it.&nbsp; It's certainly mathematically possible to do
            so:&nbsp; When adding two addends of the <i>same</i> sign
            using 2's-complement arithmetic, you can detect carry
            because the sum has the opposite sign of the addends,
            whereas adding two addends of <i>opposite</i> signs cannot
            result in carry anyway.&nbsp; But the coding to exploit this
            mathematical possibility is obviously going to be cumbersome
            and inconvenient.&nbsp; (The low-level adder circuit itself
            can deal with a carry bit, of course.&nbsp; The adder
            performs additions serially, starting with the
            least-significant bit and moving upward to the
            most-significant, and at each bit-stage there's a carry bit
            from the previous stage to worry about.&nbsp; However, the
            final carry bit is not accessible to software, and the
            carry-bit latch is cleared by any <tt>CLA</tt> instruction,
            making it very tough to transfer the carry-bit latch's
            contents from one word-addition to the next.&nbsp; In
            theory, if you could figure out a way to do multi-precision
            arithmetic without using <tt>CLA</tt>, perhaps you could
            exploit that hidden carry bit.&nbsp; But I'm having trouble
            seeing any way you might do it.&nbsp; That could just be my
            failure of imagination, of course.)<br>

            embedded address represent the new offset within the
            currently selected 256-word instruction sector, while bit A9
            gives the syllable number within that word.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            "residual sector" cannot be accessed.<br>
            <br>
            Note, however, that the <i>assembler</i> transparently
            worked around the limitation that the target address had to
            be in the same sector.&nbsp; The assembler would
            automatically insert a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction instead of
            a <tt>TRA</tt> whenever it found that it was necessary to
            do so.&nbsp; For example, consider the instruction "<tt>TRA
              ETCBTC</tt>".&nbsp; If the target location <tt>ETCBTC</tt>
            is within the current instruction sector, the assembler
            would indeed assemble this exactly as expected, using a <tt>TRA</tt>
            instruction with opcode <tt>1000</tt>.&nbsp; Actually, the
            assembler would refuse to directly do a <tt>TRA</tt> to a
            target in the same instruction sector under some
            circumstances, presumably to help guard the programmer from
            easy-to-make errors.&nbsp; The condition I've noticed in
            which this occurs is if the target address has been tagged
            by the assembler as being in a region with a different
            setting for the <i>data</i> module or sector, since unlike
            a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction, a <tt>TRA</tt> instruction
            doesn't alter the DM/DS settings.&nbsp; Whereas if a <tt>CDS</tt>
            instruction (which changes the DM/DS settings in the
            processor itself) happens to be at the target location, it
            doesn't trigger a replacement by <tt>HOP</tt>.&nbsp; Quite
            a complicated set of conditions! One wonders if the original
            programmers actually had much awareness at the time (or
            cared!) that these substitutions were being made for them.<br>
            <br>
            But if the target location (<tt>ETCBTC</tt> in this example)
            wasn't within the current instruction sector or failed the
            DM/DS conditions, then the assembler would instead perform
            the following complicated maneuver which preserves the
            expected program logic, at the cost of an extra machine
            cycle and an extra word of memory:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Allocate a data word in the current data sector.&nbsp;
                This is done by searching upward through the current
                data sector (or the residual sector, failing that) until
                an unallocated word is found.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Create a HOP constant for the target location <tt>ETCBTC</tt>,
                and store it in the newly-allocated data word.</li>
              <li>Assemble a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction with the
                newly-allocated data word as its operand.</li>
              <li>Whenever such a substitution was performed by the
                assembler, it noted it in the assembly listing by
                replacing "<tt>TRA</tt>" with "<tt>TRA*</tt>".&nbsp;
                However, I think that "<tt>TRA</tt>" is always what
                would have originally been used on the punch card.</li>
              <li><i>Workaround for PTC</i>:&nbsp; For the PTC version
                of the original assembler, I've unfortunately been
                forced to provide hints to the modern assembler
                (yaASM.py) by <i>explicitly</i> using "<tt>TRA*</tt>"
                in the source code when necessary.&nbsp; With either of
                "<tt>TRA</tt>" or "<tt>TRA*</tt>", the modern assembler
                provides a behaviorally-correct fixup, but when "<tt>TRA</tt>"
                is used rather than "<tt>TRA*</tt>", the
                automatically-allocated memory words are at different
                addresses than originally, thus preventing validation of
                the assembler.&nbsp; Deducing the original PTC algorithm
                and thus allowing universal use of "<tt>TRA</tt>" in PTC
                source code is a reverse-engineering problem I have been
                unable to solve so far.&nbsp; (Although, for all <i>I</i>
                know, the PTC programmers may themselves have had to
                explicitly use "<tt>TRA*</tt>" as well.&nbsp; There's no
                available original documentation to answer that question
                one way or the other.)</li>
            </ul>
            This in so far as the assembly-language source code is
            concerned, it seems that one may as well always use <tt>TRA</tt>
            rather than <tt>HOP</tt>, since <tt>TRA</tt> is more
            economical than <tt>HOP</tt>, and the assembler will always
            substitute <tt>HOP</tt> anyway whenever some limitation of
            <tt>TRA</tt> necessitates it.<br>

            <p>The LVDC and PTC cases appear to be very different, but
              the difference is really just that the PTC has no
              multiplication and division instructions, and hence has no
              product-quotient or multiplicand-divisor register.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the description of 776 and 777 above is
              admittedly a bit tricky to understand, so let's try to get
              at it another way.&nbsp; It's mainly about return
              addresses for subroutines and interrupt-service
              routines.&nbsp; Most modern CPU's have a "CALL"
              instruction for calling subroutines, and part of what CALL
              would do is to push the return address onto a dedicated
              "stack" in memory; a subsequent "RET" instruction would
              then pop the return address out of the stack and jump to
              that return address. &nbsp; But the LVDC/PTC CPU has no
              such features ... no CALL, no RET, no stack.&nbsp; What it
              does instead is this:&nbsp; During the process of
              executing any given LVDC/PTC instruction, a HOP constant
              for the LVDC instruction at the <i>next successive memory
                address</i> is formed.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the next
              instruction successively in memory is not necessarily the
              next instruction sequentially executed.&nbsp; Whatever the
              next instruction executed, the previously-generated HOP
              constant is temporarily shoved into a register called
              "HOP-saver".&nbsp; Thus if the very next instruction <i>executed</i>
              after a transfer instruction (<tt>HOP</tt>, <tt>TRA</tt>,
              <tt>TMI</tt>, or <tt>TNZ</tt>) is <tt>STO 776</tt> or <tt>STO







                777</tt>, what ends up getting stored in location 776 or
              777 is the HOP constant for the memory address that
              follows the previously executed transfer instruction
              instruction in memory.&nbsp; Or in brief, for a transfer
              instruction to a subroutine, what gets saved at 776 or 777
              is the return address of the subroutine.&nbsp; In fact,
              this is the only easy method for accessing such return
              addresses, and the only way at all for accessing return
              addresses of interrupt-service routines.<br>
            </p>
            As an example, here's a simple framework for calling an
            LVDC/PTC subroutine:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ...<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                SUB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;







                # Call a subroutine.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
                <br>
                # The subroutine.</tt><br>
              <tt> SUB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                STO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                776&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;







                # Save the return address.</tt><br>
              <tt> </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;







                # ... do stuff ...</tt><br>
              <tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt>HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;







                776
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                # Return from SUB.</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            <tt> </tt>This becomes trickier if you have <i>nested</i>
            subroutine calls, because the nested routines can't each use
            the same storage buffers for their return addresses, and
            there's no way to temporarily replace the contents of
            776/777 while still being able to restore the original
            contents afterward.&nbsp; (You can certainly <i>read</i>
            776/777, for example with <tt>CLA 776</tt>, but you can't
            save an arbitrary value into either 776 or 777
            afterward.)&nbsp; In other words, if you have a nested
            subroutine, you have to manage the return address of the
            parent subroutine manually.&nbsp; Here's an example I've
            constructed to illustrate the method:<br>
            <blockquote>
              <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>

                  1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            You can, of course, perform the same trick with multiple
            levels of nesting, at the cost of allocating more and more
            variables to store the manually-managed return addresses.<br>
            <br>
            It is perhaps obvious as well that the same address (776 vs
            777) should not be used for interrupt-service routines and
            and for regular subroutines, even for the few instruction
            cycles needed for manual management, or else tremendous care
            needs to be taken to insure that no interrupt can occur
            during a subroutine with conflicting storage requirements
            for the return addresses.&nbsp; The safest thing would be to
            use 776 for interrupt-service routines (and their
            subroutines) and 777 for non-interrupt subroutines, or
            vice-versa.&nbsp; In examining the PTC ADAPT Self-Test
            Program and the AS206-RAM Flight Program, the two seem to
            use the opposite choice, so there may not have been a
            customary standard for doing so from one program to the
            next.<br>

            continues to the next instruction in sequence if the
            accumulator greater than or equal to zero.&nbsp; Bits A1-A8
            of the embedded address represent the new offset within the
            currently selected 256-word instruction sector, while bit A9
            gives the syllable number within that word.&nbsp;&nbsp; The

            transparently work around this problem, allowing essentially

                In terms of assembly-language syntax, there are the
                following variations:<br>
                <blockquote><tt>CDS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i></i><i>SYMBOLNAME</i></tt><tt><br>
                  </tt><tt>CDSD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>DM,DS</i></tt><tt><br>
                  </tt><tt>CDSS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>DM,DS</i></tt><br>
                </blockquote>
                Thus <tt>CDS</tt> uses the characteristics of a
                variable name or a name defined with the <tt>DEQD</tt>
                or <tt>DEQS</tt> pseudo-ops (see below), whereas the
                module number and sector number are simply supplied with
                octal numeric literals in <tt>CDSD</tt> or <tt>CDSS</tt>.&nbsp;


















































                The difference between <tt>CDSD</tt> and <tt>CDSS</tt>
                is that the former selects duplex memory while the later
                selects simplex memory.<br>
                <br>
                In the usage I've seen, usage of <tt>CDSS</tt> is
                confined almost entirely to the context of <tt>USE DAT</tt>
                (see below).<br>

            By a "left" shift, we mean a shift toward the
            more-significant direction (multiplying by powers of 2); by
            a "right" shift, we mean a shift toward the less-significant
            direction (dividing by powers of 2).<br>
            <br>
            In terms of assembly-language syntax, I have never seen <tt>SHF</tt>
            itself used.&nbsp; Rather, the synonyms <tt>SHL</tt> (left
            shift) and <tt>SHR</tt> (right shift) are used, and only in
            the following variations:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>SHL <i>N</i></tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>SHR <i>N</i></tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            where <i><tt>N</tt></i> is a literal decimal numerical
            constant.&nbsp; However, <tt>N</tt> is not limited to just
            0, 1, or 2, even those are all that <tt>SHF</tt> directly
            supports.&nbsp; If an operand <i><tt>N</tt></i>&gt;2 is
            encountered, the assembler transparently replaces it with an
            appropriate <i>sequence</i> of shift-by-2 and shift-by-1
            instructions.<br>
            <br>
            Note:&nbsp; The <i>original</i> documentation of the <tt>SHF</tt>
            instruction itself does not actually describe the
            directionality of the shifts, nor the nature of the data
            used to fill the bit-positions vacated by the shift.&nbsp;
            It instead simply refers to the there-undefined terms "MSD
            shift" and "LSD shift".&nbsp; <i> Elsewhere</i> in the
            original documentation is a theory-of-operation for the
            electronic circuitry, and the additional information about
            directionality and fill-values given above is derived from
            the theory of operation.<br>

            In terms of assembly-language syntax, I have never seen <tt>SHF</tt>
            itself used.&nbsp; Rather, the synonyms <tt>SHL</tt> (left
            shift) and <tt>SHR</tt> (right shift) are used, and only in
            the following variations:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>SHL <i>N</i></tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>SHR <i>N</i></tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            where <i><tt>N</tt></i> is a literal decimal numerical
            constant.&nbsp; However, <tt>N</tt> is not limited to just
            1 through 6, even those are all that <tt>SHF</tt> directly
            supports.&nbsp; If an operand <i><tt>N</tt></i>&gt;6 is
            encountered, the assembler transparently replaces it with an
            appropriate <i>sequence</i> of shift-by-6 (or less)
            instructions.<br>
            <br>
            Note:&nbsp; The <i>original</i> documentation of the <tt>SHF</tt>
            instruction itself does not actually describe the
            directionality of the shifts, nor the nature of the data
            used to fill the bit-positions vacated by the shift.&nbsp;
            It instead simply refers to the there-undefined terms "MSD
            shift" and "LSD shift".&nbsp; <i> Elsewhere</i> in the
            original documentation is a theory-of-operation for the
            electronic circuitry, and the additional information about
            directionality and fill-values given above is derived from
            the theory of operation.<br>

            "Execute modified".&nbsp; In baseball terms, this is the
            "infield fly rule" of the LVDC: it clearly does something,
            but upon first acquaintance it's hard to grasp exactly what
            it does.<br>
            <br>
            The <tt>EXM</tt> instruction takes a target instruction
            stored at a different memory location, forms a modified
            operand for that instruction, executes the modified
            instruction, and then continues with the next instruction
            following the <tt>EXM</tt> (unless the program counter has
            been changed by the modified instruction).&nbsp; For this
            instruction, A8 and A9 form a part of the instruction code,
            so only A1-A7 are significant.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            It is important to understand that the target instruction is
            not modified within the LVDC memory; rather, it is modified
            and executed without the modified form of it being stored in
            memory at all.<br>
            <br>
            Only 4 different choices of memory address are allowed to
            contain the target instruction which is to be modified,
            namely 0200, 0240, 0300, and 0340 in the "residual sector"
            in the memory module selected by the current DM (data
            module) bit.&nbsp; (The original documentation does not
            actually indicate whether it is the IM or DM bit that
            selects the particular memory module in which the target
            instruction is stored, and I think that it would be very
            reasonable to suppose that the IM bit is used.&nbsp; But
            from the actual AS206-RAM Flight Program source code, it is
            obvious that DM is the bit which is used.)<br>
            <br>
            Some of the bits in A1-A7 of the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction
            represent various types of modifications to the embedded
            address at the target address rather than themselves being
            address bits.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the interpretations of
            bits A1-A7 found in the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A1-A4 modify the address embedded in the target
                instruction as described below.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A5 indicates the syllable in which the target
                instruction resides in residual memory.</li>
              <li>A7,A6 selects the target address, as follows:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>0,0 for target address 0200</li>
                <li>0,1 for target address 0240</li>
                <li>1,0 for target address 0300</li>
                <li>1,1 for target address 0340</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            To modify the target instruction, its A1-A9 bits are formed
            as follows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A1-A2 come from A1-A2 of the <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">EXM</span>
                instruction.</li>
              <li>A3 is the logical OR of the A3 of the target
                instruction and A3 of the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction.</li>
              <li>A4 is the logical OR of the A4 of the target
                instruction and A4 of the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction.</li>
              <li>A5-A8 come from A5-A8 of the target instruction, and
                remain unchanged.</li>
              <li>A9 becomes 0, thus the target instruction cannot be
                either <tt>EXM</tt> or <tt>SHF/SHR/SHL</tt>.&nbsp;
                (The original documentation does not actually say
                anything about how the target instruction's A9 is
                modified, but if it were allowed to remain 1, the
                data-sector discussion which immediately follows would
                not make sense.)<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The data sector used when the target instruction is executed
            is also changed for the duration of that one instruction, as
            determined by bits A1, A2, and A9 of the unmodified target
            instruction, as follows:<br>

    My understanding of this is sketchy right now, so take anything I
    have to say with a grain of salt.&nbsp; <br>
    <p>Note that the LVDC code is self-modifying, and thus ports that
      don't explicitly appear in the source code may actually be
      accessed at runtime, while ports that do explicitly appear in the
      code may be changed to something else before having a chance to be
      accessed at runtime.&nbsp; For example, on p. 227 of the AS206-RAM
      source code (look at labels <tt>MLDBUX</tt>, <tt>MLDBUY</tt>,
      and <tt>MLDBUZ</tt>), there's self-modifying code that changes an
      instruction <tt>PIO 203</tt> to a <tt>PIO 303</tt>, then changes
      it to a <tt>PIO 273</tt>, and then finally changes it back to <tt>PIO





        203</tt>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with programming and
      documentation practices like these, getting a complete list of
      ports used — other than by just running the code under all
      possible combinations of conditions and recording what happens —
      is a tough proposition.&nbsp; (That's not intended as a criticism
      of the programming practices IBM FSD had back in 1967 ... but it
      goes to show why, <i>today</i>, there are reasons that practices
      such as these are frowned upon.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>At any rate, here is a table of ports from the original
      documentation, though massaged a bit by me.<br>

                            positions 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, and 20 of the
                            accumulator data word.&nbsp; I'm not sure
                            how this differs from <tt>CIO 210</tt> (see
                            next section).&nbsp; In fact, the
                            source-code comment in the PAST program even
                            mentions <tt>CIO 210</tt>. I believe these
                            are the same 6 bits which can be read back
                            with CIO 214 (bits 22-17) when appropriately
                            gated.<br>

                            It's not clear to me whether this

                            to the latch, or whether it XOR's the mask
                            to the latch; I presume the former.&nbsp; In
                            the AS206RAM Flight Program's source code, <tt>PIO





                              672</tt> is used in memory module 2, and
                            address 672 translates to 2-17-272, which is
                            the variable <tt>IHBT</tt>.&nbsp; I infer
                            that the technique for temporarily

                              <li>Write the mask out to the

      Instruction)</h3>
    <p>Figure 2-11 of <a href="Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf">the








        original PTC documentation</a> gives a list of i/o ports
      employed by the PTC's <tt>CIO</tt> instruction.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, by my count, 137 different <tt>CIO</tt> ports are
      used just within the PAST program, while the documentation lists
      only 35 of them.&nbsp; The following is a table of <i>all</i>
      known <tt>CIO</tt> ports, including not only those listed in the
      original documentation, but also those found in the source code of
      the PAST program.&nbsp; Sometimes the functionality of a port
      referenced <i> only</i> in the PAST program is easily inferred
      from comments in the source code, so I've supplied my inferences
      in the table below, while in other cases I haven't yet deduced
      that functionality.&nbsp; In other words, as usual, this is a work
      in progress!&nbsp; Port numbers whose descriptions were pasted
      from the original documentation are in <b>bold text</b>, to
      distinguish them from those whose functionality has merely been
      inferred.<br>

            occurs.&nbsp; The other bits in <tt>ACC</tt> may be the bit
            pattern against which the comparison is made.&nbsp; I would
            suggest further that the the "compare latch" referred to is
            the Address Compare (ADR COMP) latch, discussed on p. V-2-69
            of the PTC documentation, so that the contents of <tt>ACC</tt>
            would be something like a HOP constant.&nbsp; A perhaps
            illustrative usage in the PAST program code is found at
            label <tt>L9P36</tt>, shortly after which we find <tt>ACC</tt>
            indeed being loaded with the HOP constant (for location <tt>L9P36</tt>),





            and then output via <tt>CIO 066</tt>.&nbsp; A similar
            sequence of code occurs at label <tt>L10P33</tt>.&nbsp; On
            the other hand, this interpretation is inconsistent with the
            notion that the SIGN bit must be non-zero to enable
            comparisons, since <tt>L9P36</tt>'s HOP constant has a SIGN
            bit of 0, so perhaps more thought is required to unravel
            what this operation is doing.<br>

            switches which are part of the PTC's Processor Display

            original documentation is by no means clear, but here is my
            interpretation of its explanations.<br>
            <br>
            Except for the toggles I mark below as GATED, the states of
            the switches are simply read directly by <tt>CIO 214</tt>,
            with OFF (down) giving 0 and ON (up) giving 1.&nbsp; The
            interpretations are therefore software-dependent and
            essentially arbitrary.&nbsp; There are a few cases in which
            the PAST program uses certain toggles in a systematic way,
            and those are indicated below.<br>
            <br>
            In contrast, the GATED toggles are read as 1 when ON, but
            when OFF allow the CPU to instead read signals generated
            elsewhere in the PTC, which could each be either 0 or 1 at
            any given time.&nbsp; <br>

      Linkage</h3>
    While the LVDC is executing an instruction, it is also forming the
    HOP constant of the next instruction in sequence—i.e., on the
    assumption that no branch occurs—and this HOP constant is available
    to the next instruction that executes.&nbsp; In most cases, this
    means that an instruction can find out its own address (which isn't
    very interesting), but if the previous instruction was a branch then
    it means that the current instruction can determine the address of
    the instruction in sequence that followed the branch instruction,
    and thus can use this information for setting up returns from
    subroutines.&nbsp; The instruction for fetching that HOP constant
    and saving it is either <span style="font-family: courier
      new,courier,monospace;">STO 0776</span> or <span
      style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">STO 0777</span>.&nbsp;

    those special addresses work.&nbsp; So a typical subroutine linkage
    would look like this:<br>

    <h3><a name="Interrupts" id="Interrupts"></a>Interrupts</h3>
    <h4><a name="Interrupts_of_LVDC"></a>Interrupts of LVDC</h4>
    There are up to 12 external interrupt sources, buffered by the
    LVDA.&nbsp; Upon any of these becoming active, the LVDA generates a
    master interrupt signal to the LVDC.&nbsp; When the LVDC receives
    the master interrupt signal, assuming that interrupts have not been
    programmatically inhibited, the following actions occur:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The LVDC automatically masks that particular interrupt from
        occurring again until explicitly reenabled (at step 9 below).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The LVDC allows any instruction, multiplication, or division
        in progress to complete.</li>
      <li>The LVDC performs a <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0400</span>, thus transferring
        control to an interrupt-service routine—or, as the original
        documents refer to it, an "input-output subprogram".&nbsp;
        Recall that this does not jump to address 0400, rather it loads
        the HOP Register from the value stored at address 0400, and this
        can be used to jump to a location, set the current memory module
        and sector, etc.&nbsp; (Early non-flight hardware seemingly used
        a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP
          0776</span> instead of <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0400</span>.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>
        instruction executed by the interrupt service routine must be
        either <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0777</span>
        to store the pre-interrupt value of the HOP Register at either
        address 0776 or 0777.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should then save any registers
        or common memory locations that were going to be altered into
        local storage.&nbsp; In almost all cases, one would suppose that
        the accumulator needed to be stored.&nbsp; If multiplications or
        divisions would be used, the P-Q Register would also need to be
        saved, presumably with a pair of instructions like <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLA 0775</span>
        followed by <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span></span>.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should do a <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span>
        from the Interrupt Storage input port to determine which of the
        12 interrupt sources are active, so that it can vector to an
        appropriate service routine for it.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should then do whatever
        computations it needed to do.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should restore the registers it
        had saved (<span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">CLA <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span></span>
        followed by <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0775</span> to restore the P-Q
        Register, if necessary, followed by a restoration of the
        accumulator).</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should do a <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span>
        to the Interrupt Register Reset output port, with just the
        specific bit set corresponding to the interrupt type being
        processed, to reenable that specific interrupt.&nbsp; The
        particular flavor of <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span> performed should, of
        course, take the Data Source from memory rather than from the
        accumulator, since at this point the accumulator has already
        been restored to its pre-interrupt condition.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The return from interrupt is either <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0777</span>,
        depending on which location the HOP constant had been stored on
        entry to the interrupt service routine.</li>
    </ol>
    Interrupts can be programmatically masked or unmasked with <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span> to
    Interrupt Inhibit.&nbsp; By setting a bit in Interrupt Inhibit
    corresponding to the interrupt whose masking is desired, that
    interrupt is thereby masked.&nbsp; Any combination of bits can be
    set, so any combination of interrupts can be masked.&nbsp; To
    reenable the interrupt, a 0 is written to the corresponding bit in
    Interrupt Inhibit.<br>
    <br>
    The available interrupts, and their bitwise positioning in the i/o
    registers mentioned above, differed for the Saturn IB rocket (Apollo
    7, ASTP, Skylab) vs. the Saturn V rocket (Apollo 8-17).&nbsp; The
    Saturn IB and Saturn V descriptions below were taken from different
    documents (namely, <a
      href="Documents/MSFC-MAN-206-SkylabSaturnIBFlightManual.pdf"> <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Skylab Saturn IB Flight Manual</span></a>
    p. 6-21 and <a style="font-style: italic;"
      href="Documents/MSFC-MAN-503-SaturnFlightManual-SA503.pdf"> Saturn
      Flight Manual, SA-503</a> p. 7-21, respectively), and if one
    accounts for the differences in language between the two documents,
    the interrupts are almost entirely the same. I've marked the ones in
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">red</span> that seem different
    to me, as well as any other points of particular difficulty for me.<br>

      Interrupts of the first 15 types are generated by the circuitry of

        through 017 of module 0 sector 017), depending on the source of
        the interrupt, thus transferring control to an interrupt-service
        routine appropriate to the interrupt source.&nbsp; Recall that
        this does not jump <i>to</i> address 0400, rather it loads the
        HOP Register from the value stored at address 0400, which has

        entry to the interrupt service routine.</li>
    </ol>
    In the PAST program specifically, space for the HOP constants of the
    first 15 interrupt vectors is allocated but no constant values are
    assigned at assembly time.&nbsp; The HOP constants are instead
    assigned dynamically later under program control as part of the
    self-testing process.&nbsp; On the other hand, the 16th vector
    (manual interrupt 16) is always processed at label <tt>L17P2</tt>
    in the source code.<br>

    <h3><a name="Telemetry" id="Telemetry"></a>Telemetry</h3>
    Output telemetry from the Instrumentation Unit transmitted to
    mission control can be sourced from either the LVDC or the
    LVDA.&nbsp; The LVDA spontaneously outputs telemetry on its own
    accord only when an error indication appears in its error-monitor
    register.&nbsp; The normal telemetry case, however, is that the LVDC
    initiates output telemetry by sending data to the LVDA via a <tt>PIO</tt>
    CPU instruction, and then the LVDA handles subsequent details of
    actually transmitting the data.&nbsp; In both cases, the output is
    in the form of 10-bit arrays, though the output packet logically
    consists of 4 such successive 10-bit arrays: i.e., of 40 bits.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    However, the specifics differ depend somewhat on the source.&nbsp;
    We'll confine our description to data sourced by the LVDC.&nbsp; As
    mentioned above, telemetering an output 40-bit packet from the
    LVDC's perspective is done by means of the CPU's <tt>PIO</tt>
    instruction, for which <a
      href="LVDC.html#IO_Ports_For_PIO_Instruction">a variety of i/o
      addresses are reserved for telemetry operations</a>.&nbsp; Of the
    40 bits:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>26 bits are the data payload.&nbsp; These bits come directly
        from the operand of the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction.</li>
      <li>9 bits are a tag indicating the specify type of data in the
        packet.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Bit A9: TBD</li>
        <li>Bit A8: 1.&nbsp; (1 for telemetry requested by the LVDC, and
          0 for the LVDA.)</li>
        <li>Bits A7-A1.&nbsp; These apparently come from the i/o address
          in the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the
          instructions <tt>CLA =67 / PIO 040</tt> would end up setting
          A7-A1 of the tag to 040 (octal), while the data payload would
          be set to 67 (decimal).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>3 bits determine the "mode".&nbsp; I'm not sure where these
        bits come from, but perhaps they come from the mode register,
        which the LVDC software sets via <tt>PIO 006</tt>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>1 bit indicates validity of the packet.&nbsp; The value of the
        bit is 0 if valid and 1 if invalid, and is present because the
        LVDC <tt>PIO</tt> operation can clobber an output already in
        progress, due to lack of synchronization between the LVDC and
        LVDA.&nbsp; At any rate, this bit is manipulated by the LVDA,
        and is transparent to the LVDC.<br>
      </li>
      <li>1 bit is parity.&nbsp; The overall parity of the 40-bit packet
        is odd.&nbsp; The parity bit is generated by the LVDA, and is
        transparent to the LVDC.</li>
    </ul>
    Different documentation differs in describing the arrangement of
    these various bits within the 40-bit packet, and does not fully
    explain the transmission order of the bits, so I'll refrain from
    discussing that topic here.<br>
    <br>
    A 40-bit packet requires 4.17 milliseconds to transmit, and thus the
    LVDC needs to space out its telemetry requests by at least this
    amount of time, or else subsequent telemetry request it outputs to
    the LVDA will overwrite and destroy prior requests.<br>
    <br>
    As far as the numerical specifics of the tag values used in the
    40-bit packets, this is TBD.<br>
    <h3><a name="Up-data"></a>Up-data</h3>
    <p>(A lot of information in this section is abstracted from the <a
        href="Documents/AstrionicsSystemsHandbook_Nov69.pdf">Astrionics
        System Handbook</a>, chapter 6, "Radio Command Systems".)<br>
    </p>
    <p>The term <i>up-data</i> refers to commands transmitted from
      mission control to the LVDC/LVDA.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As transmitted, the standard command-word format consists of 35
      bits:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 bits are referred to as the "X" bits.&nbsp; They form an
        address, indicating which vehicle the message is intended for. <br>
      </li>
      <li>14 bits are also an address, but they identify a specific
        "command decoder" for processing the message.&nbsp; A vehicle
        may have multiple command decoders with different hard-coded
        addresses.<br>
      </li>
      <li>18 bits comprise the control and data portions of the message.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The latter two sets of bits are interspersed within the message,
      and thus are not transmitted in the specific order shown above.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="upDataLVDC.png" width="923"
        height="501"></div>
    <p>However, the as-transmitted format of the data isn't really very
      relevant to how the LVDC and its software relate to the up-data,
      since only a portion of the transmitted bits reach the LVDC
      software — specifically only some of the bits from the final group
      of 18 — and even then they don't always reach the LVDC in the
      exact form they are transmitted.&nbsp; Thus, let's narrow our
      discussion of the up-data to just the LVDC's perspective.&nbsp;
      The 18 control&amp;data bits of the message are further
      categorized as:<br>
    </p>
    2 "OM/D" or&nbsp;<i>orbital mode/data</i> (OM/D) bits.&nbsp; (These
    are depicted in the image above, presumably mistakenly, as <b>D</b>M/D






































    bits.)&nbsp; The LVDA combines this pair of bits (in some manner
    unknown to me), and thus the LVDC receives a single OM/D bit.&nbsp;
    The LVDC recognizes two types of commands, <i>mode commands words</i>
    and <i>data command words</i>, and the type of the command word is
    determined by the OM/D bits. &nbsp; <br>
    <p>Similarly, there are two transmitted "interrupt bits" (see the
      image above).&nbsp; These cause an interrupt to occur in the LVDC,
      which I believe is designated in <a href="#Interrupts">the
        interrupt table given earlier as bit-position 4</a>, Command
      Receiver Interrupt.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the 14 remaining bits actually represent just 7 bits of
      actual information, since each bit appears both in its normal form
      and in its logically-complemented form for the purpose of
      error-detection. <br>
    </p>

        href="Documents/AstrionicsSystemsHandbook_Nov69.pdf">the
        Astrionics System Handbook</a> for more detail, but the LVDC
      software accesses the received command using the following general
      steps:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do unrelated processing until the Command Receiver interrupt
        occurs. </li>
      <li>Interrogate the OM/D bit of <tt>PIO 057</tt> to verify that
        its value is 1.&nbsp; This means that the received word is a
        "mode command word".&nbsp; (The first word of any sequence of
        commands will be a mode command word, followed by some number of
        "data command words".)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Interrogate <tt>PIO 043</tt> to get the value of the mode
        word, and parses it to determine the specific command that has
        been requested.&nbsp; Each command type will imply the number of
        data command words that will be subsequently transmitted and
        processed.&nbsp; For the sake of discussion, let's call that
        number <i>N</i>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Outputs telemetry (TBD) indicating successful reception of a
        command word.</li>
      <li>For each of the <i>N</i> data command words that are supposed
        to be received for this sequence, do the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Do unrelated processing until the Command Receiver interrupt
          occurs.</li>
        <li>Interrogate the OM/D bit of <tt>PIO 057</tt> to verify that
          its value is 0.&nbsp; I.e., that the received word is a data
          command word.</li>
        <li>Get the received word using <tt>PIO 043</tt>.</li>
        <li>Buffer the received word in memory.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After all of the <i>N</i> data words are received, perform
        whatever action is appropriate for the now-completely-received
        command.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The command word read using <tt>PIO 043</tt> has the format
      shown in the illustration to the right.&nbsp; As mentioned above,
      there are 7 actual data bits, but they appear twice each:&nbsp;
      Once "normally", and once inverted.&nbsp; Besides that, there is a
      "sequence bit" which also appears normally (bit 8) and inverted
      (bit 1).&nbsp; This bet helps to make sure the command words have
      been received in an appropriate order.&nbsp; The sequence bit is 0
      for the mode command word, then 1 for the first data command word
      (if any), and then it just toggles between 0 and 1 for each
      subsequent data command word received.&nbsp; When the next mode
      command word is received, the sequence bit goes back to 0 and the
      pattern repeats.<br>

Assembly


































































































      Language</h2>
    Unfortunately, there is no surviving manual or other reference
    describing the syntax of LVDC assembly language, nor the pseudo-ops
    available in it, nor any source code for the original LVDC
    assembler.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    This section is a compilation of my own inferences about those
    things from evaluating the available LVDC source code and from
    writing my own LVDC assembler, and then subsequently updating for
    PTC source code that was acquired later.&nbsp; The description is
    intended to be authoritative only in the sense that it describes how
    my own assembler (<a href="#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">yaASM.py</a>),











































    which does produce an assembled core-rope image identical to that of
    the original assembler, handles the code.&nbsp; However, my
    description shouldn't be taken as authoritative in any larger
    sense.&nbsp; For example, when I say below that the assembler has an
    initial "preprocessor pass" that performs certain processing, I mean
    that yaASM.py has such a pass; I <i>imagine</i> that the original
    assembler did as well, but cannot guarantee it.<br>
    <br>
    You'll probably need to refer to the previous <a
      href="#CPU_Instructions">discussion of the CPU instructions</a>
    from time to time, in order to follow the discussion.<br>
    <h3><a name="Basic_Factoids"></a> Basic Factoids</h3>
    <i>Empty lines</i>:&nbsp; Are ignored by the assembler.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Code comments (original Project Apollo)</i>:&nbsp; Full-line
    comments seem to be prefixed by the character '*' in column 1.&nbsp;
    Anything left over at the end of a line after the beginning of a
    line has been correctly parsed seems to be treated as a comment, and
    doesn't require any '*' prefix.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Code comments (modern Virtual AGC Project)</i>:&nbsp; Comments <i>I've</i>
    added that were not present in the original listing are all
    full-line comments but with a '#' character in column 1.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Character set</i>:&nbsp; Upper-case alphabetic, numeric, and some
    punctuation.&nbsp; This isn't really any great surprise, of course,
    if you reflect that all of the source code was supplied on computer
    punch cards to the IBM/360 mainframe computer which ran the
    assembler program, and that the character sets supported by keypunch
    machines did not include lower-case characters anyway.&nbsp; Douglas
    Jones has written a fun <a
      href="http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/%7Ejones/cards/index.html">exploration






















































































      of punch cards</a>, if you're interested in that kind of
    thing.&nbsp; (By the way, I've heard anecdotally that the executable
    program which was output by the assembly of the LVDC software was
    punched into a long mylar tape, perhaps 1.5" wide, which was then
    transported by the coders themselves to Marshall Space Flight
    Center, where the mylar tape was put into a tape reader which
    transferred the program into the ferrite-core memory of the LVDC
    itself.&nbsp; This was possible because, as you may recall from
    above, all of the ferrite cores in the LVDC were both readable <i>and</i>
    writable.&nbsp; This contrasts to the AGC, in which the program was
    stored in read-only memory which had to be <i>manufactured</i>
    rather than simply written to.&nbsp; So installing the software in
    the LVDC was a far less painful, less expensive, much quicker
    process than installing software in the AGC.&nbsp; In the case of
    the AS-206RAM program listing, the assembler helpfully reports that
    the punch tape is 432 feet long.)<br>
    <br>
    <i>Symbols</i> (names of variables, constants, subroutines,
    ...):&nbsp; 6 characters or less, alphanumeric, with the leading
    character alphabetic.&nbsp; They may also contain the character ".",
    though not in the leading position.<br>
    <i><br>
      Literal numerical constants</i>:&nbsp; Decimal literals are as you
    might expect from working with AGC code.&nbsp; They are just regular
    decimal numbers, possibly with a suffixed exponent "<tt>E</tt><tt><i>n</i></tt>"
    for powers of 10, or a suffixed "<tt>B<i>n</i></tt>" for binary
    scaling, or both.&nbsp; Suffixed exponents and scales, if both are
    present, can be in either order.<br>
    <br>
    As far as octal literals are concerned, some contexts (such as the <tt>OCT</tt>
    pseudo-op or the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction) specifically require
    them, in which case there's no special syntax to distinguish them
    from decimal numbers, other than the fact that they're not
    associated with the digits '8' or '9', with decimal points, nor with
    exponents.&nbsp; In some usages there is ambiguity, which case the
    octal literal is prefixed by 'O' (upper-case alphabetical character,
    <i>not</i> a zero).<br>
    <br>
    Regarding conversion of literal numerical constants to bit patterns
    actually stored within 26-bit memory words, there seem to be three
    basic patterns:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Pure octal constants are <i>left</i>-aligned in their memory
        word.&nbsp; In other words, a constant of <i>N</i> octal digits
        would be right-padded by 26-<i>3N</i> bits of 0.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Pure decimal (integer) constants are fully <i>right</i>-aligned.&nbsp;










































        In other words, a decimal integer encoded as <i>N</i> bits
        would be sign-extended on the left by 26-<i>N</i> bits.</li>
      <li>Decimal non-integer constants are treated as being in the
        range -1.0 &lt; <i>constant</i> &lt; 1.0.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i><a name="AngleUnits"></a>Units of angular measurement</i>:&nbsp;








































      For most internal purposes, the source code typically measures
      angles in a unit called a <i>pirad</i>.&nbsp; I can find no
      reference to any unit by this name outside of the LVDC source
      code, nor does the LVDC source code choose to define it in the
      program comments.&nbsp; However, from the usage, it seems pretty
      clear that<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>1 pirad = 180° = <font face="Times New Roman, Times,
        serif">π</font> radians<br>
    </blockquote>
    And then there are <i>ladder units</i>.&nbsp; They are undefined,
    of course, but I suspect this is the form required for outputting
    angular commands to external hardware:<br>
    <blockquote>1° = 1/0.06 ladder units<br>
    </blockquote>
    There are also references to angles measured in <i>2016 fine units</i>,
    again undefined.&nbsp; Apparently, the "fine" refers to "fine
    resolvers", and thus is likely the form in which the angular data is
    delivered to the LVDC from the resolvers.&nbsp; At any rate, it
    appears that<br>
    <blockquote>1° = 2016/5.625 fine units<br>
    </blockquote>
    Finally, there are references to <i>backup units</i>, which are
    (you guessed it!) undefined.&nbsp; It appears that<br>
    <blockquote>1° = 2016/180 backup units<br>
    </blockquote>
    <i>Units of time</i>:&nbsp; The source code sometimes refers to a
    unit of time measurement it calls <i>qms</i>, but does not
    define.&nbsp; I suspect this is the unit of measurement in which the
    real-time clock delivers data to the LVDC.&nbsp; Apparently,<br>
    <blockquote>1 ms = 1/0.24609375 qms<br>
      1 ms ≈&nbsp; 4.063492 qms<br>
    </blockquote>
    In other words, "qms" probably stands for "quarter millisecond".<br>

        came directly from the original punch cards.&nbsp; As a
        convention, the sequence numbers are unique, and are in
        increasing order from one line to the next ... almost always,
        the sequence numbers increment by 10 from one line to the
        next.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are chunks of code having no
        sequence numbers at all.&nbsp; When that happens, the assembler
        simply adds 10 to the last sequence number it saw, and then
        assigns that same number to all subsequent lines until
        encountering a card with an actual sequence number on it.&nbsp;
        (I'm <i>not</i> saying it increments the sequence number by 10
        on every unnumbered line; it increments it just once, and then
        keeps giving line after line the <i>same</i> number.)&nbsp;
        Given that fact, it's pretty obvious that the cards were
        processed in the order they were encountered, rather than being
        rearranged internally to the assembler in sequence-number
        order.&nbsp; I don't believe the original assembler needed to
        use these sequence numbers other than for reference purposes in
        the symbol table (see below).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By the way, these observations about columnar alignment don't
      relate to the new assembler (yaASM.py), which does not generally
      enforce or use the columnar alignment in any way, other than to
      recognize that column 1 is special.&nbsp; (Exception: The <tt>BCI</tt>
      pseudo-op used in PTC source code is special and <i>does</i>
      require column alignment.)&nbsp; I don't know if the original
      assembler actually cared about the columnar alignment, or whether
      the alignment I've observed is simply a convention.<br>
    </p>

    <h3><a name="Preprocessor_Pass"></a>Preprocessor Pass</h3>
    <p>The LVDC assembler is a macro assembler, meaning that the
      language it processes has a variety of constructs intended to make
      coding easier and more manageable but which aren't directly
      related to the internal characteristics of the LVDC CPU.&nbsp;
      These constructs are all resolved and removed from the code by a
      dedicated preprocessor pass prior to any assembly of actual LVDC
      instructions or allocation of LVDC memory.&nbsp; The various
      preprocessor constructs that appear in LVDC code are described in
      this section.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The preprocessor itself operates in a single pass, and therefore
      any symbols or macros it uses must have been defined prior in the
      source code to such use.&nbsp; I don't think that any of the
      features mentioned in this section are used the PTC source code
      available to us, so it's possible that the early versions of the
      assembler used for PTC didn't have a preprocessor at all.<br>
    </p>
    <i>The </i><i><tt>CALL</tt></i><i> macro</i>:&nbsp; <tt>CALL</tt>
    is a macro hard-coded into the assembler itself.&nbsp; By a "macro",
    I mean that superficially it is used in source code as if it were a
    CPU instruction, but it is not a CPU instruction.&nbsp; Rather, it
    is a shorthand for a sequence of several CPU instructions.&nbsp; A
    single <tt>CALL</tt> is expanded by the preprocessor into the
    appropriate stream of true CPU instructions.&nbsp; When I say it is
    "hard-coded" into the assembler, I mean that the language also
    includes ways for the programmer to define his own custom macros
    within the LVDC program if he wants, but that there are no such
    definitions for the <tt>CALL</tt> macro in the LVDC source code.<br>
    <br>
    It is probably hard-coded in the assembler rather than having a soft
    definition within the source code because there are two distinct
    variations of it.:&nbsp; There are both 2-argument and 2-argument
    variants of the macro.&nbsp; The 2-argument version is used for
    calling a subroutine having a single input argument.&nbsp; The macro
    is invoked by a source-code line of the form<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CALL <i>ARG1</i>,<i>ARG2</i></tt> <br>
    </blockquote>
    which the preprocessor replaces by a pair of actual instructions, <br>
    <blockquote><tt>CLA <i>ARG2</i></tt><br>
      <tt>HOP <i>ARG1<br>
        </i></tt></blockquote>
    All three lines appear in assembly listings, but the <tt>CALL</tt>
    is treated as a comment and the other two have a '+' character
    printed next to them to show that they're there due to the expansion
    of the macro. <br>
    <br>
    The 3-argument version,<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CALL <i>ARG1,ARG2,ARG3</i></tt> <br>
    </blockquote>
    instead expands as<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CLA ARG3<br>
        STO 775<br>
        CLA ARG2<br>
        HOP ARG1<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    and thus calls a subroutine with two input arguments.<br>
    <br>
    <i>General macro-definition facility</i>:&nbsp; As I said above, the
    macro facility is general-purpose, and custom macros can also be
    defined within the source code.&nbsp; The syntax used for defining a
    macro is as follows:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><i>NAME</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        MACRO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARG1,ARG2,...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... code using the symbols
        ARG1, ARG2, and so on ...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMAC<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    Once defined, <i><tt>NAME</tt></i> can be used to invoke the
    associated macro.<br>
    <br>
    Note that in the <i>definition</i> of the macro, the strings <tt>ARG1</tt>,
    <tt>ARG2</tt>, and so on are literal.&nbsp; You can't <i>define</i>
    a macro with arbitrary arguments names like (say) <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>,
    and <tt>z</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    As an example, consider the 2-argument the <tt> CALL</tt> macro
    described earlier.&nbsp; It is hard-coded into the assembler, and
    therefore doesn't require a definition in the code, but if it
    weren't hard-coded it could have been giving the following soft
    definition:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>CALL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MACRO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        ARG1,ARG2<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp; ARG2<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARG1<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMAC<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <i>Pseudo variables</i>:&nbsp; "Pseudo variables" are named numeric
    constants known only by the preprocessor.&nbsp; Any usages of such
    pseudo variables are replaced by numeric literals by the
    preprocessor, and thus none of them remain in the code by the time
    the actual assembly process begins.&nbsp; This implies that the
    namespace for pseudo variables is distinct from that for left-hand
    symbols in general, so a pseudo variable can have the same name as a
    block of code or a data variable in memory without overlap.<br>
    <br>
    Pseudo variables are <i>defined</i> by the EQU pseudo-op, with a
    syntax like the following:<br>
    <blockquote><tt><i>NAME</i></tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (</tt><tt><i>EXPRESSION</i></tt><tt>)</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    In the operand here, the parentheses are literal and must always be
    present.&nbsp; <tt><i>EXPRESSION</i></tt> is an arithmetical
    expression involving numeric literals, the operations + - * /,
    parentheses, and other (previously-defined) pseudo variables.&nbsp;
    For example,<br>
    <blockquote><tt>OMEGA&nbsp;&nbsp; EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (.72921141E-4)</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>RWCP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (OMEGA*6373377*.87993)</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    In general, parenthesized expressions involving pseudo-variables
    like this can appear anywhere in LVDC source code, and is replaced
    by the preprocessor with the numeric literals.&nbsp; Except for
    appearing as left-hand symbols in <tt>EQU</tt> statements, pseudo
    variables appear <i>only</i> with such parenthesized expressions,
    or in tests for conditional assembly (see below).<br>
    <br>
    In most usages, an <tt>(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)</tt> appearing in an
    assembly language operand can be suffixed with an optional binary
    scaling factor<br>
    <blockquote><tt>(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)B<i>n</i></tt></blockquote>
    The optional scaling factor doesn't really make sense if it were
    used in the <tt>EQU</tt> statements defining the pseudo-variables,
    since the purpose of the scaling factor is really a relationship
    between the logical value of the number and the physically-pragmatic
    pattern of bits stored in memory.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the assembler
    allows any expression to be thusly suffixed by a scaling factor,
    even in the <tt>EQU</tt> statement itself. <br>
    <i></i><i><br>
      Conditional assembly</i>:&nbsp; Code can be conditionally retained
    or discarded by the preprocessor the basis of a test, with the
    syntax<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>IF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>PSEUDOVARIABLE</i><i></i>=(<i>EXPRESSION</i>)<br>
          ... code ...<br>
          ENDIF<br>
        </tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    If the value of the specified pseudo variable is equal the evaluated
    expression, then enclosed code is retained by the preprocessor, and
    is thus eventually assembled.&nbsp; If not, then the enclosed code
    is discarded.<br>
    <h3><a name="Assembly_Pass"></a>Assembly Pass</h3>
    <p>(Technically, what I'm calling the "assembly pass" here is really
      implemented in the new assembler, yaASM.py, in two successive
      passes, known the "discovery pass" and the "assembly pass".&nbsp;
      The former associates all program labels and variable names with
      physical addresses, while the latter performs the actual assembly
      using the now-resolved addresses.&nbsp; That detail is totally
      irrelevant and transparent to the user, but would be necessary
      information to anybody modifying yaASM.py itself.)<br>
    </p>
    <i></i>
    <p><i>Instruction operands</i>:&nbsp; Operand formats differ for
      some CPU instruction types, but most of them require a variable (a
      word in data memory), and conform to a pattern in which there are
      several allowed variants for specifying the operand:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A literal 3-digit octal number (such as 777 or 776), which is
        an offset into the DM/DS (Data Module / Data Sector) defined by
        the current contents of the HOP register.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The symbolic name of a variable or constant defined elsewhere
        in the program.&nbsp; The variable/constant has to be in the
        current DM/DS, so if the referenced symbol doesn't happen to be
        located in that particular module or sector, it could be a
        problem.</li>
      <li>An arithmetical expression involving symbolic names, such as <tt>CBTAB+1</tt>
        or <tt>CBTAB+(4*CBSTNO+1)</tt>.&nbsp; For a sufficiently
        complex expression, since as the latter one in the preceding
        sentence, the raw form of the instruction will appear in the
        assembly listing as if it were a comment (like a <tt>CALL</tt>
        line), and the fully resolved expression will appear marked with
        a "+" character as if it were a macro expansion ... which it
        probably is.&nbsp; For example, if <tt>(4*CBSTNO+1)</tt>
        resolves to 57, then the expanded instruction would be <tt>CBTAB+57</tt>.&nbsp;



































































        Note that such expressions, depending on what they contain, may
        resolve <i>either</i> to an address in memory, or else to a
        constant value.&nbsp; In the latter case, the numerical constant
        is treated like the constants described in the following item.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The character <tt>=</tt>, prefixed to a literal numerical
        constant.&nbsp; Here the assembler allocates an <i>unnamed</i>
        variable in the current DM/DS, stores the value of the constant
        at that variable, and then uses the location of the new-created
        variable as the operand.&nbsp; In other words, not all program
        variables are explicitly defined by pseudo-ops ... some of them
        are transparently allocated in as needed by the assembler itself
        in memory locations not previously used for anything..&nbsp;
        Each numerically-unique constant is stored only once as a
        variable and is reused everywhere that requires it.&nbsp; For
        example, in the AS-206RAM LVDC assembly listing, <tt>=1B18</tt>
        is an operand in the lines with sequence numbers 051570 and
        051910, while <tt>=00000004</tt> is used at 051950 and 053380,
        but they both evaluate to the same numerical value and thus
        reference the same memory location (2-06-076).&nbsp; Note that
        if the literal numerical constant begins with the character 'O'
        (alphabetic, not digit) then the number is octal, while if the
        leading 'O' is not present then the number is decimal.</li>
      <li>For PTC <i>only</i>:&nbsp; The PTC version of the assembler
        had an extraordinarily dangerous "feature", which thankfully had
        been removed by the time of the LVDC version of the
        assembler.&nbsp; If an operand was encountered which would
        ordinarily be the name of a variable, but for which no actual
        variable with that name was explicitly allocated in the source
        code, then the assembler would <i>automatically</i> <i>silently</i>
        allocate one in unused memory, in the same manner as for
        operands like <tt>=O<i>octal</i></tt> <i>constants</i>
        described in the item above.&nbsp; What makes this dangerous is
        the possibility of a typo in a variable name at one place in a
        program but not in other places.&nbsp; For example, if you had
        the following code, you'd think the <tt>CLA</tt> was accessing
        <tt>ARGX12</tt> (with the value 12345 octal), when in reality a
        new variable <tt>ARCX12</tt> (with the value 0) had been
        created, and the <tt>CLA</tt> would be accessing that instead.
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><tt>ARGX12&nbsp; OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12345<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARCX12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MISTYPED "ARGX12" AS "ARCX12"<br>
          </tt></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <p>Except for the <tt>HOP</tt><tt></tt> instructions, the other CPU
      instructions that transfer program control target a location in
      the current IM/IS rather than a variable in the DM/DS, and thus
      require a different type of operand. Those instructions (<tt>TRA</tt>,
      <tt>TNZ</tt>, <tt>TMI</tt>) thus have operands in one of the
      following two formats:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The symbolic name of a code location in the current IM/IS.</li>
      <li>"<tt>*+<i>n</i></tt>" or "<tt>*-<i>n</i></tt>", where <tt><i>n</i></tt>
        is a literal decimal constant.&nbsp; This references the memory
        location <tt><i>n</i></tt> words later or earlier than the
        current instruction, respectively.&nbsp; (I say that the literal
        constant is <i>decimal</i> because yaASM.py implements it in
        that way.&nbsp; However, there are no instances of <tt><i>n</i></tt>&gt;7











































        in the existing LVDC source code, so I really have no way of
        knowing whether the original assembler accepted decimal
        constants or octal ones.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Other exceptions:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The shift instruction, <tt>SHF</tt>, and the shorthand
        replacements for it, <tt>SHR</tt> and <tt>SHL</tt>.&nbsp; The
        latter two shorthand instructions take an operand of 0 or a
        positive decimal integer, and thus represent logical right or
        left shifts by a selectable number of positions.&nbsp; With "<tt>0</tt>"
        as the operand, as a special case, the accumulator is
        cleared.&nbsp; There are no uses of <tt>SHF</tt> in the
        existing source code, so while it must take an integer operand,
        I'm not sure whether it would be octal or decimal or something
        else.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; <tt>SHR</tt> and <tt>SHL</tt>
        are implemented as <tt>SHF</tt> operations, but <tt>SHF</tt>
        can only shift by 1 or 2 positions for LVDC, or 1 through 6
        positions for PTC.&nbsp; Therefore, if the operand for <tt>SHR</tt>
        or <tt>SHL</tt> is greater than 2 (6), the assembler
        transparently converts the operation to a minimum-length
        sequence of shorter shift operations.&nbsp; For example, for
        LVDC a <tt>SHL 5</tt> assembles to <tt>SHL 2</tt> / <tt>SHL 2</tt>
        / <tt>SHL 1</tt>.&nbsp; Consequently, depending on the operand,
        any given <tt>SHR</tt> or <tt>SHL</tt> may assemble to
        multiple executable words in memory rather than to a single
        word. </li>
      <li>The <tt>CDS</tt> instruction requires an operand of the form
        <tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS</i>,<i>DUPDN</i></tt> where the three octal
        fields are interpreted, respectively, as specifying a
        HOP-constant-like data module (0-7), data sector (0-17), and
        duplex vs simplex mode (0-1).&nbsp; The <tt>DEQD</tt> pseudo-op
        (see below) can be used to create symbolic macro names for such
        specifications, and so the operand for <tt>CDS</tt> can be such
        a symbolic macro name as well.</li>
      <li>The <tt>EXM</tt> instruction has operands of the form "<tt><i>target</i>,<i>syllable</i>,<i>modifier</i></tt>",
























































































        where <tt><i>target</i></tt>, <tt><i>syllable</i></tt>, and <tt><i>modifier</i></tt>
        are all small literal octal integer constants.&nbsp; These
        fields may be interpreted as follows:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt><i>target</i></tt> (0-3):&nbsp; Specifies offset in
          residual memory of target instruction:&nbsp; 0 for 600, 1 for
          640, 2 for 700, 3 for 740. (I.e., 200, 240, 300, or 340 in the
          residual memory sector.)<br>
        </li>
        <li><tt><i>syllable</i></tt> (0-1):&nbsp; Specifies syllable of
          the target instruction within the target word.<br>
        </li>
        <li><tt><i>modifier</i></tt> (0-17 octal):&nbsp; Specifies a
          4-bit modifier for the instruction:&nbsp; the two
          least-significant bits <i>replace</i> the corresponding bits
          in the target instruction, while the two most-significant bits
          <i>bitwise-OR</i> with the corresponding bits.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>The <tt>PIO</tt> and <tt>CIO</tt> instructions accept only
        literal octal constants (000-377 for <tt>PIO</tt>, 000-777 for
        <tt>CIO</tt>).&nbsp; All of the examples I saw in the original
        LVDC/PTC assembly listings were 0-padded, though yaASM.py does
        not enforce that restriction.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <i><a name="Pseudo-ops"></a></i>Pseudo-ops</h3>
    The following table shows every type of pseudo-op I've encountered
    in the AS-206RAM and PTC ADAPT Self-Test program listings, and what
    I've been able to infer about them:<br>
    <br>

          <td valign="top">This pseudo-op appears only in PTC code.<br>
            <br>
            This pseudo-op encodes the <i><tt>text</tt></i> argument
            into consecutive memory locations.&nbsp; The <i><tt>text</tt></i>
            operand is delimited by a leading '^' and trailing '$',
            which are not themselves encoded into memory.&nbsp; The
            assembler right-pads the <i><tt>text</tt></i>, if
            necessary, until it is a multiple of 4 characters ending in
            at least 2 spaces. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note</b>:&nbsp; The leading carat character (<tt>^</tt>)
            in <tt><i>text</i></tt> was not used in the original
            Apollo-era source code.&nbsp; It has been added to the
            assembly-language syntax for the convenience of the <i>modern</i>
            assembler (yaASM.py).&nbsp; That's because the <tt><i>text</i></tt>
            argument sometimes begins with a space character, and since
            the modern assembler does not enforce strict columnar
            alignment of the operand, it would otherwise have no way to
            ascertain where <tt><i>text</i></tt> begins.&nbsp; The
            original assembler, on the other hand, did enforce strict
            columnar alignment, and therefore required no delimiter at
            the beginning.<br>
            <br>
            Encoding of the <i><tt>text</tt></i> strings involves both

            <p>In case it isn't obvious from the table above, code 00 is
              a blank space.&nbsp; The yellow-shaded characters have
              encodings in the PAST program octal listing that don't
              match the BA8421 encoding from wikipedia for some reason,
              so the table above has been doctored to match the
              assembler.&nbsp; The gray-background codes are
              non-printable.&nbsp; I googled some of weirder characters,
              since it wasn't obvious why they would be included in such
              a limited repertoire of symbols, and unexpectedly got some
              historical information about them that may actually be
              applicable to their usage in the PTC: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Code 77, the "group mark" character (a vertical line
                with three horizontal hashes) was "formerly used as a
                separator character for i/o operations".</li>
              <li>Code 74, the "square lozenge" character (a square with
                concave sides) was "used as a command delimiter in some
                very old computers".</li>
              <li>Code 32, the "double dagger" character (a vertical
                line with two horizontal hashes) is possibly used as an
                error indicator.</li>
            </ul>
            I think that the set of allowed characters for <tt><i>text</i></tt>
            is the intersection of the printable characters from the
            BA8421 set listed above and the EBCDIC character set.&nbsp;
            Unless I'm mistaken, that's just:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Digits:&nbsp; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br>
              </li>
              <li>Upper case alphabetic:&nbsp; A B C D E F G H I J K L M
                N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</li>
              <li>A blank space<br>
              </li>
              <li>Other:&nbsp; / . , - + * ( ).<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The reason for this restriction is that the input
            assembly-language source files and the printed assembly
            listing are encoded in EBCDIC while the encoding of the
            output assembled octals for the <tt>BCI</tt> pseudo-op uses
            the BA8421 coding scheme.&nbsp; Therefore, only characters
            available simultaneously in both characters are meaningful
            from input through output of the assembler..<br>
            <br>
            As far as the octals assembled for <tt>BCI</tt> are
            concerned, each of the memory locations allocated by the
            pseudo-op encodes exactly 4 characters of the message.&nbsp;
            The first character of the string occupies the two
            most-significant octal digits of the first memory location,
            the next character occupies the next lower two octal digits
            of that memory location, and so on. Thus, encoding 4
            characters requires 24 bits per 26-bit memory word.&nbsp;
            The least-significant bits of each memory word are always
            unused and are 0. <br>
            <br>
            For example, when the following is assembled,<br>
            <blockquote>&nbsp;<tt>BCI&nbsp;&nbsp; ^TYPE OCTAL
                CHARACTERS$</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            the assembler notes that "<tt>TYPE...</tt>" has the BA8421
            character octal character codes 23, 30, 47, 65, ..., and
            thus the assembled octal encoding of the string is
            233047650, ....&nbsp; That's pretty straightforward.<br>
            <br>
            In the <i>printed</i> assembly listing output, though,
            things are much less straightforward.&nbsp; While the
            original assembler did print out a representation of how the
            <tt><i>text</i></tt> string assembled, presumably intended
            to be helpful to the programmer, what it ended up printing
            was a pretty goofy representation of the original
            text.&nbsp; For example, consider the example <tt>BCI</tt>
            usage mentioned above, which comes from page 3 of the PAST
            program.&nbsp; The assembly listing displays the assembled
            memory locations as<br>
            <blockquote><tt>CHPV</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>0OTC</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>/L0T</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>Y/R/</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>TCVR</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>B000</tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            As nearly as I can guess, the assembler derived this
            nonsensical representation roughly by the following
            procedure:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Get the BA8421 encoding of a character from the <tt><i>text</i></tt>
                operand.&nbsp; For example, octal 23 for 'T'. </li>
              <li>Add this to octal 260 (hex B0).&nbsp; For the 'T' this
                would give 23+260=303.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Interpret this latter value as the <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC#Code_page_layout">EBCDIC</a>
                code for a character and print it.&nbsp; For example, in
                EBCDIC, octal 303 (hex C3) is 'C', and that's why 'C'
                ends up being printed out in place of 'T'.<br>
              </li>
              <li>For <i>some</i> characters in <tt><i>text</i></tt>,
                this procedure can produce an encoded value that doesn't
                represent any character in EBCDIC, and which therefore
                can't be printed as-is.&nbsp; In that case, the
                procedure seems to be to hunt around by
                adding/subtracting multiples of octal 100 (0x40) to the
                EBCDIC code until a printable character is
                obtained.&nbsp; Here's how that works out in detail in a
                few examples:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Space character:&nbsp; ' ' → 0<sub>8</sub> (BA8421)
                  → 0xB0 (EBCDIC) → undefined.&nbsp; The only printable
                  EBCDIC character that can be reached from 0xB0 by
                  adding or subtracting multiples of 0x40 is 0xB0+0x40 =
                  0xF0 (EBCDIC) → '0'.</li>
                <li>'A' → 61<sub>8</sub> (BA8421) → 0xE1 (EBCDIC) →
                  undefined.&nbsp; The only reachable printable EBCDIC
                  character is 0xE1-0x80=0x61 → '/'.</li>
                <li>',' → 33<sub>8</sub> (BA8421) → 0xCB (EBCDIC) →
                  undefined.&nbsp; The only reachable printable EBCDIC
                  character is 0xCB-0x80=04B → '.'.</li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
            <p>Yes, it seems silly to <i>me</i> too.&nbsp; Don't blame
              me.&nbsp; Perhaps there's some amazing rationale for this
              seemingly-loopy procedure that I simply don't
              understand.&nbsp; If you know of one, let me know.&nbsp; I
              suspect it's just a bug, but it seems ridiculous that a
              bug as ridiculous as printing out "CHPV..." in place of
              "TYPE..." went unnoticed back in the day!&nbsp; The modern
              assembler (yaAGC.py) by default <i>does not</i> reproduce
              this behavior, but does so if the --past-bugs command-line
              switch is used.<br>

            <br>
            Naively, what this pseudo-op does is to assembles two
            instructions (remember, each instruction assembles into one
            "syllable" and that two syllables comprise a single word of
            memory), allocate a word of memory, and store the assembled
            pair of instructions in it.&nbsp; However, because of the
            way <tt>EXM</tt> uses such assembled instructions, there
            are a few details which differ from this simple model.&nbsp;
            Specifically, the residual bit (A9) and least-significant
            bits (A2, A1) in <tt><i>operand1</i></tt> and <i><tt>operand2</tt></i>
            are modified from what you expect to include certain bits
            from the DS (data sector) applicable to <tt><i>operand1</i></tt>
            and <i><tt>operand2</tt></i>.&nbsp; The documentation for <tt>EXM</tt>
            should make it clear what those changes are. </td>

            specification of the offset into the data-memory sector,
            since if the assembler finds that the requested <tt><i>DLOC</i></tt>

            The first of these lines defines a macro, <tt>MYPAT</tt>,
            which can pack 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, and 6-bit fields
            into a single 20-bit field.&nbsp; Since the LVDC word-size
            is actually 26 bits, the unused 6 bits of the compiled
            constant will all be 0.&nbsp; Confusingly, the way the
            assembler <i>displays</i> word-size constants, the
            least-significant bit is always 0 (because it's the physical
            position in which parity is stored), so the constant is
            actually aligned at bit 27 and appears as exactly 9 octal
            digits.&nbsp; Because of this, in other words, it will
            really appear that there are 7 unused bits assigned the
            value 0.<br>
            <br>

            compiles such a constant and stores it at a the memory
            location <tt>MYCON</tt>.&nbsp; The 2-bit field will have
            the (binary) value 01, the 3-bit field will have the value
            010, and so on, so the actual value of <tt>MYCON</tt>, in

            fields for instruction memory (<i><tt>LOC</tt></i>) and data
            memory (<tt><i>DLOC</i></tt>).<br>
            <br>
            The trailing <tt><i>DLOC</i></tt> is sometimes not

            In that case, the first previously-unused location in the
            select data module/sector is used.&nbsp; Actually, even
            specifying <tt><i>DLOC</i></tt> explicitly does not
            necessarily imply that the data location is set to <i><tt>DLOC</tt></i>,
            since if that location has already been used, the next
            unused location after that will be selected instead, and the

            <br>
            Any of the fields may be left empty.&nbsp; As far as I can
            tell, any field left empty defaults to 0, except for <tt><tt><i>DLOC</i></tt></tt>.&nbsp;









            In the case of <tt><tt><i>DLOC</i></tt></tt>, it appears to
            me that it defaults to the <i>next</i> location after the
            previous one allocated in the sector.&nbsp; For example,
            consider the following example code:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,2,0,3,0,16,20</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1234</tt><tt><br>

                ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... to some other memory sector

                ...<br>

              </tt><tt>OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4567</tt><tt> </tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            The first 3 <tt>OCT</tt>s would be at addresses 0-16-20,
            0-16-21, and 0-16-22.&nbsp; The final <tt>OCT</tt> would be
            address 0-16-23.&nbsp; It should not be inferred that the
            addresses 0-16-0 through 0-16-17 are completely filled up
            (as they would be for a similar LVDC pseudo-op <tt>ORGDD</tt>),









            because <tt>ORG</tt> merely increments the preceding
            address (rather than searching for the first unallocated
            address as in the LVDC's <tt>ORGDD</tt>).&nbsp; In fact, it
            appears to me that <tt>ORG</tt> with <tt>DLOC</tt> left
            empty never goes to <tt>DLOC</tt>=0, and instead starts
            with <tt>DLOC</tt>=1. <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, it appears to me that the original assembler had a
            bug, which we intentionally reproduce in the modern
            assembler (yaASM.py).&nbsp; The bug is that even if no data
            words had been allocated between one ORG and the next, the
            assembler still assumed that a <i>minimum</i> of 1 word had
            been allocated anyway.&nbsp; Suppose, for example, we were
            to append the following code to the sample above:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,2,0,3,0,16,</tt><br>
              <tt> </tt><tt><tt>ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,2,0,3,0,16,</tt><br>
                <tt> </tt></tt><tt><tt>ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  1,2,0,3,0,16,</tt><br>
                <tt> </tt>OCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5670</tt><tt> </tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            The <tt>OCT</tt> would be at address 0-16-26, because each
            of the final 2 <tt>ORG</tt>s would incorrectly have assumed
            that at least one word had been allocated prior to it. <br>

          <td valign="middle">These pseudo-ops alter the way the
            assembler places and orders succeeding items in
            memory.&nbsp; The usual positioning and ordering is
            represented by <tt>USE INST</tt>, whereas I'm unsure of
            what <tt>USE DAT</tt> is for.&nbsp; I think it may be a
            convenient way to pack CPU instructions when one wants to
            place them in the midst of an area of memory used primarily
            for storing variables, or may represent an alternative to
            the <tt>DFW</tt> pseudo-op (see above).<br>
            <br>
            <tt>USE INST</tt>:<br>
            <blockquote>The <tt>ORGDD</tt> pseudo-op (see above)
              defines an origin for both "instructions" (fields <tt><i>IM</i>,<i>IS</i>,<i>S</i>,<i>LOC</i></tt>)
              and "data" (fields <tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS,LOC2</i></tt>).&nbsp;






















































              Normally, instructions are assembled at successive offset
              locations while the "syllable" (0 or 1) is kept
              fixed.&nbsp; I.e., normally, all of the locations with
              syllable 0 are used up, then all of the locations with
              syllable 1.&nbsp; The assembler uses the <tt><i>IM</i>,<i>IS</i>,<i>S</i>,<i>LOC</i></tt>
              fields from <tt>ORGDD</tt> to determine the memory area
              in which this happens.&nbsp; When the end of the memory
              sector is reached, a different syllable or sector or
              module must be selected either by the assembler or the
              coder.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Data is similarly assembled at successive locations (with
              pseudo-ops like <tt>DEC</tt>, <tt>OCT</tt>, or <tt>BSS</tt>),






















































              but in the memory area selected by the <tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS,LOC2</i></tt>
              fields from <tt>ORGDD</tt> instead.&nbsp; Moreover, data
              is typically a full word of memory rather than a single
              syllable, so both syllables of each memory word are
              typically used for each data item.<br>
            </blockquote>
            <tt>USE DAT</tt>:<br>
            <blockquote>On other other hand, when <tt>USE DAT</tt> is
              in effect, I think only instructions are assembled, and
              data-allocated pseudo-ops like <tt>DEC</tt>, <tt>OCT</tt>,
              or <tt>BSS</tt> aren't used.&nbsp; There are two changes
              from <tt>USE INST</tt> in the way instructions are
              assembled.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Firstly, instructions are assembled in the memory area
              selected by the <tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS,LOC2</i></tt> fields
              from <tt>ORGDD</tt>.&nbsp; I.e., they appear in "data"
              memory rather than in "instruction" memory.&nbsp; But
              beyond that, successive instructions are not assembled
              into the same syllable of memory, but are instead
              assembled at alternating syllables: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0,
              .....&nbsp;&nbsp; (Notice that syllable 1 comes first in
              the sequence.)<br>
              <br>
              I'm not sure how the CPU responds to this ordering.&nbsp;
              The <tt>USE DAT</tt> context is often (though not always)
              associated with simplex memory configuration as selected
              by a <tt>CDSS</tt> instruction so perhaps this is really
              the order in which the CPU executes instructions in a
              simplex configuration.<br>

      in the leftmost column of the offending line.&nbsp; No explanation
      appears in the assembly listing of why any particular warning is
      issued.&nbsp; In the AS-206RAM assembly listing, the sequence
      numbers at which errors and warnings are found is as follows:<br>
    </p>

        038820<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <p>Sector shifts in the program flow:&nbsp; Recall that each 26-bit
      word of memory (not including the parity bit) consists of two
      13-bit syllables, referred to as syllable 0 and syllable 1.&nbsp;
      Each CPU instruction assembles to a single 13-bit value, and thus
      fits precisely within a single syllable, and any word in memory
      can simultaneously hold two separate instructions.&nbsp; When the
      CPU executes code in a given memory sector, it just sequences
      through all of the instructions in the currently-selected
      syllable.&nbsp; When the last-available word in the current
      syllable is reached, execution cannot continue.&nbsp; Rather than
      forcing the programmer to deal with this situation explicitly, the
      assembler steps in and transparently substitutes an extra
      instruction into the program flow to select a different syllable,
      sector, or module.&nbsp; So from the programmer's standpoint, he
      can just write an uninterrupted block of code without even
      worrying about the fact that it spans several different memory
      sectors.&nbsp; The code transparently modified by the assembler
      uses slightly more memory and execution time that it superficially
      appears to from the source code, but that <i>usually</i> doesn't
      matter.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>From the assembler's point of view, though, it's a bit more
      complicated.&nbsp; The simplest case is in reaching the end of
      syllable 0 for a given memory sector.&nbsp; The first (unused)
      location of syllable 1 of that same memory sector is accessible by
      a <tt>TRA</tt> instruction, so the assembler transparently
      inserts a <tt>TRA</tt> just before reaching the end of syllable
      0.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What happens when reaching the end of syllable 1 of a memory
      sector is much trickier.&nbsp; For one thing, various factors
      influence the usage of words at the ends of sectors in syllable 1,
      so it's a chore for the assembler just to figure out when the end
      of sector 1 has even been reached.&nbsp; The next problem is that
      once the end of syllable 1 has been reached, it can't simply
      switch to a new syllable:&nbsp; it instead has to switch to a
      different <i>sector</i> within the memory module, or perhaps even
      to a different memory module altogether.&nbsp; That can't be done
      with a simple <tt>TRA</tt> instruction, and requires a
      more-complex <tt>HOP</tt> instruction instead.&nbsp; Unlike a <tt>TRA</tt>
      instruction which encodes its target address within the
      instruction itself, a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction requires a
      variable containing the "HOP constant" of the target
      address.&nbsp; Naturally, no such variable containing the desired
      HOP constant normally exists.&nbsp; So in order to insert a <tt>HOP</tt>
      instruction, the assembler must first create such a
      variable:&nbsp; it must find an unused location in the current
      data sector or residual sector, and stick a HOP constant into it.</p>
    Those points at which a sector change is performed due to reaching
    the end of the sector, regardless of whether or not the assembler
    inserts any <tt>HOP</tt> or <tt>TRA</tt> instructions, is marked
    with a <tt>*</tt> in column 1 of the assembly listing.&nbsp; These
    transparently-inserted jumps are found at the following
    card-sequence numbers in the AS-206RAM listing:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>044700 047910 050170 052790 054910 057850 062640 065020

        </tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Assembly errors:&nbsp; Errors are marked in the leftmost column
      of the offending line by a character that presumably indicates the
      type of error.&nbsp; In the AS-206RAM assembly listing, the 7 such
      errors are found, and here are my interpretations of what they
      mean:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>U</tt> at sequence number 027140.&nbsp; The operand, <tt>CBNAV</tt>,
        is not a defined symbol.&nbsp; It appears as though it was
        probably correct in earlier software versions, but perhaps
        should have been changed to <tt>CBNAV1</tt> in this version.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>U</tt> at sequence number 029650.&nbsp; One of the macro
        parameters, <tt>CBRANW</tt>, is not a defined symbol.&nbsp;
        There is a handwritten note implying that it probably should
        have been <tt>TEMP6</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>O</tt> (no sequence number, p. 67).&nbsp; This is a
        full-line comment, but the necessary "<tt>*</tt>" character in
        column 1 has apparently been accidentally omitted.&nbsp;
        Therefore, the first word in the line (which happens to be "+")
        has been interpreted as an instruction, and naturally the
        assembler knows of no such instruction. <br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>V</tt> at sequence number 047930.&nbsp; The assembler
        mistakenly believes the target location, <tt>*-2</tt>,&nbsp; is
        out of range, because it has been fooled by an automatic switch
        from memory syllable 0 to syllable 1 slightly before.&nbsp; In
        fact, the target location actually <i>is</i> accessible by a <tt>TRA</tt>
        instruction (or a <tt>HOP</tt> instruction), but presumably the
        original assembler was not smart enough to figure that out.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>U</tt> (no sequence number, p. 187). The target location,
        <tt>TB5GO</tt>, is an undefined symbol.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>A</tt> (no sequence number, p. 188). The target variable,
        <tt>TBB</tt>, is defined, but is not located in either the
        current data sector or in the residual sector, and is therefore
        not accessible.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>O</tt> (no sequence number, p. 190). The target location
        of a jump, <tt>ORBGID</tt>, is not located in the current data
        sector.&nbsp; The instruction is <tt>TRA</tt>, and ordinarily
        that means that the assembler would automatically have used a <tt>HOP</tt>
        instruction in place of the <tt>TRA</tt>. For reasons that are
        unclear to me, the original assembler did not do so in this
        case, and instead simply discarded the instruction.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice that about half of the errors above occur on the (rare!)
      lines having no card-sequence number.&nbsp; I think that for
      pragmatic reasons, sequence numbers would usually have been left
      off of the punch-cards while the code was under development.&nbsp;
      Otherwise, they would have needed to be changed frequently, which
      would be a great inconvenience.&nbsp; In other words, the sequence
      numbers were likely only added once the code had reached a
      releasable form.&nbsp; Thus most of the errors appeared in areas
      of the code that were under active development, which is not
      terribly surprising.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Alas!&nbsp; There are 7 <i>more</i> errors exactly like the <tt>A</tt>
      type error listed above which the original assembler did not even
      detect.&nbsp; These are the pairs of lines of code at
      card-sequence numbers 026840, 026860, 026880, 026900, 026920,
      026940, and 026960.&nbsp; They're all of the form<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt><i>LABEL</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>CONSTANT</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <i>CONSTANT</i>+1<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Fortunately, it's easy to see how these latter 7 errors should be
      fixed.&nbsp; As it happens, there are quite a few examples on the
      same page of the assembly listing that make it clear the pattern
      should have instead been <br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt><i>LABEL</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; CDS &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>CONSTANT</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <i>CONSTANT</i>+1<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    Format of the source-code portion of the assembly listing:&nbsp;
    Consider a "normal" section of the listing, containing code,
    comments, etc., as opposed to report tables generated by the
    assembler, to which I've added some markup (in green) for
    explanatory purposes:<br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="anatomyCode.jpg" width="1005"
        height="310"> </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Columns IM, IS, S, LOC, DM, and DS:&nbsp; These columns are
        generated by the assembler and represent <a
          href="#Layout_of_Memory_Words">the fields of the HOP constant</a>
        associated with the line of code, from the viewpoint of the
        assembler.&nbsp; (The only HOP fields missing are DUPIN and
        DUPDN, which I suppose would be global settings affecting all
        memory, as opposed to varying on a line by line basis.)&nbsp; In
        particular, the IM and IS fields give the memory module and
        sector in which the line of code appears, and LOC gives the
        offset into the memory sector of the word in which the code for
        the instruction is stored.</li>
      <li>Columns A8-A1, A9, and OP:&nbsp; These columns are also
        generated by the assembler, and represent <a
          href="#Layout_of_Memory_Words">fields of the assembled
          instruction</a> associated with the line of code.&nbsp; In
        particular, OP is the octal value of the particular CPU
        instruction, <a href="#CPU_Instructions">as tabulated earlier</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Column CONSTANT:&nbsp; Yet another field generated by the
        assembler.&nbsp; Most lines don't have it, but it appears
        whenever the operand of the instruction is the address of a
        numerical constant stored at some other place in memory, but for
        which the assembler knows the value.&nbsp; For example, both of
        the lines in the sample above are the same, 342452244, because
        both of them relate to a <tt>HOP SCPOLY</tt> instruction.&nbsp;
        As I've already explained above, what the assembler does with a
        line of code like this is to find the <tt>SCPOLY</tt> routine
        (which conveniently for us, actually appears in sample above as
        well), figures out its HOP constant, allocates a word of memory,
        stores the HOP constant at that location, and then embeds the
        address of that location into the instruction.&nbsp; You can
        actually see all that happening in the sample.&nbsp; The HOP
        constant itself corresponds to the values IM=4, IS=04, S=1,
        LOC=124, DM=2, DS=14 at the line of code <tt>SCPOLY STO 777</tt>.&nbsp;




















































































        I know it's probably tough to do those conversions in your head,
        so a handy python script (<a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaASM.py/unHOP.py">unHOP.py</a>)
        is available that can do it for you; and in fact, if you feed
        342452244 into unHOP.py, the expected values of IM, IS, S, etc.,
        pop out.&nbsp; (You also get the extra info that DUPIN=1 and
        DUPDN=1 ... more on which below.)&nbsp; Moreover, if you look at
        the lines where the constant appears, namely the lines reading
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <tt>HOP SCPOLY</tt>, and you look at the assembled code, you'll
        see that the address at which the HOP constant is stored must be
        DM=2, DS=14, LOC=342.</li>
      <li>Column EXPANSION:&nbsp; The final field generated by the
        assembler.&nbsp; It contains the character '+' for instructions
        which have been expanded from the <tt>CALL</tt> macro, but is
        blank otherwise.&nbsp; Whether there are other things that can
        appear there, I can't say.</li>
      <li>Columns LEFT-HAND SYMBOL, INSTRUCTION, OPERAND, COMMENT,
        SEQUENCE:&nbsp; I've covered these above, and suspect that they
        may come directly from the punch cards, unchanged.</li>
    </ul>
    The Segment Cross Reference table:&nbsp; This appears near the end
    of the assembly listing, and is generated by the assembler.&nbsp;
    Here's a small sample:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="anatomyXref.jpg" width="1328"
        height="74"><br>
    </div>
    <p>What the cross reference does is list each symbol in the program,
      tell you where it appears in memory, and then tells you how to
      find all <i>uses</i> of that symbol in the code.&nbsp; It should
      be pretty obvious to you that in this example, the symbol <tt>UTEMP1</tt>
      is in memory module 2, sector 17, at address 174.&nbsp; It may or
      may not be obvious that where the symbol is <i>used</i> is at the
      line SEQUENCE numbers 085370, 116640, etc.&nbsp; Alas, the few
      pages of the assembly listing which I've elected to freely expose
      do not include the one which <tt>UTEMP1</tt> is allocated, but
      does include several examples of where it is used.&nbsp; For
      example, if you look at the sample code I've marked up in green
      just a bit above, you can see it used at SEQUENCE number 117600,
      just as expected.&nbsp; Not all lines of code have SEQUENCE
      numbers, and in those cases the SEQUENCE number appearing in the
      table are generated by simply adding 10 to last card having an
      explicit SEQUENCE number.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Although I haven't shown any examples in the image above, memory
      locations which the assembler itself automatically allocates also
      appear in the segment cross reference table.&nbsp; Recall that
      there are cases where the assembler transparently allocates memory
      locations to store values of constants (like the values of
      numerical expressions or HOP constants) which are referenced
      on-the-fly without being explicitly defined in the source
      code.&nbsp; These variables are distinguished by having no
      symbolic name.&nbsp; Instead they are referenced by their unique
      values rather than by symbolic name.&nbsp; I.e., their unique
      values are used as if they were their symbolic names.&nbsp; Hence
      what appears in the table in place of a name is the 9-octal-digit
      value stored at the location.&nbsp; They appear in the table after
      all of the symbolic names.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The octal listing of the program:&nbsp; This is generated by the
      assembler and appears at the very end of the listing.&nbsp; It
      simply shows what appears at each memory location in the modules,
      as either a single 26-bit octal word or as two 13-bit
      syllables.&nbsp; So you can see in the octal table what each
      instruction and each pseudo-op assembles to in octal form.&nbsp;
      In each of the numbered columns of the table, syllable 1 of the
      memory word is on the left and syllable 0 is on the right.&nbsp;
      For example, referring to the image below, in module 2, sector 00,
      location 0201 (or 2-00-0201 for short), syllable 1 has the value
      10170 and syllable 0 has the value 00174.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>It's important to understand the alignment of the data shown in
      the octal listing:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>26-bit data words (none of which are shown below) are shifted
        1 bit to the left, and thus displayed as 9 octal digits.&nbsp;
        The least-significant bit is always 0.</li>
      <li>13-bit instructions, syllable 1, are shifted 2 bits to the
        left, and thus displayed as 5 octal digits.&nbsp; The
        least-significant 2 bits are always 0.</li>
      <li>13-bit instructions, syllable 0, are shifted 1 bit to the
        left, and thus displayed as 5 octal digits.&nbsp; The
        most-significant and least-significant bit are always 0.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This seems weird — the instruction alignment in particular! — but
      I suppose the rationale is that the open bit positions correspond
      to the positions of parity bits.&nbsp; The assembler itself does
      not bother to compute the parity bits for you, and thus represents
      them all as 0.&nbsp; If you take an instruction from syllable 1
      and one from syllable 0 as shown in the table, overlap the
      least-significant <i>octal digit</i> from the left-hand
      instruction with the most-significant octal digit from the
      right-hand instruction, then bitwise OR them (or add them), you
      get the full contents of the memory word.&nbsp; For example,
      taking the first two instructions shown below (63224 12436), the
      full 26-bit content of address 2-00-000, left-aligned, is:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>&nbsp; 63224<br>
        +&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12436</u><br>
        &nbsp; 632252436<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <p>However, there's no doubt that the visual representation of this
      data is undoubtedly weird.&nbsp; And, it's unclear just how useful
      it is ... certainly not at all, if you're trying to disassemble
      the instructions by eye!&nbsp; I've provided a handy python script
      (<a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaASM.py/unOP.py">unOP.py</a>)
      that you can use to provide a simple-minded disassembly of the
      instructions found in the octal listing.&nbsp; The script assumes
      that if an octal number you give it has a leading space character
      then it is in syllable 0, and that if it has no leading space it
      is in syllable l.&nbsp; For example, feeding "63224" into it gives
      back "MPH 315", while feeding " 12436" into it gives back "CLA
      124".<br>

    <h2><a name="MIT_Instrumentation_Laboratory_vs_IBM"></a>MIT
      Instrumentation Laboratory vs IBM Federal Systems Division</h2>
    The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (which designed the Apollo
    Guidance Computer) had nothing to do with the LVDC, and conversely
    IBM Federal Systems Division (which designed the LVDC) had nothing
    to do with the AGC.&nbsp; However, since IBM was an important
    manufacturer of computers (indeed, it designed the Gemini on-board
    computer system), whereas MIT/IL was emphatically <i>not</i>, there
    was an understandable feeling by some that the Apollo program might
    better be served by an IBM on-board guidance computer in the Command
    Module and Lunar Module than by newly-designed computer from novice
    MIT/IL.<br>
    <br>
    Accordingly, IBM proposed that the LVDC be used in place of the AGC
    in the CM and LM, and in 1963, it produced a big, two volume report
    (<a href="Documents/IBMStudyReport-63-928-129-Volume1.pdf">here</a>
    and <a href="Documents/IBMStudyReport-63-928-130-Volume2.pdf"> here</a>)
    to support their proposal.&nbsp; The Instrumentation Labs fired back
    their own critiques, shredding IBM's report to the extent
    possible.&nbsp; And in <a
      href="Documents/CritiqueOfIBMApolloStudyReport.pdf"> one of those
      critiques</a>, we have a few precious gems of LVDC assembly
    language, as written by the Instrumentation Labs personnel rather
    than by IBM. Perhaps I'm making too much of this sample code, but
    for years and years it was the only purported LVDC code we had any
    access to, and as the only LVDC code then thought still to exist,
    perhaps over the span of a decade or so it used up more of my mind
    share than it ought.<br>
    <br>
    Whether it's good LVDC code or bad LVDC code, who knows?&nbsp; I can
    tell you that it would certainly bomb out when run through our
    modern assembler, and presumably would do so when run through IBM's
    original one ... so it's very unlikely that the good folks at MIT/IL
    had any access either to the original IBM assembler, or even to any
    samples of IBM-written source code.&nbsp; They were either using
    their imaginations, or perhaps wrote their own assembler for it,
    using their own home-grown syntax.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Perhaps
    some day I'll go through it and fix up the syntax enough to run it
    through the assembler and emulator.<br>
    <br>
    Whether or not it's good code, here's what it looked like.&nbsp; The
    '#' characters indicate the beginnings of comments, and as usual,
    were added by me rather then originally being present in the sample
    code.<br>

          LVDC/PTC CPU Emulation</big></small></h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"><i>The LVDC/PTC CPU emulator is a
          work in progress, so the information in this section may not
          yet be totally reliable.</i><br>
        <br>
        An important proviso regarding CPU emulation is that the
        original physical LVDCs installed in the Saturn rockets were not
        by themselves fast enough to keep up with the real-time
        calculations needed to directly control the rocket.&nbsp; The
        LVDC could only update the control signals it was outputting
        about 25 times a second ... and while that may <i>seem</i>
        fast, it's not fast enough when you're controlling a powerful
        beast like the Saturn V rocket.&nbsp; The control signals output
        by the LVDC if used directly, as is, would have been too
        stair-steppy, too choppy.&nbsp; 25 outputs per second isn't
        enough!&nbsp; So the LVDC's output signals didn't directly
        control the rocket.&nbsp; What happened instead is that a
        separate unit — the LVD<i>A</i> — was needed to accept the
        digital outputs from the LVDC and turn them into
        smoothly-changing controls for the rocket. And when I say
        smoothly-changing, I mean both smoothly in <i>time</i> as well
        as in terms of electrical properties. Thus any emulation of the
        LVDC that could acceptably control the rocket would additionally
        require emulation of the LVDA.&nbsp; But the yaLVDC program does
        <i>not</i> do that; it emulates the LVDC and nothing more!&nbsp;
        If you want to emulate the LVDA or anything else connected to
        the LVDC, additional emulation software is needed beyond just
        yaLVDC.<br>
        <br>
        Another interesting aspect of the LVDC is that since it was
        essentially a "black box" that outputted real-time control
        signals in response to real-time inputs, it is possible to
        create a reasonably satisfactory behavioral simulation for it in
        the absence of the original software, since we know the <a
          href="Documents/SaturnVLaunchVehicleGuidanceEquations.pdf">
          guidance equations</a> relating the outputs to the
        inputs.&nbsp; The yaLVDC software does <i>not</i> do that; it
        emulates the LVDC or PTC CPU, whether you have loaded into it
        any LVDC software that implements the guidance equations or
        not.&nbsp; Perhaps all you load into the emulation is something
        as trivial as LVDC software that just counts from 1 to
        1000.&nbsp; No matter, yaLVDC doesn't care what the LVDC/PTC
        software <i>does</i>, it will run it just the same!&nbsp; With
        that said, while creating behavior simulations is not an
        objective of the Virtual AGC project as far as the Apollo CPUs
        are concerned, there are people engaged in creating such
        simulations for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span>
        NASSP project and elsewhere.<br>

    The yaLVDC program currently has to be build from its <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaLVDC">source








      code</a>.&nbsp; Building it requires the GNU C compiler ("gcc")
    and the GNU "make" program.&nbsp; Simply download the source code,
    "cd" into the folder containing it (which is the "yaLVDC" folder in
    the Virtual AGC software repository), and run the command
    "make".&nbsp; You should then add yaLVDC to your PATH, so that it
    can be easily found later by the operating system.<br>
    <br>
    In order to run an LVDC or PTC emulation, you first have have some
    LVDC or PTC software to load into it, and that LVDC/PTC software
    must have been assembled by <a
      href="#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">the yaASM.py assembler
      which is covered in the next section</a>.&nbsp; In any given
    assembly, the assembler produces 3 output files which are required
    as input to yaLVDC.&nbsp; These are called yaASM.tsv (the octal
    listing of the initial memory contents), yaASM.sym (the symbol
    table), and yaASM.src (the source code, as related to specific
    memory locations and source-code line numbers).&nbsp; These files
    can be moved to any folder you like, and renamed anything you like,
    as long as they retain the extensions .tsv, .sym, and .src.<br>
    <br>
    You invoke the LVDC/PTC emulator with the command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaLVDC [<i>OPTIONS</i>] --assembly=<i>path/to/the/LVDC/or/PTC/executable</i></tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    For example, you might already be in the folder containing PTC
    executables (which perhaps you've renamed PAST.tsv, PAST.sym, and
    PAST.src), and yaLVDC might be in your PATH, and the command might
    be<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaLVDC --ptc --cold-start --assembly=PAST</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Here's a list of the <tt><i>OPTIONS</i></tt> available right now,
    though using the command "yaLVDC --help" might give a more
    up-to-date list.<br>

            LVDC/PTC files, <i>minus</i> the filename extensions (.tsv,
            .sym, .src).&nbsp; For example, if you hadn't renamed the
            executable files output by the assembler, and if those were
            in the current folder, it would just be <tt>--assembly=yaASM</tt>.&nbsp;








            Or if you had renamed them (say) MyProgram.tsv,
            MyProgram.sym, and MyProgram.src, and were in the folder
            .../test/, then it would be <tt>--assembly=../test/MyProgram</tt>.&nbsp;

            filesystem.&nbsp; On Windows, I think that either '/' or the
            usual Windows backslash separator '\' would be accepted.)<br>
            <br>
            Eventually, multiple <tt>--assembly</tt> switches would be
            allowed on a single yaLVDC command line, allowing
            simultaneous loading of separately assembled program
            components at nonoverlapping locations in memory.&nbsp; This
            is necessary because (as described above) the LVDC Flight
            Program did not completely fill memory, and required the
            presence of other programs (such as the Preflight Program)
            to function properly.&nbsp; The PTC ADAPT Self Test Program,
            on the other hand is complete and relies on no other
            software.&nbsp; At present, though, the ability to have
            multiple programs simultaneously loaded is not yet
            implemented.<br>

            <br>
            This <i>superficially</i> appears to be the opposite of
            --run, but in fact it is not.&nbsp; In fact, <tt>--panel-pause</tt>
            would generally be used with <tt>--run</tt>, or not at
            all.&nbsp; The explanation is that while LVDC emulations
            have a single debugger, namely the gdb-based one built
            natively into yaLVDC, PTC emulations instead have two
            debuggers that are essentially separate an
            independent.&nbsp; The first of these is still yaLVDC's
            native debugger, but the second one is based instead on the
            PTC front panel.&nbsp; While the two debuggers can be used
            at the same time, to a certain extent, they are not designed
            to do so.&nbsp; Normally, therefore, when using PTC
            front-panel based debugging, one would let the emulation
            free-run from the yaLVDC debugger's point of view, so the
            command-line switches <tt>--run --panel-paused</tt> would
            be used together.&nbsp; Conversely, when using yaLVDC based
            debugging, one would let the CPU run freely from the PTC
            panel's point of view, and thus neither of those
            command-line switches would be used.<br>

    As mentioned above, by default the emulation runs in a debugging
    interface intended to allow you do things like single-step the
    LVDC/PTC software, set breakpoints, examine or change memory or
    registers, etc.&nbsp; The interface is loosely based on the GNU "<a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a>" debugger, but is
    a limited form of it.&nbsp; Once yaLVDC is running, but the
    emulation is halted at a debugger command line, you can get a
    complete list of the available debugger commands with the the
    command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>HELP<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    Some useful command you'll read about there are <tt>STEP</tt>
    (single-step some number of instructions), <tt>NEXT</tt> (single
    step instructions, but executing subroutines as block without
    seeming to descend into them), <tt>BREAK</tt> (set breakpoint), <tt>X</tt>
    (examine memory), <tt>SET</tt> (change memory contents), <tt>BACKTRACE</tt>
    (list the jumps that got us to the present point in the program),
    and so on.&nbsp; yaLVDC does not presently have the ability to be
    embedded within GUI debuggers such as Code::Blocks, but hopefully
    someday it might.<br>
    <blockquote> </blockquote>
    <i>Example:</i> Let's the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program without any
    emulated peripheral devices, thus being dependent on the built-in
    yaLVDC debugger.&nbsp; Assuming you had copied the assembler's
    output files (yaASM.tsv, yaASM.src, and yaASM.sym; see the next
    section) into the folder containing yaLVDC, you'd start the program
    something like this:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="left"><tt>./yaLVDC --ptc --cold-start --assembly=yaASM</tt><br>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    yaLVDC starts up and then pauses prior to emulating the very first
    instruction in the PAST program, giving you a "debugger" interface
    that may be something like this:<br>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;<tt>HOP = 000000000
        (ADR=0-00-0-000/0-00)&nbsp;&nbsp; VAL = 01037&nbsp;&nbsp; ACC =

      </tt><tt>&gt; </tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What this is trying to do is to compactly display a lot of info
      about the state of the CPU and of the emulation itself:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The emulation has paused at code address 0-00-0-000 (i.e.,
        instruction module 0, instruction sector 00, syllable 0,
        location 000), with a "HOP constant" of 000000000. </li>
      <li>The data context (for fetching or saving variables in memory)
        is 0-00 (i.e., data module 0, data sector 00).</li>
      <li>The value stored at the code address (i.e., the numerical
        representation of the next instruction to be emulated) is 01037<sub>8</sub>.</li>
      <li>The value stored in the accumulator is 0.</li>
      <li>The memory locations often designated as 777 and 776, used to
        store return addresses of subroutines, are currently empty;
        i.e., nothing has yet been stored in them.</li>
      <li>"RET" refers to the so-called "HOP save" register, which
        currently is 0-00-0-000 (code) and 0-00 (data).&nbsp; The HOP
        save register contains the code address and data context of the
        instruction in memory that immediately follows the last
        instruction that was executed.&nbsp; In other words, usually
        this will just be the same as the current code address and data
        context.&nbsp; But if the previously-executed instruction sas a
        <tt>HOP</tt>, <tt>TRA</tt>, <tt>TNZ</tt>, or <tt>TMI</tt>,
        and thus the current instruction was out of order with the last
        one executed, then the HOP save register will differ from the
        current HOP constant.&nbsp; So in that case, the HOP save
        register is basically the return address from the immediately
        preceding <tt>HOP</tt>, <tt>TRA</tt>, <tt>TNZ</tt>, or <tt>TMI</tt>.&nbsp;

        The program then must immediately use a <tt>STO 777</tt> or <tt>STO

          776</tt> to save the return address, or else the information
        is permanently lost.</li>
      <li>So far (suprise!), 0 instructions have been executed, 0
        instruction cycles have elapsed, and that has taken 0 seconds of
        real time.</li>
      <li>The current address corresponds to source-code line
        #369.&nbsp; However, the line numbers shown do not relate to
        line numbers in the PAST program source file
        (PTC-ADAPT-Self-Test-Program.lvdc), but rather to the line
        numbers in the yaASM.src file.&nbsp; That's because the LVDC/PTC
        assembler is a macro assembler, in which a single line of source
        code may sometimes be transparently converted to several
        LVDC/PTC instructions.&nbsp; For example, in the PTC, the
        "instruction" <tt>SHL 25</tt> is really the sequence of
        instructions <tt>SHL 6 / SHL 6 / SHL 6 / SHL 6 / SHL 1</tt>.&nbsp;






        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The source-code line associated with the current memory
        location is "<tt>L1P1 CLA ZERO</tt>".&nbsp; As it happens, all
        LVDC/PTC software is potentially self-modifying, and all of the
        original LVDC/PTC source code at our disposal is actually
        self-modifying.&nbsp; If the instruction value found at the
        current code address is different than the one the debugger
        expected to find, the debugger will show you both the original
        source line and for comparison a source line that it generates
        by disassembling the current instruction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, the final "<tt>&gt;</tt>" is a user-prompt, indicating
      that the debugger is waiting for user input, and as I said above,
      wherever possible those commands are based on gdb.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>So, for instance, if we used the command <tt>LIST</tt>, we'd see
      the following:<br>

    In this case, the original source code has been ignored, but the
    disassembler has recreated a sort of facsimile of it by analyzing
    the contents of memory.&nbsp; That's important, because LVDC/PTC
    code is self-modifying ... i.e., it sometimes replaces the
    instructions originally in memory with different ones.&nbsp; The
    regeneration of the source code by <tt>DISASSEMBLE</tt> is quite
    good, and the disassembly looks much like the original.&nbsp; In
    some ways it's even more useful than the original, though lacking
    comments, since it not only tells you the names of variables, but
    goes out of its way to tell you what values are stored in those
    variables.&nbsp; You do notice a few differences, such as <tt>VAR3</tt>
    in the one vs <tt>V3</tt> in the other.&nbsp; That's because <tt>VAR3</tt>
    and <tt>V3</tt> are <i>synonyms</i> in the original source code
    (via the <tt>SYN</tt> pseudo-op), so the disassembler has no way to
    know which of the two synonyms was originally used ... but it
    doesn't matter.&nbsp; You may also see things that you at first <i>think</i>
    are bugs: for example, at address <tt>0-00-0-017</tt>, you find an
    "<tt>ADD =O000000002</tt>" instruction, for which you're helpfully
    informed that the value stored in memory for <tt>=O000000002</tt>
    is really <tt>000000001</tt>.&nbsp; A discrepancy?&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
    In constructs like <tt>=O000000002</tt> in LVDC/PTC assembly
    language, the 26-bit data is aligned at the most-significant (27th)
    bit when stored in memory, leaving the least-significant bit open
    for storing parity.&nbsp; In other words, from a "modern" point of
    view, they're left-shifted on place from where they ought to
    be.&nbsp; So <tt>=O000000002</tt> is really, logically, the integer
    1.&nbsp; A nice, constant source of confusion!&nbsp;<img

    <h2><a name="yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler"
        id="yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler"></a>yaASM.py, the
      LVDC/PTC Cross-Assembler</h2>
    The original IBM 360 based LVDC assembler used during Project Apollo
    itself is no longer available 50+ years later ... or at least, not
    available to <i>us</i>.&nbsp; So I've written an LVDC assembler
    completely from scratch.&nbsp; It's capable of accepting the
    original LVDC AS206-RAM Flight Program or the PTC ADAPT Self-Test
    Program, and producing an assembly listing similar to the original
    one, as well as an executable image (i.e., a list of the contents of
    all memory locations) that's 100% identical to the memory contents
    listed in the original printouts.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In saying this, I suppose it's important to reiterate that while we
    have decent contemporaneous documentation of the LVDC/PTC
    instruction set, we have no contemporaneous documentation whatsoever
    of the format of LVDC assembly language, and specifically of the
    pseudo-ops or operand syntax of the language.&nbsp; In other words,
    while the new assembler works with the LVDC/PTC language
    documentation as described on this web page, portions of this web
    page's documentation are based on what I've personally inferred from
    reading the specific LVDC/PTR program printouts available to
    me.&nbsp; A listing of a different version of the original LVDC or
    PTC software, were one to become available, could easily have
    features which I've never seen before and which therefore are not
    yet accounted for in the new assembler.<br>
    <br>
    With that warning out of the way, <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaASM.py">the












































      modern LVDC assembler is called yaASM.py and is available in the
      Virtual AGC software repository</a>.&nbsp; Both the files yaASM.py
    and expression.py found there are necessary for running the
    assembler.&nbsp; As the naming implies, the assembler is written in
    the Python language — specifically Python 3, and it will not work
    with Python 2.&nbsp; Python programs such as this assembler are
    ready to run, as-is, and require no preparation or setup other than
    installation of Python itself.<br>
    <br>
    (Note:&nbsp; The yaASM.py program should not be confused with the
    yaASM program, which also appears in the repository.&nbsp; yaASM is
    an assembler program for Gemini OBC assembly language.&nbsp; The
    naming of these two programs is similar due to the fact that the
    LVDC and OBC are such similar computers.&nbsp; The original
    intention was that yaASM would be able to handle both OBC and LVDC
    assembly languages.&nbsp; However, yaASM was written in advance of
    any <i>true</i> samples of LVDC source code becoming
    available.&nbsp; When true LVDC samples became available much later,
    the inadequacy of yaASM with respect to the language features that
    it would need to handle became apparent, and the idea of using yaASM
    for the LVDC was abandoned.)<br>
    <br>
    Usage of the LVDC assembler is quite simple:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaASM.py [<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<i>OCTALS</i>.tsv] &lt;<i>INPUT</i>.lvdc










        &gt;<i>OUTPUT</i>.lst</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    By default the assembler targets the LVDC and expect LVDC-specific
    source code as input.&nbsp; To target the PTC instead, the
    command-line switch --ptc is required.&nbsp; Specifically, I'd
    recommend the following commands for the AS206-RAM Flight Program
    and the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>yaASM.py LVDC-AS206RAM.tsv &lt;LVDC-AS206RAM.lvdc
        &gt;</tt><tt><i>assembly.listing</i></tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>yaASM.py --ptc [--past-bugs]
        PTC-ADAPT-Self-Test-Program.tsv
        &lt;PTC-ADAPT-Self-Test-Program.lvdc &gt;</tt><tt><i>assembly.listing</i></tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    Notice that the <tt>--past-bugs</tt> switch is shown as
    optional.&nbsp; If present, it mimics a bug in the original PTC
    assembler which botched messages in the output assembly listing
    associated with the <tt>BCI</tt> pseudo-op.&nbsp; If the <tt>--past-bugs</tt>
    switch is omitted, more-helpful non-botched messages appear
    instead.&nbsp; The octal executable is not affected by the use or
    disuse of <tt>--past-bugs</tt>.<br>
    <br>
    The assembler simply takes an input file of LVDC or PTC source code
    (<i>INPUT</i>.lvdc), and produces as output a human-readable
    assembly listing (<i>OUTPUT</i>.lst).&nbsp; Additionally, it
    produces the following files:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>yaASM.tsv — an octal listing of the assembled code</li>
      <li>yaASM.sym&nbsp; — a symbol table</li>
      <li>yaASM.src — an address-by-address listing of source code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these files is ASCII, with tabs delimiting fields.&nbsp;
      (Or in the case of the .src file, UTF-8 rather than ASCII if any
      non-ASCII characters appear in the input LVDC/PTC source-code
      comments.)&nbsp; They are intended to be easily machine readable,
      for use as the inputs to our (eventual) LVDC/PTC emulator
      software.&nbsp; The files are produced whether or not there are
      fatal errors in the assembly process, so don't take their
      existence as an indication that assembly succeeded.&nbsp; The
      format of the files will be discussed in a moment.<br>
    </p>
    There is also an optional <i>input</i> file (<i>OCTALS</i>.tsv) for
    the assembly process.&nbsp; <i>OCTALS</i>.tsv, if available, is a
    tab-delimited octal listing of an LVDC rope in the same format as
    the original LVDC/PTC assembly listing.&nbsp; Note, by the way, that
    the original LVDC and PTC assemblers used somewhat different formats
    for octal fields, thus the input files for LVDC octals and PTC
    octals differ somewhat.&nbsp; If present, OCTALS.tsv is not used for
    generating the assembled output; rather, the assembler performs a
    comparison during the assembly process of the contents of the input
    file <i>OCTALS</i>.tsv against that of the eventual output file
    yaASM.tsv, and provides messages indicating mismatches between the
    two.&nbsp; This can be helpful in validating the transcription of
    the input source code or the action of the assembler.<br>
    <br>
    In contrast, the <i>output</i> octal listing file (yaASM.tsv)
    always conforms to the (superior) LVDC format, even if the input
    files were in PTC format. <br>
    <br>
    Rather than describe any of these tab-delimited file formats in
    detail here, I'd suggest that they're reasonably straightforward,
    and you can simply look at the files themselves to get a better idea
    of how they work.<br>
    <h2><a name="Running_the_PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program"></a>Running
      the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program in the LVDC/PTC Emulator</h2>
    <p align="center"><font size="+1"><i>(This section represents work
          in progress, and is itself under construction.&nbsp; Don't
          rely on it very much!)</i></font><br>
    </p>
    <p>In so far as the PAST program is concerned, all of the above
      comes together when we run it in the emulator, and verify that the
      CPU tests the PAST program implements pass.&nbsp; Or fail!&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Assuming you have followed through on the advice in the preceding
      two sections, you have likely built the LVDC/PTC emulator program
      (yaLVDC), have placed it in your PATH, and have assembled the PAST
      program itself, thus producing the files the emulator needs
      (yaASM.tsv, yaASM.src, and yaASM.sym) to actually emulate the PAST
      program.&nbsp; The instructions below assume also that you have
      copied those files (yaASM.tsv, .src, and .sym) into the same
      folder that contains the yaLVDC source code and executable ... but
      if you're happy to accordingly adapt the instructions I'm going to
      give you, you don't need to do so.<br>
    </p>
    <p>That same yaLVDC folder <i>also</i> contains a program not
      mentioned so far:&nbsp; yaPTC.py.&nbsp; This Python 3 program is a
      crude emulation of the PTC's front panel; i.e., of the various
      control panels containing the indicator lamps, pushbuttons, and so
      forth, which are expected to be present when using the PTC.&nbsp;
      You need to run not only yaLVDC, but also yaPTC.py in order to
      expect anything meaningful to happen when you emulate the PAST
      program.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To run the emulation, my advice would be to open up two separate
      command lines, 'cd' in both of them to the yaLVDC folder.&nbsp; On
      the first command line, you'd start up the emulated CPU with a
      command like:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>./yaLVDC --ptc --cold-start --run --panel-pause
        --assembly=yaASM<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    With this combination of switches, the emulated CPU is "running", in
    the sense that no yaLVDC debugging interface appears, but no
    instructions are being executed.&nbsp; Rather, the PTC CPU halts at
    power-up and waits for commands from the PTC front panel.&nbsp; This
    is the behavior the original PTC had as well.<br>
    <br>
    On the seconds of the two command lines, you'd use this command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>./yaPTC.py</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    yaPTC.py starts up and begins trying to connect to yaLVDC.&nbsp; As
    mentioned earlier, the two programs interconnect using what I call
    "virtual wire", which is a networking system in which yaLVDC is a
    "server" and yaPTC.py is its client.&nbsp; By default, the
    assumptions of this system are appropriate for the case of yaLVDC
    and yaPTC.py running on the same computer, but there's nothing to
    stop you from running them on two entirely separate computers.&nbsp;
    Hopefully, a message will appear that says:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>Connected.</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    <a href="yaPTC-screenshot.png"><img src="yaPTC-screenshot-small.png"
        title="Click to enlarge" alt="" width="698" height="400"
        border="2" align="right"></a>At any rate, once started, yaPTC's
    simulated control panel should then appear, and it will appear
    something like the screenshot to the right (click to enlarge).<br>
    <br>
    The interface is graphical, so further interaction with it involves
    observing emulated indicator lamps turn on or off, clicking on
    controls representing pushbuttons or toggle switches, etc.&nbsp; An
    example in the screenshot to the right is the PROG ERR indicator,
    located approximately midway down at the far right of the
    interface.&nbsp; It lights up under control of the PAST program,
    after the program has found an error when running its
    self-tests.&nbsp; But once the PROG ERR lamp lights, the PTC CPU
    (and hence the PAST program) has no programmatic way to reset
    it.&nbsp; Instead, the PROG ERR indicator is a pushbutton in
    addition to being an indicator lamp; to reset the PROG ERR lamp
    (i.e., turn it black), you were supposed to physically press the
    PROG ERR pushbutton.&nbsp; Or in the case of the emulation, you
    click PROG ERR on the emulated panel.<br>
    <br>
    There is a certain <i>apparent</i> overlap between functionality
    provided by yaPTC and the yaLVDC debugger interface, since part of
    the purpose of the original PTC was to provide debugging
    capability.&nbsp; For example, both provide the ability to
    single-step through the PAST program software or to set
    breakpoints.&nbsp; But they are two separate capabilities that
    operate independently of each other: I implemented the yaLVDC
    debugger to have features I thought would be useful to me, and yaPTC
    separately implements what the original IBM developers thought would
    be useful to them.&nbsp; Indeed, to use the debugging capabilities
    of the PTC panel interface, you would normally instruct the yaLVDC
    debugger to free-run the PAST program, without subsequently using
    in-built features of the yaLVDC debugger, while to use the
    capabilities of the yaLVDC debugger you'd set the PTC panel for free
    running of the CPU.<br>
    <br>
    yaPTC.py has a few command-line options that could prove to be of
    use sometimes as well:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>--host=<i>IP</i></tt> to select the network host running
        yaLVDC.&nbsp; By default it's "localhost" (127.0.0.1, the local
        computer), but if you want to run yaLVDC on a different computer
        than yaPTC.py, it could be any host name recognized by your
        computer or any IPv4 address (like 192.168.0.123).<br>
      </li>
      <li> <tt>--port=<i>N</i></tt> to select the networking port yaPTC
        uses to find yaLVDC.&nbsp; The default is 19653.</li>
      <li><tt>--resize=1</tt> to make the yaPTC window resizable.&nbsp;
        By default I make it non-resizable, simply because I haven't put
        in any of the effort needed to make it resize <i>gracefully</i>,
        and because I personally have lots of display-screen real estate
        ... but that's of no help to you if you're stuck on a tiny
        laptop screen, so for whatever it's worth, the option is at
        least here for you to try it out if need be.</li>
      <li><tt>--help</tt> to get a full list of available command-line
        switches.</li>
    </ul>

          height="256" border="0" align="right"></a>Before getting into
      the details of how to work with the PAST program's test procedures
      in the emulation, you may want to have a little familiarity with
      the PTC's physical layout.&nbsp; I suppose, in theory, that you
      could run the self tests entirely from yaLVDC's debugger without
      using the PTC's panels and other peripheral devices, but the test
      procedures are not written in a way that facilitates that, so it
      would be much harder to do so.&nbsp; And it wouldn't be as fun.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The photo to the left gives you an overview of some of the
      portions of the PTC main console used in the emulation.&nbsp; The
      Tape Reader and Mode Control Panel, though shown, isn't actually
      needed by the emulation, since the software is loaded from
      yaLVDC's command line rather than from a tape drive.&nbsp; The
      Tape Reader, by the way, accepted a punched tape, not a magnetic
      tape.&nbsp; One of the test procedures refers specifically to a
      short paper tape, although perhaps longer mylar tapes may have
      been used when the PAST program was read.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, among the items truly needed by the emulation,
      the C. E. Panel apparently hadn't been installed when the
      photograph was taken, so our handy caption just points to an empty
      space.&nbsp; How the C. E. panel fits into the indicated space in
      the PTC cabinet isn't clear to me, but that's life!&nbsp;
      Hopefully the photo gives you an idea of the general layout, in
      spite of its deficiencies.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We do know that the printer (photo to the right) was an IBM 1443,
      and that the plotter was a Calcomp 565. </p>
    <p>The Typewriter peripheral isn't shown.&nbsp; I haven't been able
      to determine a model number (and thus obtain a photograph of
      one).&nbsp; It printed stuff and had a keyboard, so what more is
      there to know about its visual appearance, really?&nbsp; I would
      hazard a guess that it was a modified IBM Selectric Typewriter,
      for whatever an uninformed guess from me is worth.<br>

    <p>To run the test procedures in the PAST program, the principal PTC
      interfaces you have to interact with are the three control panels,
      which are obviously a bit too small to see in the photo above, so
      below you'll find a more-detailed representation of those.&nbsp;
      Clicking on any of them should give you enlarged view.&nbsp; Not
      everything you see is reproduced in the emulation, because not all
      of it is relevant to emulation of the PTC's CPU or running the
      PAST program's self-test procedures.&nbsp; For example, the
      emulated PTC has no power supplies, so emulating the Power Control
      area of the Processor Display Panel would be rather
      pointless.&nbsp; Also, to be blunt, the thrill of putting a lot of
      effort into making emulations that visually mimic the original
      physical devices as worn thin for me over the decades, so don't
      expect yaPTC.py to duplicate every little nuance of the original
      panel layouts shown here:<br>

    The PAST-program test-procedures you can run are all covered in
    chapter V of <a href="Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf">the PTC
      documentation</a>.&nbsp; The first few calibration procedures and
    test procedures covered there are of no particular use to us, since
    they relate to irrelevant hardware characteristics of the PTC itself
    rather than to its CPU or software.&nbsp; For example, the PTC had
    physical power-supply circuitry which needed to be adjusted and
    checked for proper voltage levels.&nbsp; The emulated PTC has no
    such thing.&nbsp; At some point, though, the descriptions of the
    test procedures begin to mention that they "can not be performed
    unless the special program has been loaded into the central
    processor memory".&nbsp; That "special program", of course, is the
    PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program (PAST program), and it's at that point
    that the test procedures become interesting to us.&nbsp; The
    relevant tests include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Figure 7-7, "memory loader manual checks".&nbsp; (Page V-7-67,
        or 251 of document PDF.)<br>
      </li>
      <li> Figure 7-8, "data display check".&nbsp; (Page V-7-87, or 271
        of document PDF.)</li>
      <li>Figure 7-9, "central processor manual checks".&nbsp; (Page
        V-7-102, or 286 of document PDF.)</li>
      <li>Figure 7-10, "central processor memory automatic
        checks".&nbsp; (Page V-7-158, or 342 of document PDF.)<br>

        As you will have noted if you've read this far, there are some
        pretty serious gaps in the publicly-accessible data about the
        LVDC and its software.&nbsp; If you know where to find any more
        information, please tell me about it.&nbsp; Examples of some of
        the things that would be interesting to have include:<br>

          <li>Source code, source code, source code.&nbsp; Any computer
            source code—or for that matter, binary code—that ran on the
            LVDC would be useful:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Flight software.</li>
            <li>Preflight software.</li>

        Well, we haven't made much progress on the homage
        front.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a handful of names, though too few yet
        to really form any picture as to who did what.&nbsp; Hopefully
        be able to flesh this out somewhat as time progresses and to
        provide that info here.&nbsp; A lot of the information on this
        page that doesn't come directly from the surviving documentation
        is largely due to conversations with Barry Silverman, who has
        made a significant effort to find and talk to original LVDC
        developers.<br>
