# Electrical Schematics for the AGC and DSKY

**Important Note:**  This branch ("schematics-KiCad-5") of the repository is specific to
AGC/DSKY electrical schematics and digital simulations of the electronics for version 5 of the KiCad EDA system.  It is incompatible with KiCad v6.  For versions 6 and beyond of KiCad, use the "schematics" branch of the repository instead.

## Introduction

The "schematics" branch of the Virtual AGC repository is devoted to conversion of the original hardcopies of AGC and DSKY electrical schematics into electrical CAD files, and eventually, to translation of those designs into Verilog, and the simulation thereof. We convert these schematics so that they are as close as possible to the originals, on the same size sheets, with identical title blocks and borders, with electrical components positioned and sized as close to the original as possible, but with electrical correctness in mind.

Once converted to CAD files, they can then be used for otherwise impossible things like:

- Generating netlists to see what's connected to what.
- Running ERCs (Electrical Rule Checkers) to get a little more assurance of correctness.
- Comparison of different versions of the schematics to see what has changed.
- Attractively and legibly displayed, at least in comparison to the original scans.
- More-easily used as the basis for your own AGC-like or DSKY-like designs, such as creation of circuit boards.
- Corrected (and commented) in those rare instances where the original drawings can be shown to be in error.
- Translated to Verilog.
- Used for simulation of the hardware.

## AGC and DSKY Drawings

The currently-available scans of electrical schematics associated with the AGC and DSKY can all be found on [the electro-Mechanical page the main Virtual AGC website](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ElectroMechanical.html).  Each is designated by an 8-digit part number, followed by a single-character revision code (- or A, B, C, ...).  This type of designation is retained for the CAD projects associated with the drawings.

## CAD System

Electrical schematics are drawn using the open-source [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) series of programs.  Specifically, the schematic-editor program in KiCad is called "eeschema", and we'll refer interchangably to "CAD", "KiCad", or "eeschema".  KiCad is an open-source (and free of charge) system for Linux, Mac, or Windows.

Why KiCad?  My guess is that if you are an EE &mdash; and if you aren't, why are you reading this? &mdash; then you probably object to this choice, and would prefer to use your favorite proprietary CAD system, which you happen to have a copy of it, or a free-to-download demo copy, and would argue that your professional tool is more efficient, because it lets you get things done quicker and more easily, and probably _much better_.  You are absolutely right.  But at the end of the day, this project is devoted to distributing information freely to the public, and we therefore need an open-source program, because that's the only reasonable thing we can do to try and insure that everyone can get the CAD system for free, not just today, but for the foreseeable future as well.  Make things as easy for yourself as you like, but you'll end up with material that nobody but you is ever likely to use, and if we're going to exert the effort needed to create and disseminate these materials, we can't afford to put ourselves in that situation.  If that puts you off ... sorry!

Besides that, all of KiCad's schematic files, parts libraries, board templates, and so on, are nice, ASCII files.  They can thus not only be stored nicely at GitHub, but also processed nicely with scripts, behave well when changes from different people are merged into them, and so on.

Because we retain appearances of the original drawings, as well as the sheet sizes of the original drawings &mdash; they were plotted on very big paper &mdash; we can't really avail ourselves of the standard KiCAD part libraries.  We instead have our own custom part libraries:

- AGC_DSKY.lib &mdash; contains the handful of generic parts needed: resistor, capacitor, diode, ..., in general, everything other than NOR gates.  The only tricky components are the connectors; there is a script, Script/MakeConnector.py, that can be used to create variations of the basic connector type, which can then be imported into AGC_DSKY.lib
- D3NOR-_VIN_-_GND_[-expander][-nopinnums].lib &mdash; a variety of libaries that handle the wild profusion of NOR-gate symbols needed for the schematics.  These libraries differ in the net they use for powering the NORs (namely _VIN_), the net they use for grounding the NORs' unused inputs and power supply (namely _GND_), and in whether the library contains "normal" NOR gates vs "expander" NOR gates.  Also, on most of the drawings the pin numbering is shown, but on early drawings they are not.  _VIN_ seems to always be either +4VDC, +4SW, +4SW2, FAP, or NC ("no connect"), while _GND_ is one of 0VDCA, 0VDC, or 0VDC2, so you can see that there are 5&times;3&times;2&times;2=60 overall possibilities; fortunately, _only_ about 16 of them are actually used.  :-)  There is a script, Script/MakeDualNorLib.py, that produces these libaries, given the basic parameters (_VIN_ etc.) just mentioned.

You will see these in the top-level directory of this branch.  To the extent possible, we'd like to manage changes to these libraries ourselves, rather than making their maintenance a community effort.

## Installation of KiCad

- It's best to use the nightly build of KiCad (presently v6) rather than a stable version of it (presently v4 or v5), to stay as up-to-date as possible with respect to the bug reports we file.
- KiCad global library setup: Use the main-menu function Preferences/ManageSymbolLibraries.  Select the Global Libraries tab in the window that appears.  Use the folder icon to add all of the .lib files contained in the folder to which you've cloned this repository.
- Eeschema global preferences: In KiCad, open any existing project, or create a new one, and view it in the schematic editor.  Use the main-menu function Preferences/Preferences. In the window that opens up, select Eeschma and change measurement units to inches, default text size to 140.  Select Display Options and change grid size to 25 mils, line thickness to 20 mils.

## Printing from KiCad

Printing out one of the CAD files, either to a physical printer or to an image format such as PNG or PDF, is currently somewhat trickier than it needs to be.  The basic problem is that these drawings have a much larger sheet size than KiCad has been accustomed to handle in the past, and KiCad is only slowly making the changes we need to handle this difference.  Recall, we are trying to preserve legacy drawings rather than designing new ones, so we need KiCad to accomodate us rather than adapting ourself to KiCad's limitations.  Fortunately, it has worked out pretty well so fare ... but not 100% perfectly.

Two issues presently complicate printing:

1. For dashed lines, KiCad choses its own pitch for the dashes rather than allowing us to choose it, and since KiCad's chosen pitch is only appropriate for much smaller sheet sizes, we end up with dashed lines that basically look solid.
2. For sheet sizes above a certain point, KiCad's print feature simply embeds incorrect metadata into its output files regarding the sheet size ... in fact, it makes them only a tenth the size they ought to be.

The best way I've found to get around this is to use the following basic procedure for printing:

- Use KiCad's "plot" feature rather than its "print" feature.  Plot to an output file in Postscript format.  Make sure the default line size used is 20 mils.
- Edit the Postscript file (which is just a text file) to change the styling of all dashed lines to an acceptable pitch.  What this actually involves is finding all strings of the form "[_NUMBERS_ _NUMBERS_] 0 setdash" and changing them to "[1000 1000] 0 setdash".
- Convert the Postscript to PNG using some program like GIMP, ImageMagick, or Photoshop.  The important factors, assuming you have control over them are: white background (as opposed to transparent), density units should be pixels per inch, the density should be 150 (pixels per inch), the images should be rotated to landscape.
- You can then, of course, print the PNG, convert it to PDF, or whatever pleases you.  My experience is that even the largest of the AGC drawings can be printed to 11"&times;17" and remain readable, though just barely.

The script Scripts/printKiCad.sh carries out the two middle steps (edit the dashed-line styling and convert Postscript to PNG), though it's only for Linux.  If someone wants to create comparable scripts for Mac OS X or for Windows, feel free to send it to me.  The script uses 'sed' and ImageMagick, both of which are available for both Mac OS X and Windows.

## Conventions Used in the Drawings

The original designers used various conventions and I've used various conventions in dealing with their conventions, and you may need to be aware of all of them for a full grasp of how to work with the drawings.

### Project Naming

Each of the CAD designs corresponding to one of the original drawings has a sub-directory in the Schematics/ folder, named identically to the original drawing. For example, for original drawing 2005259A (module A1), we have the folder Schematics/2005259A/.

Within that project folder, the KiCad project file is always named module.pro. Logic modules like 2005259A were implemented as pairs of circuit boards, and sometimes it is useful to have KiCad projects for the individual boards rather than for the module as a whole.  In such cases, you may find additional KiCad project files with names like board1.pro or board2.pro in the project folder as well, though at this point that has not been done for most modules.

### Organization of Drawings into Sheets

Many of the CAD designs, particularly for the "logic flow diagrams" for AGC modules A1-A24, are organized almost exactly like the original physical drawings were.  Basically, the original drawings for those modules were organized into completely electrically-independent sheets (usually 2, but occasionally 1 or 3).

In KiCad, the way to organize such a design is to create a top-level schematic that contains just 2 (or 1 or 3) blocks representing the individual sheets, plus a few wires interconnecting those blocks.  For the logic modules, A1-A24, only ground and power nets are common between the individual sheets, and hence only a few signals with names like 0VDCA or +4VDC interconnect the sheets on the top-level schematic.

### Organization of Drawings into Reusable Blocks

For modules of a more analog nature, or used for interfacing, such as AGC modules A25-A31 and B1-B17, another commonly-experienced situation is that in which the top-level drawing uses a lot of small circuit blocks that are iterated repeatedly throughout the top-level schematic. 

The overall design thus consists of a complex-looking top-level schematic, on which a number of the "components" are really circuit blocks that are themselves represented by separate schematics.  In general, each of those circuit blocks is implemented as a separate CAD sheet that acts as a template, and for each appearance of the block in the top-level schematic, the system uses the same template schematic for the circuit block but assigns different reference designators and netnames to each instance.  These CAD sheets for the circuit-block templates won't correspond exactly to a sheet of the original drawing, but will usually be just part of such an original sheet.

For example, consider an original drawing that consisted of two sheets, one of which defined the top-level design, and one of which might have defined the templates for (say) 5 circuit blocks called A, B, C, D, and E.  In the CAD design this will become 6 sheets, one for the top-level design and one for each of the A, B, C, D, and E circuit blocks.  Nevertheless, we still try to maintain as much of the visual appearances of each of these as possible, as compared to the original drawing, so that the correctness and significance of the CAD transcription is as clear as possible.  Basically, this is done by making the schematic sheets for the A, B, C, D, and E circuit blocks identical to the complete original sheet (that covered all 5 of them), but simply leaving out everything on A.sch relating to B-E, leaving out everything on B.sch that related to A and C-E, and so on.

Preservation of hierarchical reference designators is also important when working with the physical AGC circuit modules, because the physical modules have reference designators marked on them. What should the reference designators in the circuit blocks be like?  Note first that when a circuit-block appears in the top-level schematic, it is assigned a "sheet name".  For a circuit block with template C.sch, for example, those sheet names would be 1C, 2C, 3C, and so forth on the top-level schematic.  Similarly, circuit block B.sch would have sheet names 1B, 2B, etc.  These designations were drawn on the original top-level sheets, and we continue to use them as-is.  Now suppose that the components in template C.sch are R1, R2, ..., C1, C2, ....  For a particular _instance_ of C.sch appearing in the top-level schematic (say, instance sheet 3C), these reference designators become 3R1, 3R2, ..., 3C1, 3C2, ....  (You may wonder how that could work, since for example, if instance 2B of block B and 2C of block C both had an R1, then the reference designators for both would become 2R2.  The original designers took care so that there was no overlap in the reference designators in the templates for blocks A, B, C, D, and E.  Therefore, the hypothetical situation just mentioned doesn't occur.)

KiCad's schematic editor deals with this configuration well, except for the fact that the naming convention for the reference designators just mentioned is not one that its Tools/AnnotateSchematics function can apply automatically for itself.  "Annotation" is what KiCad calls the process of inventing all these unique reference designators for the instances of component parts in the circuit blocks.  We will eventually have to create a script (but don't have one yet!) that can apply this reference-designator naming for us.  Until that happens, we just have to let KiCad's Tools/AnnotateSchematics function apply some reference-designator annotation for us and live with it.

### NOR Gates

The original AGC drawings deal with NOR gates in quite a quirky manner.  

The components used were all dual 3-input NOR gates, so that each physical integrated circuit contained two NOR gates, one with inputs labeled A, B, and C, and the other with inputs labeled D, E, and F.  There are several novelties in the way the designers handled these that make them difficult to deal with in a modern CAD editor:

- The power and ground pins are hidden and are fed from global buses ... which is not unusual in itself, except that a number of different ground and power nets were used, and often several different ones were used within the same sheet.  For example, it's not unusual to find that a given sheet uses 3 different power buses (say, +4SW, +4VDC, and FAP), with no visual distinction whatever between the NOR gates using one of them and the NOR gates using another.  You have to read the textual notes on the schematic to know what's powered from what.  We handle this by having separate symbol libraries for the NOR gates for each possible combination of power and ground.  So several different NOR-gate libraries are typically used for every CAD sheet.
- The inputs to the NOR gates are ordered in whatever order seemed convenient to whoever was drafting the sheet.  For example, a NOR gate with inputs ABC might instead be shown with inputs BCA or CAB, or any other possible ordering. Moreover, the inputs which were "unused" (i.e., tied to ground) were almost always simply omitted from the drawing.  Conventionally, we represent this by using an underline to indicate an unused position on the NOR gate.  For example, if input B was tied to ground, the NOR gate might be visually represented as A\_C or perhaps as C\_A or perhaps as \_AC or perhaps as AC\_ or perhaps as ... well, you get the idea.  We handle this situation simply by having every legal combination of inputs A, B, C, D, E, F, and \_ for dual 3-input NOR gates in our NOR-gate libraries.
- On early drawings, labeling on the NOR-gate pins is completely omitted.  In other words, you'd just see 3 (or 2 or 1) pins on the schematic drawing, but no A, B, C, D, E, or F label next to them.  It's a mistake to assume (as I did at first) that that means it simply doesn't matter and that we're free to associate these pins however we like.  Rather, there's a _separate_ drawing that you have to look at to determine which pins were used and what order they appear in.  That extra drawing is called the "signal wiring diagram", and [its interpretion is discussed in some detail here](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ElectroMechanical.html#Appendix:_Signal_Wiring_Diagrams).
- NOR gates are not marked on the schematics with reference designators.  Instead, they are marked on the schematics with a unique 5-digit "gate number"; those can't be used a reference designators, because they vary by NOR gate, and not by dual-NOR chip.  There is also a 2-digit "location number", 01-60, which _is_ the same for both gates in a dual-gate chip, and which pertains to the position of the chip on the physical circuit board.  We encode these 5-digit and 2-digit numbers in the schematic symbol using fields called "Location" and "Location2", respectively.  (Yes, it would have been better as "Gate" and "Location"; too bad!)  Unfortunately, the 2-digit location number can't be used directly as a reference designator, because the same range of numbers (01-60) is generally used on the 2nd page of a 2-sheet drawing as on the 1st page, and we need reference designators to be unique across all sheets of a given drawing.  We handle this by using reference designators U1_nn_ (_nn_=01-60) on the 1st page and U2_nn_ on the 2nd.
- On early drawings, the 2-digit location number just mentioned is omitted entirely from the drawing.  However, the 2-digit number nevertheless exists and is significant, and must be maintained. Given the 5-digit gate number, the 2-digit location number is deduced from the separate signal wiring diagram, [as described here](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ElectroMechanical.html#Appendix:_Signal_Wiring_Diagrams).
- As mentioned earlier, all possible variations of pin usage of NOR gates appear in the symbol libraries.  This is not quite true, since there are a handful of instances in the original drawing in which a NOR gate with _no_ inputs appears.  I did not anticipate that kind of situation, and did not create library parts for it.  It's necessary instead to use a NOR gate that has some inputs, and to explicitly tie those inputs to ground.
- Also as mentioned earlier, producing these NOR-gate libraries is quite tricky, so there's a script, Script/MakeDualNorLib.py, to do it for you.

### Power Buses

In KiCad, in order for a symbol to have hidden power/ground pins, as the NOR gates do, it's necessary to have a net of the same name as has been assigned to the hidden power or ground pins _and_ to add a "power flag" symbol to that net.  In general, what that means is to add a library symbol which happens to be called "PWR_FLAG" to the net.  In the original AGC drawings, there is often a symbol shaped like an arrow attached to the connector pins where power and ground enter the module, so the PWR_FLAG component created for custom symbol library AGC_DSKY.lib has been made somewhat similar in appearance to such an arrow.  In spite of that initial motivation for the shape of the PWR_FLAG symbol, PWR_FLAG components are typically _not_ used on in the CAD sheets where power and ground enter the module, for reasons that will become clear in a moment.  Instead, a different symbol, an ArrowTwiddle, is used.  An ArrowTwiddle looks like a PWR_FLAG, albeit somewhat squatter, but does nothing electrically and simply supplies the appropriate visual appearance.

No ground symbol as such appears in any of the original drawings, except for a chassis-ground symbol that tends to appear once per drawing.  This chassis-ground is treated just like another component in AGC_DSKY.lib, and is not treated as one of KiCad's separate class of "power ports".  No KiCad "power port" appears in any of the CAD designs.

Finally, in a multi-sheet CAD design, the power and ground buses for the NOR-gate's hidden pins are typically the only signals that interact between sheets.  The PWR_FLAG arrow symbols mentioned earlier are not placed on the individual drawing sheets (where the similar-looking ArrowTwiddle symbols are placed instead) because if two or more PWR_FLAGS are used on a bus with the same name, KiCad's design-rule check (ERC) flags it as an error.  Instead, the power/ground signals are taken out of the sheets, onto the top-level schematic, and a single PWR_FLAG symbol is put onto each of the buses at that top level.

### Connectors

Connectors typically appear in the original drawings not as unified objects, but rather as collections of single-pin numbered oval pads.  There are a number of different connectors that fall into this category.  One of the most-common variants is the connector for AGC modules A1-29, every one of the modules has an identical connector with the following physical characteristics:

- 276 pins altogether
- Consists of 4 rows of 69 pins each
- The 69 pins are numbered 1-20 (pin 21 is omitted), 22-50 (pin 51 is missing), 52-71.

In the original drawings these connectors were treated like so:

- 266 oval-shaped, numbered pads.
- Pad numbers used:  101-171, 201-271, 301-371, and 401-471, but with 121, 221, 321, 421, 151, 251, 351, and 451 omitted.

In the CAD designs, these are treated a trifle differently:

- Four sets of 69 oval-shaped pads.
- The four sets have reference designators J1, J2, J3, and J4.
- These have the library symbol types ConnectorA1-100, ConnectorA1-200, ConnectorA1-300, and ConnectorA1-400, respectively.
- These have pin numbers (and visual marking) 101-171 (with 121 and 151 omitted), 201-271 (with 221 and 251 omitted), 301-371 (with 321 and 351 omitted), and 401-471 (with 421 and 451 omitted), respectively.
- These are "multipart" symbols, which in KiCad's terminology means that each of them consists of 71 "parts", A, B, ..., Z, AA, ..., AZ, BA, ..., BS.  The missing positions (21 and 51, corresponding to "parts" U and AY) exist in the library, but simply have no electrical pins associated with them.
- These are "DeMorgan" symbols in KiCad terminology, meaning that they have two alternate appearances (the "normal" one and the "DeMorgan" one).  In the normal appearance, the electrical pin is at either the left or right narrow end of the oval, depending on the rotation or reflection of the symbol.  In the DeMorgan appearance, the electrical pin is at either the top or bottom long end of the oval shape.
- In the original drawings, there are handful of places where an oval pad is used with pins on _both_ sides of the connectors.  This is not possible in KiCad, as far as I know, so in that case we simply draw enough extra wiring to compensate for the loss of one of the pins.
- Each _unused_ connector pad appears in the schematic, generally in a big table called "SPARE PINS", and should have a KiCad "no connect" placed on its electrical pin to avoid complaints by the automated design rule check.
- Each _used_ connector pad is accompanied by one or more visual textual captions.  These captions are the names of the backplane nets to which the connector pin will be connected if the module is plugged into the backplane, and they are important for activities such as hardware simulation.  If the schematic supports a single module &mdash; for example, drawing 2005259A supports _only_ module A1 &mdash; then there will be a single caption, and it is defined by the symbol's "Caption" field.  If the schematic supports two modules &mdash; such as the A25-A26 Interface Schematic &mdash; then there will be two captions, defined by the symbol's "Caption" and "Caption2" fields.  Which field is which is determined by the textual notes on the drawing itself.  Schematics which support 3 modules &mdash; A27-A29 Interface Schematic &mdash; have connector symbols with "Caption", "Caption2", and "Caption3" fields.

Other connector types differ in some ways, in that they may have a different number of pins or different (or no) omitted pins, but are generally described similarly.  There is a script, Script/MakeConnector.py, which can generated new connector types if necessary, following the kinds of guidelines above.  The script produces a KiCad library file containing a single multipart symbol.  Once you have that, you use the KiCad symbol-library editor's "import" feature to pull the new symbol into the AGC_DSKY.lib library.

### Other Conventional Details

Textual labels placed near wires are very seldom the KiCad construct treated as a net name, because the original drawings did not seem to use such labels electrically.  They are generally just descriptive text.

An exception is the rare case in which extra NOR gates or NOR gates with additional inputs (tied to ground) need to be added to the CAD design which were not in the original drawings.  In that case it's often desirable to add a net label for the appropriate ground bus (such as 0VDCA) to the affected input pins.

## Community Effort

It is my intention to convert every available scan of an AGC or DSKY electrical drawing (and there are over a hundred of them) to CAD. I've gotten this down to a science, so to maintain aesthetic and electrical consistency it's perhaps best that I continue that as an individual effort.  If I die or something, feel free to jump in and finish it up!

Where help _would_ be appreciated is in proof-reading the transcribed CAD files vs the scans of the original drawings.  If you would care to assist, please contact me.

## License

I am not a lawyer, but my opinion is that the MIT Instrumentation Labs drawings on which the CAD files herein are based are in the public domain.  However that fact alone does not actually restrict the licensing of the CAD files ... I think.

The controlling principle, I think, is that these CAD files are supposed to be 100% accurate reproductions of the original drawings, the act of transcribing them is not "creative" in nature, and therefore is not entitled to copyright protection  In other words, I cannot assert copyright even if I wanted to.  Therefore, it is natural if the CAD files themselves are in the public domain.  

However, the "public domain" is not a valid concept in many places outside the U.S.  Instead, the appropriate license is the CC0 (Creative Commons Zero or Public Domain) License, which is equivalent to the public domain where that concept is valid, but falls back to waiving the greatest possible number of rights.  See the file LICENSE.txt.

I, Ron Burkey, hereby assert that all KiCad CAD transcriptions provided in this repository fall under the CC0 licensed expressed by the file LICENSE.txt.
