================================================================================
HANDOFF -- ASSEMBLING THE AP-101S SOURCES WITH ASM101S  (2026-08-08)
================================================================================
Written so a fresh session can start from this file alone.  The work is in
virtualagc/ASM101S/ and ~/workspace/PFS; open the conversation at the virtualagc
root, since the assembler and this handoff are in different subtrees.

*** THIS FILE IS GENERATED.  DO NOT EDIT IT BY HAND. ***  The source is
modules/sdfpkg/dass-handoff.db and modules/sdfpkg/dass-handoff.py is how it
changes -- `list`, `show`, `search`, `set ID`, `add --after=ID`, `check`.  It
resolves its own paths, so it runs from anywhere in the tree.  Every command
that changes an entry regenerates this file; a hand edit here is invisible to
the database and the next command silently overwrites it.

THE OTHER PHASES ARE IN modules/sdfpkg/HANDOFF.md, which is four times the size
and about different work -- the PASS corpus and the DASS comparison.  You should
not need it.  The one place they touch is that document's section 12, step 1.

THE GOAL.  Advance ASM101S until it assembles the entirety of our stock of
AP-101S assembly language, correctly.  This section is the starting line: what
the stock actually is, what already works, what does not, and where the first
work is.  It was written on 2026-08-08 with the measurements below taken that
day, so they can be re-run and compared rather than believed.

THE DECISION BEHIND IT, taken by the user on 2026-08-08.  There will be TWO
assemblers, ours (virtualagc/ASM101S) and Don Schmidt's (asm101, in
nsts-sdl-dps/src/asm101), and we will use whichever proves better.  This is
deliberate and is not a fork to be reconciled: there is room for two, and the
comparison is itself informative.  The user intends to discuss it with Don and
may revise it afterwards, so treat it as the current decision rather than a
settled one.

WHAT CHANGED TO PROMPT THAT, since the previous section still says the .asm
phase is "blocked on ASM101S changes under way elsewhere".  IT IS NOT BLOCKED,
and that description was wrong in a specific way worth recording so nobody waits
on it again.  Don is not making ASM101S changes.  His last commit to
virtualagc/ASM101S is 3734237af, 2026-04-29, and he has 11 there in total, all
between February and April 2026.  He has been active in virtualagc since --
XCOM-I and HAL/S-FC as recently as 2026-08-04 -- just not in ASM101S.  There was
never a held-back patch series to wait for.

WHAT DON'S asm101 IS, so the comparison is not made from scratch again.  It is a
declared derivative of ASM101S that has been rewritten.  Every file carries
attribution -- assemble.py names ASM101S.py with its GitHub URL, and
model101tables.py says outright that it was "significantly refactored for
asm101, most of the encoding moving to instrdefs.py/instrset.py which reads
instruction descriptors from instr_defs.json".  Provenance is not in question.

At the line level almost nothing is shared.  The two totals are nearly equal --
9814 lines for ASM101S against 9755 for asm101 -- and entirely redistributed:

    parser        tatsu (PEG)          lark, with an asm.lark grammar and an AST
    CLI           argparse             typer
    layout        flat modules         a package, relative imports
    encoding      in code              data, instr_defs.json, 1613 lines
    model101.py   2362 lines           3422 lines

On a crude sorted-unique-line comparison model101.py shares about 51 lines
against roughly 1875 and 2848 unique to each side.

WHY THERE IS NO PULL REQUEST TO WAIT FOR, and why this is structural rather than
reluctance.  asm101 imports ap101Utils -- addr, addrcon, objModule, codepages,
ibmhex -- a sibling package of 10286 lines in his repository, which also holds
sdf.py, halorder.py and cards.py.  asm101 cannot be lifted into virtualagc
without it.  His most recent assembler commit makes the point better than the
import list: 5638d2e touches ap101Utils/sdf.py, ap101Utils/halorder.py,
asm101/assemble.py and asm101/model101.py in ONE commit, to make the assembler
emit .asmg.json sidecars feeding SDF generation.  That is not an assembler
improvement, it is build-pipeline integration.  The assembler has become a
component of his system rather than a standalone tool, and "merge it back" would
mean importing his infrastructure or him un-picking the assembler from it.

WHAT IS WORTH TAKING FROM IT ANYWAY.  Not the rewrite -- a handful of citable
semantic findings buried in it, which port even though the patches do not:

  - 74fb403, a null &SYSLIST(k) coerces to zero in arithmetic context, citing
    GC26-3758-3 p.19 and SC26-4940 Table 58.  It ships with tests.  This is
    language semantics and applies to any correct AP-101 assembler.
  - d983348, Z(code,data,flags) names a second target: the linkage editor
    patches the data subfield's sector into HW1's DSR through a DSR-only RLD
    (0x40) at the ZCON's position.

Both are verifiable against the IBM manuals rather than against his code, which
is the only reason they are worth having.  d983348's implementation is written
in terms of his lark front-end and does not transfer.

ONE THING asm101 IS NOT: a drop-in replacement for our RTL work.  It contains no
&ASM101S at all and only two mentions of GBLB, so the conditional-assembly idiom
every one of our gated RTL fixes depends on is absent.  Do not assume adopting
it would be a shortcut.

THE STOCK, counted on 2026-08-08.  It is in TWO places, and the second is the
one that matters.

In virtualagc, under yaShuttle/Source Code/PASS.REL32V0/ -- the RUNTIME LIBRARY:

    RUNASM/     205 .asm    the AP-101S runtime library
    ZCONASM/    284 .asm    ZCON stubs, 48-56 bytes each
    RUNMAC/      20 .asm    the macro library for those
    RUNLST/     206 .txt    contemporary listings, the reference for RUNASM

In ~/workspace/PFS, per PASS version -- FCOS, THE FLIGHT SOFTWARE ITSELF:

    OI340600/SSSRC/    225 .asm    (also 134 .hal and 17 .dfg)
    OI301700/SSSRC/    272 .asm    (also 151 .hal)
    BFS.SRC/SSSRC/       1 .asm
    <VER>/MLIB80/      278 files   the macro library these need

ZCONASM is not the work it appears to be.  Every file is four lines of the same
shape and they are mechanically generated:

    #QACOS   CSECT
     DC Z(ACOS,,X'E')
     EXTRN ACOS
     END

There are no ZCON listings anywhere, so ZCONASM can be assembled but not checked
against a contemporary reference.  Treat those 284 as volume, not difficulty.

MONITOR.ASM/ (19 files) and SDFPKG.ASM/ (7) are NOT part of this.  They are .bal
-- IBM 360 Basic Assembler Language for the HAL/S-FC compiler itself -- a
different target and a different assembler.

THE .dfg FILES SIT IN SSSRC TOO, 17 of them in OI340600.  They are the other
phase, still blocked for want of a preprocessor; do not be surprised to meet
them here.

HOW TO MEASURE WHERE YOU ARE.  ASM101S/regressionASM101S.sh assembles all 205
RUNASM files and compares each against its RUNLST listing.  It takes minutes,
not hours, and is the loop to work in:

    cd ASM101S && ./regressionASM101S.sh              # our fixes ON, the default
    cd ASM101S && ./regressionASM101S.sh --no-rtl-fixes
    cd ASM101S && ./regressionASM101S.sh --copy       # keep each listing as .lst

It prints each module name, and prints the last line of the assembly only when
that line is NOT "0 bytes mismatched and 0 bytes missing".  So a run where every
name appears and nothing else does is a clean run, and any other text is a
finding.  Redirect through `sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'` to strip its colours.

*** READ THE RESULT WITH --no-rtl-fixes IN MIND. ***  RUNLST is HISTORICAL, and
our RTL fixes deliberately depart from it.  They live behind &ASM101S gates in
the .asm sources, &ASM101S is true by default, and cb63663cd added
--no-rtl-fixes to force it false so a build can reproduce the historical image
including its bugs.  A file carrying a gated fix therefore MUST differ from its
listing on a default run.  Comparing the two runs is what separates "our fix"
from "our defect": --no-rtl-fixes measures the assembler alone, the default run
measures the assembler plus our intentional deviations.

A single file, which is how you will actually iterate:

    cd "yaShuttle/Source Code/PASS.REL32V0/RUNASM"
    ASM101S --library --tolerable=4 --compare=../RUNLST/NAME.txt NAME.asm

ASM101S is a two-line wrapper on $PATH at ASM101S/ASM101S and runs ASM101S.py.
--library loads the default macro library (RUNMAC); without it no macros are
loaded at all and nothing in RUNASM will assemble.  --tolerable=4 accepts MNOTE
severities up to 4, which the sources use for information messages.

To deploy a hand-assembled object into Don's build tree, which is a separate
matter and covered in the memory on &ASM101S-gated fixes, add --object=NAME.obj
and copy the result; do NOT run `make runtime` there expecting it to preserve
gated fixes, because asm101 does not implement them.

HOW TO ASSEMBLE FCOS, which is not the same command as the runtime library.  Run
it from the VERSION directory, not from SSSRC, and point --library at MLIB80
rather than the default RUNMAC:

    cd ~/workspace/PFS/OI340600
    ASM101S --library=MLIB80 --force-d SSSRC/FPMSWTCH.asm

*** --object= MUST END IN .obj. ***  ASM101S rejects any other name before it
assembles a line, and it says so in one line on stderr.  A sweep that hands it
mktemp names therefore fails on every module identically, with empty output and
a uniform exit status -- which looks exactly like a real measurement of a
thoroughly broken assembler.  That happened on 2026-08-08 and produced a
confident 497-of-497 failure table that meant nothing.  If a sweep reports every
module failing the same way, suspect the harness before the assembler.

USE --trace.  It was added for precisely this problem and prints each macro
invocation as it is entered, with its &SYSLIST, indented by nesting depth:

    Trace:  AMAIN []
    Trace:      WORKAREA []
    Trace:  INPUT ['F0']

That is how the root cause below was found, and it is the only practical way to
see what a nested expansion is actually receiving.

THE MACRO-PROCESSING ROOT CAUSE IS FIXED, issue #1331, in commit 0f5ab2939 on
2026-08-08.  The issue itself is worth reading anyway -- it is the user's own
analysis plus two outside contributors, and it is where the semantics below are
justified from the manuals.  What follows is what the fix established, so that
nobody re-derives it.

A MACRO ARGUMENT IS A CHARACTER STRING, except where the source wrapped it in
parentheses, in which case it is a SUBLIST passed through verbatim and
subscriptable to any depth:

    RON 1,(10,(100,200,300),30),3

    &SYSLIST(2)      (10,(100,200,300),30)     the source text, parens and all
    &SYSLIST(2,2)    (100,200,300)
    &SYSLIST(2,2,3)  300
    &SYSLIST(2,9)    null                      past the end is not an error
    &SYSLIST(1,1)    1                         a non-sublist is a sublist of one

ASM101S flattened one level and never recursed, so the second operand arrived as
the unusable (10,((,(100,((,,200),(,,300))),)),30), and &SYSLIST(n,m) did not
exist at all.  MLIB80 uses multilevel subscripts heavily -- 16 of &SYSLIST(&I,2)
alone, and &SYSLIST(&I,2,&J) at three levels -- which is why most of FCOS could
not assemble.  RUNMAC uses NONE of it, which is why RUNASM's 205 of 205 never
noticed.

MULTILEVEL SUBLISTS ARE PERIOD-CORRECT and not an AP-101S invention.  They are
an Assembler H feature, GC26-3758-3 (January 1974) p.13; the Assembler F manual
of 1967 describes a different assembler and has nothing to say about them, which
is why looking there came up empty.  The same rules survive as Tables 48 and 49
of the HLASM Language Reference, SC26-4940.

COUNTING.  N' is the number of entries, and an omitted entry still counts, so
N'(A,,C) and N'(A,B,) are both 3.  N'() is 1, the null string being its single
entry, and N' of a non-sublist is 1.  K' is the width of the argument's text.

ARITHMETIC CONTEXT HAS EXACTLY THREE CASES, GC26-3758-3 p.19 and SC26-4940
Table 58: null is zero, a valid self-defining term is its value, and anything
else -- a sublist, a symbol -- is a program error to DIAGNOSE.  It is not
coerced.  The old TypeError at expressions.py:521 was reporting a real defect
upstream of itself; making that comparison succeed would have converted a loud
failure into a wrong assembly, and the fix went upstream instead.

COLLATION was already right and is worth not re-opening: character relations
compare in EBCDIC, and of two values of unequal length the shorter is always the
lesser (SC26-4940 p.388).  macroTests/sublists.asm pins both down with two
comparisons that invert under ASCII.

A SEPARATE DEFECT WAS FIXED IN THE SAME COMMIT because the first fix made it
reachable.  A SETA/SETB/SETC whose operand carried a trailing comment --

    &MSGCNT  SETA  &MSGCNT+1        ARRAY INDEX=INDEX+1

-- failed to parse, and svSet then returned WITHOUT ASSIGNING, so the variable
silently kept its old value.  In MACSMITH's RTURNTBL that left the loop bound
&STOP at zero while &A counted up from 1, and the assembly never terminated.
These operands now end at the first blank outside a quoted string, as the
instruction grammars already did.  This is the shape to watch for: a silently
skipped assignment shows up much later as a non-terminating loop.

THE OTHER OPEN ISSUE IS #1333, a feature request for the ORG pseudo-op, from an
outside user assembling compiler-generated code.  It also carries a second,
separable defect: "ST#1 EQU *" crashes with KeyError None at model101.py:1237.
The remaining ASM101S issues -- 1317, 1320, 1324 through 1329, 1332, 1271 -- are
all CLOSED and are useful mainly as worked examples of how such a defect gets
pinned down.

THE BASELINE.  It has two halves and they are nothing alike.  The RUNASM numbers
were re-measured on 2026-08-08 after the issue #1331 fix; the FCOS numbers are
that fix's output on the same day.

THE RUNTIME LIBRARY IS FINISHED.  ASM101S assembles all of it, and RUNASM is
verified rather than merely error-free:

    RUNASM    205 of 205   assemble AND match their contemporary listings byte
                           for byte under --no-rtl-fixes: "0 bytes mismatched
                           and 0 bytes missing", every module
    ZCONASM   284 of 284   assemble.  No listings exist, so this is the weaker
                           claim of the two

On a default run exactly six RUNASM files fail, and those six are precisely the
six containing &ASM101S -- CINDEX, MM14SN, MM6SN, MV6SN, VV6S3 and VX6S3.  Their
gated fixes change the generated code and the historical listing does not have
it, so the comparison must fail.  None of that is an assembler defect.  Establish
that set with `grep -l ASM101S RUNASM/*.asm`, not from memory: a first pass on
the day recalled five of them and wrote CINDEX up as an unexplained sixth.

RUNASM IS A WEAK GUARD ON MACRO PROCESSING, which is easy to mistake for a
strong one.  RUNMAC uses no multilevel sublists at all, so the whole of that
machinery can be broken while the score stays at 205 of 205.  Run
ASM101S/macroTests/regressionMacros.sh as well; it takes seconds and it is the
only check that covers the conditional-assembly language itself.

FCOS IS WHERE THE WORK IS.  Of OI340600's 225 modules, assembled against MLIB80,
before and after the #1331 fix:

                    before   after
    OK                  21      21
    ERRORS              33      38
    CRASH              170     155
    HANG                 1      11

No module regressed, and the two dominant crash signatures are gone entirely --
91 TypeError at expressions.py:521 and 16 NameError at :570.  The survivors
mostly did not stop failing, they got further before failing, which is why CRASH
fell by only 15 while the histogram was redrawn:

     85  TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType'       model101.py:1735
     39  KeyError: 'ast'                              model101.py:2207
     17  IndexError: bytearray index out of range     model101.py:1527
     11  TypeError: unsupported operand &, float/int
      1  KeyError: 'preliminaryOffset'                model101.py:1243
      1  KeyError: None                               model101.py:1243
      1  KeyError: 'ICCLGTH'

READ "HANG" AS "EXCEEDED THE TIMEOUT", not as "looping".  All 11 are modules
that previously crashed early and now run much further; the count went as high
as 38 before the trailing-comment defect described above was fixed.  DCICYC was
checked individually and is making steady progress, its &SYSNDX climbing 401 ->
829 -> 1086 over 90s, so it is slow rather than stuck.  The others were not
checked individually.  That distinction is cheap to make and worth making before
treating one as a defect: run it with --trace and watch whether the &SYSNDX in
column 2 keeps rising.  A frozen &SYSNDX with the trace still scrolling is a
conditional-assembly loop; a rising one is just work.

OI301700 COULD NOT BE MEASURED AT ALL, and the reason is not the assembler.  Its
MLIB80 holds 41 files against OI340600's 278, and NOT ONE of them is a macro
definition -- every core macro the sources use, PROGRAM, IF, DO, PROC, EQUATE,
IFPROC among 237 others, is simply absent.  It also has no MACROFILES.txt, so
ASM101S stops immediately with "Cannot open ../MLIB80/MACROFILES.txt".  The user
confirmed on the day that OI301700 needs files borrowed from OI340600 and that
this has never yet been done.  Until it is, every OI301700 number is vacuous.

DO NOT "FIX" THIS BY GENERATING MACROFILES.txt THERE.  It was tried on the day.
makeMACROFILES.py runs happily and produces an index naming ZERO macro files,
because there are none to name, and ASM101S then loads no macros at all and
buries you in errors instead of stopping with one clear message.  Borrow the
macros first.

THERE IS A SECOND SOURCE FOR OI301700, pointed out by the user on 2026-08-08:
~/workspace/PFS/"OI301700 as received"/ holds the FCOS assembly-language files
as assembly LISTINGS, showing the assembled form rather than the source as such.
That is original-build primary evidence, so it is the reference to check a
borrowed macro library against, in the same way RUNLST is the reference for
RUNASM.  It has not been used yet.

NEXT STEPS, in order.  Step 1 of the previous list -- fix macro keyword and
sublist handling, issue #1331 -- was done on 2026-08-08 in commit 0f5ab2939 and
the numbers above are the result.  What follows is what it left.

  1. THE NoneType CRASH AT model101.py:1735 IS NOW THE WHOLE JOB, 85 of the 155
     remaining crashes and up from 5 before, because so many modules now reach
     it.  Nothing else comes close, and it is the same shape of win the last
     step was.  Take one of the 85 and work it the same way: reproduce, run with
     --trace, and find where the None was produced rather than where it was
     dereferenced.

  2. RE-RUN THE SWEEP AND SEE WHAT IS LEFT.  modules/sdfpkg/fcos-sweep.sh does
     all 225 and classifies each as OK/ERRORS/CRASH/HANG; it now runs every
     module under `timeout`, overridable with FCOS_TIMEOUT, which defaults to
     120s.  The table above is its output for 2026-08-08 and is the thing to
     beat.  Expect the histogram to be redrawn again rather than merely
     shortened, so do not plan past this point in detail.

  3. BORROW OI301700'S MACRO LIBRARY FROM OI340600, ~237 files, then sweep it.
     The user has never done this, so treat it as unexplored: the two versions
     are years apart and a macro that merely has the same name may not have the
     same definition.  Diff a few that DO exist in both before assuming the rest
     can be copied wholesale.  Check the result against the listings in
     ~/workspace/PFS/"OI301700 as received"/ described above, which are primary
     evidence of what the original build actually produced.  Expect to justify
     the choice later, since the corpus goal covers both PASS versions.

  4. THE 11 REMAINING HANGS, but measure before assuming.  Read the note above
     on telling a slow module from a looping one by watching &SYSNDX under
     --trace; only the looping ones are defects.  FIOADCNS, which was the single
     hang before and blocked a whole sweep, now terminates and reports ERRORS.

  5. THE SMALLER, SEPARABLE ONES.  ORG is unimplemented and is a standing
     feature request from an outside user (#1333), which also carries a
     KeyError-None crash on "ST#1 EQU *" at model101.py:1237.  DC cannot parse a
     hex literal with comma-separated groups, as in
     DC X'A92F0A3C,A2DFA000,0000A35B,A35DA5B2' -- that alone is all 328 of
     FAZ2's diagnosed errors.  ASM101S.py:1144 raises IndexError when generated
     code runs past the end of a --compare listing, instead of reporting it;
     that is what makes the six intentional RUNASM deviations look like crashes
     on a default regression run.  And free-standing "*" comment lines between
     macro definitions confuse the MACRO/MEND block tracking, so the definitions
     leak into code generation and die with AttributeError on a None operand at
     model101.py:984; this was found while writing macroTests/sublists.asm and
     is why that file keeps its prose in the "*/" header instead.
