# E/BKCALL	FOR DOING BANKCALLS FROM AND RETURNING TO ERASABLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE IS CALLABLE FROM ERASABLE OR FIXED.  LIKE BANKCALL, HOWEVER, SWITCHING BETWEEN S3 AND S4
# IS NOT POSSIBLE.
#
# THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS:
#
#	TC	BANKCALL
#	CADR	E/BKCALL
#	CADR	ROUTINE		# WHERE TO WANT TO GO IN FIXED.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY TERMINATE, BAD STALL OR TC Q.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY PROCEED OR GOOD RETURN FROM STALL.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY ENTER OR RECYCLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE REQUIRES TWO ERASABLES (EBUF2, +1) IN UNSWITCHED WHICH ARE UNSHARED BY INTERRUPTS AND
# OTHER EMEMORY PROGRAMS.
#
# A + L ARE PRESERVED THROUGH BANKCALL AND E/BKCALL.

E/BKCALL	DXCH	BUF2		# SAVE A,L AND GET DP RETURN.

		MASK	LOW10		# GET CURRENT EBANK.  (SBANK SOMEDAY)
		ADS	EBUF2	+1	# FORM BBCON.  (WAS FBANK)
		NDX	EBUF2
		CA	0 -1		# GET CADR OF ROUTINE.
		TC	SWCALL		# GO TO ROUTINE, SETTING Q TO SWRETURN
					# AND RESTORING A + L.
		TC	+4		# TX Q, V34, OR BADD STALL RETURN.
		TC	+2		# PROCEED OR GOOD STALL RETURN.
