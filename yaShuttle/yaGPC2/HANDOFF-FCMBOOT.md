# HANDOFF — FCMBOOT → GPCIPL → MEDS

Written to survive a `/compact`. Everything needed to resume is here; the
long-form narrative is in `CLAUDE_LOG.md` (entries dated 2026-08-24 and
2026-08-25) and should be read for *why*, not *what*.

---

## 1. The goal

Boot the real Shuttle IPL chain in yaGPC2, end to end:

    firmware IPL → FCMBOOT (bootstrap) → reads GPCIPL off the mass memory
                 → hands control to GPCIPL → GPCIPL drives the MEDS display

PASS User's Guide (`~/Desktop/sandroid.org/public_html/apollo/Shuttle/PASS
USER GUIDE - OI32.pdf`) §2.3 and Table 2-2 (pages 49, 52, 53) describe the
sequence. Key facts established from it:

- **HALT** = hardware RESET held; no software runs. **STBY entered from
  HALT** releases reset and gives control to the Bootstrap Loader. The
  mode switch is a reset line, not a polled input — FCMBOOT never tests
  those bits.
- Table 2-2 step 10 (GPC IPL push/release) is the *firmware* IPL: it
  fills memory (C9FB 0-1FFFF, C6C6 20000-7FFFF) and reads the bootstrap
  in from the MMU. We do not emulate that microcode; `--ipl` stands in
  for the fill, and we load FCMBOOT from a file instead of from tape.

---

## 2. WHERE IT STANDS RIGHT NOW

**FCMBOOT loads GPCIPL and hands control to it.** Fixed 2026-08-25 in
`14a7b7581`. All five of phase 10's load blocks now match the tape
halfword for halfword (27,292 halfwords, none wrong), all five checksum
on the first attempt, and `LPS X'0014'` at 0x30239 loads `013F 0011` —
the vector off the tape — putting the machine at 0x0013F with BSR=DSR=1,
which is GPCIPL's `SRESINTN`. GPCIPL then runs.

What was wrong (the long form is in `CLAUDE_LOG.md`, 2026-08-25):
FCMBOOT skips the unread tail of a partial mass memory block by
*delaying* over it (`#DLYI`, `2*(639 - partial)` counts, built at
FCMBBLDR+0x25). The model queued whole transfers and never lost a word,
so the delay skipped nothing and every load block after the first landed
477–610 halfwords early. The same displacement had a second halfword in
it: a delay leaves one stale word latched in the MIA, which FCMBOOT
discards with a one-halfword `#RDLI` it labels "CLEAR THE MIA BUFFER"
(FCMBBLDR+0x18) — with nothing latched, that ate a live word. Now
`mmumodel.c` puts a word on the bus at its own word time with 256 word
times of gap between blocks, and `iop_bce_delay` throws away what goes
past while it runs, leaving the last one in the MIA.

Two things from the previous version of this section were simply wrong
and are recorded here so they are not re-derived:

- The "checksum pass and fail both hit" contradiction was not one.
  `FCMBCKSM` exits the whole loop on the first mismatch (0x034E, then
  `B #@LB74`), so one call hits 0x30352 once per *passing* block and
  0x3034E at most once. Both firing is the ordinary shape of "blocks
  1..n-1 passed, block n failed".
- The PSA zeros seen at the LPS came from a later, worse retry, not from
  the first load. LB1 was always byte-perfect, PSA included.

### The open thread — START HERE

GPCIPL runs but takes **unrecognized SVCs** and loops. `halucp`'s HAL/S
SVC intercept is firing on GPCIPL's own assembly SVCs and passing them
through to the real interrupt:

    SVC DEBUG: ea=0x0 R1=0xff0e0000 NIA=0x1b57 mem[ea]=0x0000
    HAL/S SVC unrecognized, passing to real interrupt

Sites seen: 0x1153 (ea=0x80ce), 0x1B57, 0x1CDA, 0x2DED (ea=0x76). An
`ea` of 0 with a code of 0 says the effective address is not being formed
the way GPCIPL means it — likely the same expanded/unexpanded confusion
that MVH had. Start by reading GPCIPL's own source at those addresses.

## 3. HOW TO RUN THINGS

Paths (scratchpad, session-specific — recreate if gone, see §5):

    SP=/tmp/claude-1000/-mnt-STORAGE-home-rburkey-git-virtualagc-yaShuttle-yaGPC2/187b3ac5-a4ae-459c-9827-61f2ad3aa645/scratchpad

| artifact | path | what |
|---|---|---|
| FCMBOOT image, stamped | `$SP/boot/BOOT-stamped.fcm` | PHASE01 + IPL phase table. **Use this one.** |
| FCMBOOT image, raw | `$SP/boot/real/BOOT.fcm` | before stamping |
| its symbols | `$SP/boot/real/BOOT.sym.json` | FCMPTAD1/2/3 = 894/1150/1406 |
| FCMBOOT listing | `$SP/boot/real/FCMBOOT.log` | ASM101S listing — **the reference for addresses** |
| tape | `$SP/tape/mmu2.mmv` | 1085 blocks, GPCIPL at 2/4/3/0 |
| composed IPL image | `$SP/donroute/IPL/IPL.fcm` | 1 MB, 6 bytes from Don's reference |
| phase libs (25) | `$SP/phase_build/OI340600/PHASEnn.lib` | **top level**; sym.json is in `PHASEnn/` |

**The canonical run** (deterministic, no sockets):

    ./yaGPC2 run --ipl --mmu-model $SP/tape/mmu2.mmv --deu-model \
        --max-steps 40000000 $SP/boot/BOOT-stamped.fcm

Add `--break <hexaddr>`, `--watch <hexaddr>`, `--verbose` (register dump at
stop), `--trace` (~100 bytes/step), or `--debug` with commands piped on
stdin: `printf 'b 0x30239\nc\nr\nx 0x14 4\nq\n' | ./yaGPC2 run ...`

Env traces: `YAGPC_INTTRACE=1` (interrupt dispatches — invaluable),
`YAGPC_MMUTRACE=1`, `YAGPC_DISCRETETRACE=1`, `YAGPC_CLKTRACE=1`.

### Addresses you will need

FCMBOOT relocates itself to **sector 6**, so its runtime addresses are
`0x30000 + offset`. Breakpoints take the **full** address (0x30239), but
the hit message prints only 4 hex digits ("breakpoint at 0x0239").

| addr | what |
|---|---|
| 0x0014 | PSA system-reset vector; FCMBOOT's own = 014B → FCMBMOVR |
| 0x0004 | PSA power-on vector; FCMBOOT parks here (wait-state bit) — **`--power-on` is wrong for FCMBOOT, use `--ipl`** |
| 0x3014B | FCMBMOVR, where `--ipl` starts it |
| 0x30180 | FCMBSTRT, after relocation to sector 6 |
| 0x30199 | FCMBSSM2 "NO MASS MEMORY" wait |
| 0x3019d | "SAVE THE BCE NUMBER" — a mass memory was selected |
| 0x3021E | FCMBSSM3, "tried all three areas" give-up wait |
| 0x3023E | `@SIO` — starts the MSC, i.e. talks to the MMU |
| 0x30332 | checksum loop entry (R6 = LBs left) |
| 0x3034E | `ZH FCMBGRD` — checksum FAILED |
| 0x30352 | checksum PASSED |
| 0x30239 | `LPS X'0014'` — the handover. Loads 013F/0011 → GPCIPL. |
| 0x0013F | GPCIPL `SRESINTN`, where control lands (BSR=DSR=1) |

Useful when the load itself is in doubt: dump memory at the checksum
entry (`b 0x30330; c; x 0x0000 32768`) and compare it against the tape
blocks directly, rather than reading dumps by eye. The tape's stream for
phase 10 is 55 blocks from 2/4/3/0, i.e. `.mmv` block index
`((4*8+2)*8+3)*32 = 8800`, and the load blocks take it in order with each
partial block's tail discarded. Getting this wrong by eye is what
produced the retracted "holes" and "PSA did not load" claims.

Phase 10's five load blocks (start, length, protected):

    0x00000 15394 1   0x03C22 9632 1   0x06DC0 502 0
    0x06FBC   994 1   0x07C00  770 1

## 4. TOOLS BUILT THIS WEEK (all committed, all ours)

- **`src/mmumodel.c/.h` + `--mmu-model <vol>` / `--mmu-unit <n>`** —
  in-process mass memory, ported from `mmu.coffee`/`mmuConf.coffee`/
  `volume.coffee`. Reads real `.mmv` files. Answers synchronously; no
  socket, no drops, no pacing. **Takes one bus only** and composes with
  `--bce-network` and `--deu-model` via `bus_router_service()` in run.c.
  This is what made the work reproducible — the networked runs disagreed
  with themselves and `--trace`/`--debug`/`--verbose` each changed the
  outcome. The user explicitly wants non-UI peripherals built in like
  this; MEDS stays external because it has a GUI worth having.
- **`tools/stamp_ipl_phase_table.py`** — builds FCMBOOT's IPL phase table
  and stamps it into FCMPTAD1/2/3. Nothing in the toolchain generates it
  (checked twice: `--stamp-phase-tables` covers #PFCMGPT/#PCDCPHA/
  FCMG3DAT, and mmubuild's DMMD pass names only SMARDD2A/SMARDD4A).
  Layout: four 3-hw phase descriptors (phases 10, 2, 13, 3), then 3-hw
  load-block descriptors, from `mmbstamp.LoadBlock.words()`.
  **Assumption, flagged: contiguous layout in that order.** Never verified
  against an original stamped table.
- **`tools/build_ipl_fcm.sh`** — rewritten to Don's composition route
  (relink with current lnk101, then `mmu2fcm --config IPL --phases 10
  --stamp-checksums`). Needs PHASE02.lib present. Output is 6 bytes from
  Don's reference IPL.fcm (the two unrelocated FIOMUWB2 constants).
- **`yaShuttle/discretePanel/`** (pushed): `discretes.py`,
  `discretePanel.py` (Tk), `discreteMonitor.py`. Wire format: multicast
  239.255.1.1:6980, four 16-bit words — op (SET=1/RESET=2), register
  (A=1/B=2), 32-bit mask in two halves, IBM bit numbering.

Emulator fixes made (all with POO citations, all committed):
- **MVH** wrote back the *expanded* address, overflowing and destroying
  the sector bit. gpc has the identical bug, unfixed upstream.
- **tick_counter** carried the timer borrow into the PSA high halfword
  unconditionally; the POO says a *masked* interrupt must not.
- **Instruction Monitor / MODE switch / discretes** — see CLAUDE_LOG.

## 5. TRAPS THAT COST REAL TIME — DO NOT REPEAT

1. **A breakpoint hit is not proof.** `0x4713` "proved" GPCIPL got
   control; the trace showed `004713: 0000  A 0,X'0000'(0)` — a runaway
   sliding through zeros traverses every address. **Check the instruction
   at the breakpoint.** I reported success on this and had to retract it.
2. **`timeout N cmd | grep` loses ALL output** when the timeout fires.
   Redirect to a file. (Done this four times.)
3. **The Bash tool's own default timeout is 2 minutes** regardless of the
   `timeout` given to the shell. Raise the tool timeout for long runs.
4. **Tool output is not reliably shown to the user.** Paste anything they
   must read into the reply itself.
5. **`mmu get`/`dump` take slash addresses** (`2/4/3/0`), not the ALLOC
   card form (`42300`) — the latter silently reads blank tape.
6. **Probe instruction *starts***, taken from the listing. 0x1c0 is the
   second halfword of the instruction at 0x1bf and never hits.
7. **A "wait state" stop exits 0 and prints nothing** without `--verbose`.
   Silence is a result, not a failure to run.

## 6. OUTSTANDING, NOT CODE

- **13 commits unpushed** on `master` (`e7417f9c8` … `14a7b7581`). The
  user pushes themselves; they asked not to push until things were tested.
- **`make test` has four failures that are NOT ours** — `test_debugger.sh`,
  `test_cpu_instr_exec`, `test_iop_bce_exec`, `test_iop_msc_exec` fail
  identically with the working tree stashed. Checked 2026-08-25; worth
  fixing on their own account, and worth re-checking against a stash
  before blaming any new change for them.
- **Unverified in the pacing fix:** `iop_bce_delay` discards on every bus,
  not just the mass memory. That is right for hardware — a delay always
  loses bus data — but nothing in the suite exercises `#DLYI` on the DK
  bus, so a regression in the DEU/MEDS path would not have shown up.
- **MVH bug report to Don — drafted-but-held.** The user asked to wait.
  gpc still has it (`cpu_instr.coffee:5461`,
  `t.r(v.x).set32((destAddr << 16) | 0)`); JS bitwise is 32-bit so the
  same overflow applies. **Show the text before posting.**
- **Issue #30** (github.com/ColanderCombo/nsts-sim-gpc/issues/30) is open,
  asking Don for discretes; the PR is offered but explicitly withheld
  unless he asks. Branch `yagpc2-discretes` in `~/donschmidt/nsts-sim-gpc`
  is ready to become it (rebased on origin/main, 25/25 tests).
- **Issue #27** comment posted (CVFX; his call left standing).
- Repos as of now: `nsts-sdl-dps` master @ `b14293b`;
  `nsts-sim-gpc` on `yagpc2-discretes` @ `cb6b28d`. The user asks for a
  repo check first thing each session — Don is committing frequently and
  **read the commit comments**, they are substantive.

## 7. STANDING RULES (from CLAUDE.md / the user)

- **Never edit an existing `*.md`** without the phrase "Full Documentation
  Sync". Appending to `CLAUDE_LOG.md` and writing `HANDOFF*`/`RELAY-*` is
  always allowed.
- **Commit finished, verified work** without being asked. Don't commit
  unverified work.
- **Show outward-facing text before it is sent** — PR/issue prose gets
  reviewed first.
- **Use ASM101S.py / HALSFC, never `asm101` or `halsc`** for builds.
  `asm101` is a reimplementation; `halsc` is a wrapper whose API differs,
  so neither can underpin user-facing instructions.
- `~/workspace/PFS` and `~/donschmidt/*` are other people's repos: pull
  before changing, prefer read-only, say what was touched. (Everything on
  local branches in nsts-sdl-dps is ours.)
- Measure, don't recall. Re-run rather than quoting an old number.
