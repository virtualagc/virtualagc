                able to update the index pages for those boxes (or the

                  Internet Archive site</a> and in the "Search this

                508", or ...).&nbsp; Of course, some of the rescans are
                <i>still</i> illegible, when the microfilm itself is out
                of focus or has some other problem, but for the most

            the intervening Holidays and various other coincidental

            addressed yet at NARA.&nbsp; Well, it'll be fixed when it
            will be fixed, and for now we'll have what we'll have.&nbsp;
            In the interim, I'm hoping to go back and scan (with a
            different, slower scanner) the drawings which proved
            partially or completely illegible on the first
            attempt.&nbsp; That's about 400 scans.&nbsp; But again,

                I suppose this reorganization doesn't need any serious
                justification ... nevertheless, it was done because I
                now recognize the need to eventually rescan a fairly
                significant number of LEM aperture cards whose initial
                scans are not legible enough.&nbsp; The new

                engineering-drawing scans like the one for the G&amp;N
                scans — simply because the search database would be too
                big to reasonably load into a browser with the current
                situation <i>vis-</i><i>à</i><i>-vis</i> network
                bandwidth, computer memory, and so on — I've belatedly
                realized that there's no reason I can't provide such an
                index as a non-browser file that you can explicitly
                download, load into a spreadsheet, etc.&nbsp; So I've
                added a <a href="LemDrawingIndex.tsv">master LEM
                  engineering-drawing index file</a>.&nbsp; I expect
                this file will eventually exceed 60MB in size — which
                should give you some idea why I don't think you'd want
                to load it into your browser — though right now it's in
                the neighborhood of just 2MB.&nbsp; Since the project of

          <td valign="top">With the completion of scans of the MIT
            G&amp;N System engineering drawings last week, scanning of
            GAEC (Grumman) LM engineering drawings has now
            commenced.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            I've had second thoughts about my earlier comments, wherein
            I said that I wouldn't bother to index any of the LM
            drawings, and have decided to go ahead and provide a
            dedicated index page for each box of LM drawings.&nbsp;
            Nevertheless, for technical reasons it's <i>still</i> the
            case that I don't intend to add any of these LM drawings to
            the master engineering search engine or to provide assembly
            drilldowns.&nbsp; So the drawings will still be a trifle
            trickier to access than the G&amp;N drawings in some
            cases.&nbsp; At any rate, the first couple of boxes are now
            available, namely <a href="LemDrawingIndexBox502.html">Box
              502</a> and <a href="LemDrawingIndexBox503.html">Box 503</a>.&nbsp;





















            We won't be reaching the drawing-number range containing the
            top-level drawings for the LM until boxes 518 through 528,
            though, which hopefully will happen sometime in January
            2020, depending on the breaks.&nbsp; Due to the fact that
            the metadata for the LM drawings is completely different in
            form from the metadata I was working with for the G&amp;N
            system, the process of creating these indices is very much a
            work in progress that will undoubtedly experience a few
            initial hiccups.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Unfortunately,</i> the drawing metadata (drawing number,
            revision code, etc.) on which the box-index pages are
            necessarily based turns out to be incorrect much more often
            than I've been accustomed to in the earlier (G&amp;N system)
            scans.&nbsp; There are dozens of such errors in boxes 502
            and 503 alone.&nbsp; The usual error is an incorrect drawing
            number.&nbsp; Thus it is often the case that due to being
            mislabeled, a drawing may not only be in the wrong position
            in the index table for any given box, but may even be in the
            wrong box entirely.&nbsp; I've made an attempt at correcting
            these, but given the vast number of scans involved, there's
            just no way I can do it whilst still performing scans of
            additional boxes.&nbsp; In other words, I had to give up
            pretty quickly.&nbsp; Perhaps they can be corrected in the
            future ... perhaps by someone much more interested in the
            LEM drawings than I personally am.&nbsp; (Hint!)&nbsp; But
            don't hold your breath waiting for me to do more than a
            handful of them myself.<br>
            <br>
            Possibly even worse, the aperture-card punch-data doesn't
            list any of the drawing titles at all, not even the
            abbreviated titles as the G&amp;N punch-card metadata
            did.&nbsp; So at present, all (or almost all) drawing titles
            are simply listed as blank.&nbsp; Over the course of time,
            perhaps, those drawing titles can be manually added to the
            index pages.&nbsp; (Again, hint!&nbsp; Hint!!)&nbsp; As a
            rule of thumb, I'd say that any entries having a non-blank
            title in the index have also been double-checked or correct
            insofar as their other metadata.<br>

            boxes 431-477 are the entirety of the Apollo G&amp;N System
            engineering drawings stored at the National Archives
            Southwest branch in Forth Worth, Texas, and thus I've now
            scanned <i>all</i> available CM/LM G&amp;N drawings.&nbsp;
            As far as we know.&nbsp; There's always the possibility of
            aperture-cards being stashed in the <i>wrong</i> boxes and
            therefore remaining undiscovered — indeed, I found a dozen
            or so such drawings today — but admittedly, it may be a very
            long time (if ever) before such misplaced drawings are
            revealed.&nbsp; In other words, I wouldn't hold my
            breath!&nbsp; At any rate, the grand total so far is about
            90K scans of about 12K unique drawing numbers.<br>
            <br>
            That doesn't mean the work on these G&amp;N drawings has
            finished.&nbsp; Many of the indices for the boxes still need
            to have their drawing titles corrected to agree with the
            drawings' title blocks (as opposed to the aperture cards'
            punched metadata), and many assemblies represented by the
            drawings still need to have their bill-of-material
            information digitized to allow accurate assembly drilldowns;
            plus, those electrical drawings being transcribed to CAD
            still need transcription.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the initial
            work of physically scanning the drawings has finished, and
            the remaining work on them can proceed without regard to
            physical access to the archives.<br>
            <br>
            It also doesn't mean that scanning is complete,
            either.&nbsp; While scanning of guidance &amp; navigation
            drawings has finished, many additional (non-G&amp;N)
            unscanned boxes of aperture cards remain.&nbsp; The next
            step is to scan Grumman's LM engineering drawings, boxes
            241-333 and 502-688.&nbsp; A quick calculation shows that
            there are 280 LM boxes (over 500K scans) vs the 47 G&amp;N
            boxes (90K scans) ... so it may take quite a while.&nbsp;
            There are additionally many hundreds of North American CSM
            boxes, but I'm not currently planning to scan any of those
            personally; I have reason to believe they may <i>eventually</i>
            become available via other mechanisms without any
            intervention be me (thank goodness!), but "eventually" is a
            rather open-ended concept in this case.<br>
            <br>
            Incidentally, box 477 contained a group of drawings (over
            500 of them) not conforming to the pattern of the other
            G&amp;N drawings. The group included such things as IRNs
            (Interface Revision Notices) and TDRRs (Technical Data
            Releases or Revisions).&nbsp; Right now, it's hard for me to
            deal with these anomalous drawings in the same kind of
            context (i.e., <a href="TipueSearch.html">master
              engineering search engine or</a> aperture-card box index
            pages) as the other drawings.&nbsp; As a result, instead of
            including them on <a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox477.html">the
              box 477 page</a>, I've segregated them onto <a
              href="ElectroMechanical.html#Additional_Engineering_Drawings">a
              separate "Additional Engineering Drawing" portal</a>, from
            which you can still view the scan without any expectation of
            them being pre-digested by me.&nbsp; Several other groups of
            anomalous drawings (from boxes 431 and 472, and elsewhere)
            have been included on that portal as well.&nbsp; I expect
            that the Grumman LM drawings whose scanning will commence
            soon will be handled in that same way, simply because it
            would be incredibly time-consuming for me to treat them
            comparably to the G&amp;N drawings.&nbsp; In other words,
            I'm willing to scan non-G&amp;N drawings, but not to fuss
            with them endlessly.&nbsp; That will be left as an exercise
            for the reader. <img src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16"

            Box 472 is actually the <i>end</i> of the Apollo G&amp;N

            represent things like test procedures for Apollo G&amp;N
            equipment, process instructions pertaining to that
            equipment, and so on.&nbsp; Box 472 also contains a couple
            dozen Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation "interface
            revision notices" for the Lunar Module.&nbsp; I don't
            understand the system for designating those notices, so

            below for 2019-11-11), there is a range of roughly 150 scans
            with randomly mispunched aperture-card metadata.&nbsp; I
            think I've corrected them, but there were so many of them
            that I'm bound to have made a few errors along the
            way.&nbsp; Nor (due to the effort involved) did I bother to
            move all of the corrected scans around to their proper
            positions on the <a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox449.html">index
              page for box 449</a>.&nbsp; In other words, drawing-index
            table on the box 449 page is somewhat out of order.
            Fortunately, all of the scans are within 5-10 rows in the
            index table from where they should actually be located, and
            finding them hopefully isn't too much trouble.&nbsp;
            Probably I'll revisit that page at some point and finish
            fixing it all up nicely.<br>

            boxes 443 and 444.&nbsp; In box 444, there was a
            previously-missing drawing (1020428) with mispunched
            aperture-card data that had incorrectly identified it (as
            1010428).&nbsp; Unfortunately, due to the vast number of
            scans being made, time-pressure has so far caused me to
            often <i>trust</i> the drawing numbers punched in the
            aperture cards, and to assume that only the drawing <i>titles</i>
            need to be corrected.&nbsp; In other words, since the titles
            are the same for all cards with the same drawing number, I
            haven't typically needed to look at every single scan, and
            hence haven't really had any way to detect scans with
            miscoded drawing numbers or revision codes.&nbsp; Over the
            past few days, though, I've been finding such miscodings,
            which have usually ended up in the wrong boxes (as 1020428
            did), rendering them undiscoverable afterward if the drawing
            numbers aren't corrected.&nbsp; So at some point, sadly, I'm
            going to have to revisit these scans and look at every
            single one of them to see if their drawing numbers and/or
            revision codes match the index.&nbsp; At the moment there
            are over 80K scans ... and soon to be over 100K for the
            Apollo G&amp;N system alone.&nbsp; I can't say I'm looking
            forward to that.&nbsp; Anyone to wants to volunteer to help
            with that double-checking would be welcomed eagerly.<br>

            aperture-card boxes 439 and 440 to match the drawings rather
            than the aperture-card metadata.&nbsp; Quite aside from the
            error-prone nature of this activity, due to it being almost
            entirely manual, there was an additional difficulty for box
            439.&nbsp; As you may recall, the microfilm slides of the
            drawings are taped into "aperture cards", which are computer
            punch-cards into which metadata such as the drawing number,
            revision code, etc., has been punched.&nbsp; Well, it looks
            for all the world as if (back when the aperture cards were
            created, whenever <i>that</i> may have been) whoever was
            doing it may have dropped a hundred or so of the microfilm
            frames on the floor prior to taping them into the cards, and
            then picked them up and taped them into the cards <i>without</i>
            checking that the slides were still in the correct
            order.&nbsp; So for this range of 100 or so scans, the
            metadata usually does not match the drawings.&nbsp; The
            drawing numbers are often right (but not always) on the
            messed-up cards, but the revision codes were usually
            wrong.&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; (Or Yipe! if you prefer.)&nbsp;
            Well, I "corrected" all of that on the <a
              href="AgcDrawingIndexBox439.html">box 439 index page</a>,
            but with so many of the scans needing to be fixed, who knows
            how many errors I missed!&nbsp; What can I say?&nbsp; It's a

            two boxes, the scanner began degrading very rapidly toward
            the end of the process ... i.e., the scanner requires
            cleaning.&nbsp; When that happens, it tends to mean that the
            metadata scanned from the cards is often incorrect, which is
            precisely what happened in this case.&nbsp; That metadata
            (drawing number, revision, sheet number, frame number, etc.)
            is used to form the index tables for their respective&nbsp;
            web-pages, so errors in the metadata result in a corrupted
            index.&nbsp; I've corrected many hundreds of entries in the
            indices for boxes 471 and 472 so far, but there's no
            guarantee I've caught all of the errors.&nbsp; Hopefully, if
            there are errors remaining in the index, they'll be caught
            and corrected in the reasonably near future.&nbsp; For now
            (alas!) I'm going to curtail scanning activities until the
            scanner has been cleaned, because finding/correcting the
            drawing index is quite a laborious process.&nbsp; Hopefully
            I'll be able to resume scanning again around the middle of
            next week.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            My short-term goal is to finish scanning all of the Apollo
            G&amp;N boxes (i.e., through box 477) by November 21, which
            is the last day the U.S. government (and hence the National
            Archives) is funded.&nbsp; In other words, if the government
            shuts down on the 21st, then scanning will be impossible for
            the duration of the shutdown.&nbsp; Personally, I think a
            shutdown is highly likely.&nbsp; News reports, on the other
            hand, are so far discounting that possibility.&nbsp; Well,
            we'll see; I'd be happy to be wrong.&nbsp; At any rate,
            after box 477 is scanned, then scanning of the (hopefully!)
            complete set of Grumman Lunar Module aperture cards will
            commence.&nbsp; I expect that process to take the next
            couple of years.<br>

            in which three drawing scans were miscoded (in terms of
            drawing number) and swapped between boxes 431 and 463.&nbsp;
            I only discovered those by accident, since I can't literally
            check <i>every</i> scan ... after all, there are nearly
            45,000 engineering-drawing scans right now!&nbsp; The net
            result of this particular error was that we had a later
            revision of one drawing than we actually knew about, and two
            documents which we had thought were incomplete were actually
            complete after all.&nbsp; So it's entirely possible that
            some additional missing drawings are hidden amongst the
            scans, and we'll only find them by chance unless somebody
            steps up and does some checking.&nbsp; Well, that's life, I

                added to the collection of engineering drawings.&nbsp;
                Box 431 is particularly notable because it contains a
                number of Rework Instruction Bulletins (RIB), of which
                very few have been available previously.&nbsp; Box 431
                also physically contains a few dozen Interface Control
                Drawings from North American Aviation, but because these
                follow a different numbering convention than all of the
                MIT/AC/Ratheon/etc. aperture cards scanned so far, I
                have not yet worked out how they should be processed or
                presented, so I've not yet made them available online
                ... which is the reason that Box 431 is listed as being
                only "partial".&nbsp; Besides that, because of the bulk
                of scans that <i>have</i> been added (~9000 microfilm
                slides), I've not had the opportunity to fix up the
                titles of most of the drawings.&nbsp; For now, most of
                the titles just show up in the index in the 21-character
                abbreviated forms punched into the aperture cards.&nbsp;
                I'll fix them up some time, but it's an ongoing process
                and I won't promise any specific time-table.</li>

            <p>Note that while the newly-added engineering drawings have

                <li>Document ND1002324 (all revisions), for the Block I
                  CM (specifically, CM-014), running SUNSPOT
                  software.&nbsp; According to <a
                    href="hrst/archive/1690.pdf">this document</a> (p.
                  15), CM-014 was used only for testing and was
                  eventually scrapped in 1977.&nbsp; Since the CM was
                  never used for anything other than testing, it's
                  entirely possible that its AGC still had SUNSPOT ropes
                  in it when the CM scrapped, and thus it seems possible
                  that that Block I AGC (or its rope-modules separately)
                  are still floating around somewhere.&nbsp; In other
                  words, SUNSPOT may be recoverable by dumping the
                  contents of those rope modules, if they (and/or their
                  AGC) are ever found.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I neither
                  know where the AGC nor its rope modules are, nor do I
                  know of anyone who has <i>successfully</i> dumped the

                more documents than Box 434, so I won't list them all
                here.&nbsp; They are principally process specifications
                and testing procedures.&nbsp; The most-notable document,

          <td valign="top">Mike has pulled a <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick">hat-trick</a>
            by reconstructing the <a href="Luminary.html#Luminary163">LUMINARY





















              163 and LUMINARY 173</a> source code.&nbsp; Of course,
            I've also taken the much simpler step of adding support for
            them to the VirtualAGC GUI program.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            These were the first and second revisions of LUMINARY
            targeted for the Apollo 14 mission, and their memory modules
            were manufactured but not flown.&nbsp; (Instead, <a
              href="Luminary.html#Luminary178">LUMINARY 178</a>, the
            final released version, which Mike managed to finish
            reconstructing a few days ago, was actually flown.)&nbsp; So
            in just a few days, we've gone from having essentially
            nothing for the Apollo 14 Lunar Module, software-wise, to
            having pretty much everything you'd ever need to know!<br>
            <br>
            It probably goes without saying, but beyond just their
            intrinsic interest on their own, having the complete set
            (163 &amp; 173 &amp; 178) further increases our confidence
            in the reconstruction of each of them individually.&nbsp;
            That's because the reconstruction of 163 is <i>based on</i>
            173, while the reconstruction of 173 is <i>based on</i>
            178.&nbsp; We have confidence in the reconstruction of 178
            because its checksums are correct ... but there's a <i>small</i>
            though non-zero chance that an incorrect memory bank could
            still have a correct checksum.&nbsp; However, it's still
            unlikelier that you could modify an <i>incorrect</i> memory
            bank (from 178) having a <i>correct</i> checksum and
            somehow obtain another bank (from 173) that also had a
            correct checksum, and then modify that bank again to get
            still a third bank (from 163) having a correct
            checksum.&nbsp; Admittedly, that argument doesn't apply to <i>all</i>
            of the memory banks in the program, since not all of them
            needed to be reconstructed for each of these software
            revisions, but it applies to enough of them to give us a
            good feeling that the reconstruction process does exactly
            what we hope it's doing.<br>

              <li>Mike Stewart has managed a true <i>tour de force</i>,
                by reconstructing and contributing the reconstructed <a
                  href="Luminary.html#Luminary178">LUMINARY 178</a>
                source code.&nbsp; LUMINARY 178, you may recall is the
                LM's AGC program for the Apollo 14 mission.&nbsp; It has
                been a sore spot for me for a while, in that we've had
                the LUMINARY code for all <i>other</i> flown missions —
                i.e, Apollo 10-13 and 15-17 — for a long time ... but
                not Apollo 14.&nbsp; It has been the only one
                missing.&nbsp; This is quibbling a little bit, I admit,
                since it ignores Apollo 5 and Apollo 9.&nbsp; But
                technically those missions didn't use LUMINARY; Apollo 5
                used SUNBURST (which we have!) and Apollo 9 used
                SUNDANCE (which we don't!).&nbsp; So I guess the missing
                SUNDANCE will now become the sore spot.&nbsp; But I
                digress.&nbsp; Finally filling in the gap for Apollo 14
                is great no matter how you look at it, but what makes it
                a <i>tour de force</i>, is the <i>vast</i> gap that
                this fills in terms of software changes.&nbsp; The
                Apollo 13 and 15 LM&nbsp; software were LUMINARY 131 and
                210, respectively ... that's 79 revisions in between,
                with Apollo 14 being smack dab in the middle.&nbsp;
                Amazing!&nbsp; So the reconstruction requires figuring
                out the changes for something like 30-50
                revisions.&nbsp; Getting to the end of that process is
                like finding the missing link.&nbsp; It makes the slogan
                you see in the website logo ("Apollo Digital
                Archaeology") seem quite appropriate.&nbsp; Not only is
                the code <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Luminary178">in





















                  the software repository</a> now, but support for it
                has been added to the VirtualAGC GUI.<br>
              </li>
              <li>On a lesser note, I've finally finished proofing the <a
                  href="LVDC.html">LVDC</a> source code's program
                comments.&nbsp; Experience suggests there are still
                quite a few errors I missed.&nbsp; Nevertheless, given
                that the code has been proofed, and assembles to exactly
                the expected core-rope image, I'm finally willing to put
                my stamp of approval on it and say that it's
                "ready".&nbsp; If only ITAR concerns allowed me to
                freely provide it to you ....&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigh!&nbsp;
                Well, a lawyer's working on it, and will perhaps
                discover that the ITAR fears are overblown.&nbsp; Or
                not.&nbsp; At any rate, you can still apply to me on an
                individual basis to get the code if you're a "U.S.
                person" under the law.&nbsp; Next step:&nbsp;

            the "program", since the report is <i>not</i> about
            software.&nbsp; The report is a nice way of getting a
            pretty-detailed understanding of all the different hardware
            Raytheon produced for the program, including all the AGCs,
            DSKYs, and associated ground-support equipment, which is

          <td valign="top">I've unfortunately discovered that our one
            LVDC program listing does not form a complete LVDC
            program.&nbsp; Or at least, that's the conclusion I've come
            to, and until there's some reasonable independent review of
            the code, I fear that my inferences are the only ones that
            count.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll eventually turn out to be wrong.<br>
            <br>
            When I say it's incomplete, I <i>don't</i> mean that there
            are pages missing from the program listing, or anything of
            that nature.&nbsp; The Flight Program listing we have is
            completely self-contained, and can be assembled without
            error ... or at least <i>could</i> be assembled without
            error if a handful of undebugged problems in this
            engineering (as opposed to released) version of the code
            were fixed.<br>
            <br>
            No, what I mean is that the Flight Program was not the <i>only</i>
            program that needed to be loaded into LVDC core memory to
            get a complete working system.&nbsp; At the present time, I
            believe that the missing program would have been the
            Preflight Program.&nbsp; The Flight Program and Preflight
            Program would have interacted via certain addresses
            hard-coded into those programs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, right
            now, when the Flight Program calls routines that are
            supposed to reside at those addresses, there's simply
            nothing there, and chaos would ensue.<br>
            <br>
            For example, I think that one thing the Preflight Program
            probably had was the self-test routine.&nbsp; Very
            handy!&nbsp; And very unhandy not to have it.&nbsp; By the
            same token, a self-test routine is hardly <i>essential</i>
            to the operation of the system, and it might be possible to
            make the Flight Program happy simply by sticking some kind
            of relatively-simple replacement for it at its specified
            hard-coded address.&nbsp; And all of the other problematic
            addresses I've seen similarly relate to code that might be
            painlessly worked around.&nbsp; But I don't have a complete
            survey of all the offending missing code, and can't really
            make too positive a claim at this point.&nbsp; Time will
            tell how serious a problem this turns out to be.<br>

              <li>Manoel has submitted a couple more 3D models,
                2004739A-000 and -021, DSKY front cover.&nbsp; This is
                significant because it turns out that model 2004929
                (also DSKY front cover) added a couple of weeks ago was
                not the one called out for DSKY model 2003994-121 at
                all, and that 2004739 is what should be used.&nbsp; This
                was not just an oversight, though!&nbsp; The problem is
                that drawing 2004739 simply isn't dimensioned very
                thoroughly, whereas 2004929 is dimensioned quite
                thoroughly, so the hope was that 2004929 would be a good
                substitute.&nbsp; Alas, it was not!&nbsp; Some of the
                dimensions (specifically the width and height of
                openings for the indicator lamps) from drawing 2004929
                are not compatible with the other constituent assemblies
                in DSKY 2003994-121.&nbsp; Thus while the new models for
                2004739 are intended to be exact representations of the
                original drawing, there's not enough detail on the
                original drawing to insure that; so the new models
                contain both elements from 2004929, as well as
                measurements which were fortunately able to be gotten
                from a physical 2004739 module.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
                potential for error remains and thus the models may need
                to be further adjusted over time.</li>
              <li>10 new document scans from NARA SW have been
                added.&nbsp; Many of them relate to RTCC software
                flowcharts for various Apollo 14 G&amp;N computations,
                and to GSOP changes from Apollo 13 to 14.&nbsp; Rather
                than enumerate those documents here, I'd suggest looking

              <li>Manoel has added a few more <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/mechanical/3D-models">3D





















                  models for DSKY parts</a>.&nbsp; It should be noted
                that the first two of those models listed below are
                created from the <i>external</i> dimensional properties
                of "Specification Control Drawings" (SCD).&nbsp; That's
                significant because the these assemblies were
                manufactured independently, and while they are really
                themselves assemblies, the internal characteristics of
                the assemblies are (well, <i>were</i>) known only to
                the manufacturers of the assemblies.&nbsp; In other
                words, there are no available drawings describing their
                internal structures.&nbsp; Consequently, you can't
                simply 3D print them and expect that they'll do anything
                for you, particularly since they contain circuitry not
                represented by the 3D models.&nbsp; They'll need to be
                reverse engineered in order to reproduce their
                electrical and behavioral characteristics.&nbsp; The
                third model is also problematic, because we don't have
                the latest revision of its original drawing.&nbsp;
                That's significant, because most DSKY's specify use of
                configuration -001 of the part, while the most-recent
                drawing we have covers only up to configuration
                -000.&nbsp; Consequently, the 3D model also conforms
                only to configuration -000 rather than to the necessary
                -001, and therefore also likely requires modification.<br>

                  models for DSKY parts</a>.&nbsp; I forgot to mention
                yesterday that these are parts for DSKY model
                2003994-121 (the final CM DSKY model), though the parts
                Manoel has submitted so far seem applicable to all Block
                II DSKY models I've checked so far.&nbsp; (Admittedly
                not every single one!)&nbsp; I probably should have
                mentioned too that the models being added so far are
                intended to precisely capture the original Apollo
                engineering drawings, and hence do not include any
                optimizations for (for example) 3D printing; alternate
                3D models with such optimizations may be added in the
                future.&nbsp; Also, for those who haven't stayed atop
                the behind-the-scenes discussions, it's perhaps useful
                information that the models are in <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21">STEP</a>
                format, which can be imported into most 3D modeling
                programs, but specifically into the open-source <a
                  href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>
                modeler.&nbsp; I probably should summarize what those
                parts are, too, rather than forcing you to figure it out
                for yourself.&nbsp; Here's the complete list so far:</li>

                  href="Colossus.html#ARTEMIS71">Artemis 71</a>.&nbsp;
                As you may recall, Artemis 72 is the software actually
                flown in the Apollo 15 through 17 Command Modules.&nbsp;
                But Artemis 71 was originally intended to do so.&nbsp;
                Artemis 72 flew instead, because of a bug fix.&nbsp; As
                with all these software reconstructions that have been
                appearing lately, we have no actual assembly listing of
                Artemis 71 to work from.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the clues
                present in the Artemis 72 assembly listing, in concert
                with the Artemis 71 memory-bank checksums (which we have
                from engineering drawing 2021154), allow us not only to
                infer the required changes, but to verify them
                afterward.&nbsp; Great work, Mike!&nbsp; The VirtualAGC
                GUI program now supports Artemis 71 as well, so you can
                run Artemis 71 or browse its source code in VirtualAGC
                if you like.</li>

                actually know if it was necessary to remove them, but it
                has been done as a precaution.&nbsp; Of the 1000+
                documents we provide, who knows how many have thus been
                (or will be) taken retroactively out of the public

                For what it's worth, I think the documents are available

                to source code, but am afraid now to post it publicly

                start pelting us with Saturn V or Saturn IB rockets if
                they get hold of this 50-year-old software
                listing.&nbsp; (The projected cost of a <a

                in 2019 dollars is around $726M, but that of a <a

                  IB</a> such as would have been used for the AS-206RAM
                mission is probably only around $220M.&nbsp; A bargain,
                to a thrifty hawk!&nbsp; To be fair, when I wrote those
                sentences, they were intended to be biting sarcasm, but

                dollars it doesn't even seem that far-fetched that some
                nut-job would spend $200M for a Saturn IB as an ICBM,

                intellectual game, which I suppose it is in some ways,

                I'll remind you that a few days ago we got the Luminary

                software (for the Apollo 10 LM) that we hadn't had
                originally.&nbsp; In the case of Comanche, the Holy
                Grail would be reconstruction of Comanche 45/2, which is
                the missing mission software for the Apollo 10 CM.&nbsp;
                Having Comanche 51 rather than just Comanche 55 gets us
                that much closer to the goal.&nbsp; Even so, getting
                from Comanche 51 to 45/2 is quite hard, since we don't
                have the level of supporting documentation for Colossus
                that we do for Luminary.&nbsp; A reconstruction of 45/2
                would be ever so much easier if Margaret Hamilton just
                gave us her copy of Comanche 44 ... though that, sadly,
                seems less likely with every passing year.&nbsp; But
                we'll see what we'll see!</li>

                  of the Luminary 97 and 98 source code</a>, following
                the same procedure as for the Luminary 130 and 69 rev 2
                reconstructions over the last couple of days.&nbsp;
                There's slightly less confidence in the Luminary 98
                reconstruction than in the 97 reconstruction, since back
                in 1969 Luminary 98 was just development software <i>en
                  route</i> from 97 to 99, so its ropes were never
                manufactured nor its memory-bank checksums
                recorded.&nbsp; However, if Mike's Luminary 98
                reconstruction were in error, his 97 reconstruction
                would probably be in error as well ... which is unlikely
                since all of <i>its</i> memory-bank checksums are
                correct!&nbsp; In other words, while we're less
                confident of the Luminary 98 reconstruction than in the
                97 reconstruction, we still have a pretty high degree of
                confidence in it.</li>
              <li> On our Luminary page, I long ago hyperlinked the raw

                Archive site.&nbsp; But in some sort of strange mental
                conniption, I belatedly find that I never did that on <a

                guess it's because so much data was pouring in from Don
                Eyles at the time that I was thinking only about the
                Lunar Module and not about the Command Module at
                all.&nbsp; Well, I have finally taken care of it now!<br>

                same process as for yesterday's reconstruction of
                Luminary 69 rev 2.&nbsp; Admittedly not quite as
                exciting as yesterday's reconstruction if you're only
                interested in software actually flown.&nbsp; On the
                other hand, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the
                more software versions we collect the easier it is to
                fill in the gaps between them, so it's nothing to be
                pooh-poohed by any means!&nbsp; (Excuse me, I mean
                P00H-P00H'ed.)&nbsp; Plus, various Apollo 13 documents
                referenced Luminary 130 anyway, and were never revised
                for 131, as far as we know.&nbsp; <br>

                when the windows were made smaller the text overflowed
                to the right and needed scrollbars to see.&nbsp; I can't
                get rid of this effect entirely, but making the
                thumbnails smaller mitigated it somewhat.</li>

          <td valign="top">As you may have noticed in looking at the <a
              href="Luminary.html">Luminary</a> and <a
              href="Colossus.html">Colossus</a> pages, it sometimes
            happens that when somebody gives us a listing of an AGC
            program, it may not be <i>quite</i> the software revision
            used in a flown mission, but since I figure we're never
            going to get the exact revision I end up just shrugging and
            saying it's good enough.&nbsp; But you know, my "figuring"
            has been known to be wrong ... from time to time.&nbsp; Such
            is the case with the Lunar Module software for Apollo
            10.&nbsp; The actual flown revision was really Luminary 69
            Rev 2, whereas the printout we got from Don Eyles was simply
            Luminary 69.&nbsp; Does Luminary 69 work when you fly a
            simulated Apollo 10 mission?&nbsp; Certainly, no
            problem!&nbsp; But it would even better to have the precise
            revision used, wouldn't it?<br>
            <br>
            That's were some of the engineering drawings I (my sole
            contribution to this discussion!) scanned a couple of days
            ago come in.&nbsp; These drawings, <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n65/mode/1up">2021151





















              through 2021154</a>, astoundingly list all of the
            memory-bank checksums for lots of AGC programs ... including
            lots of revisions of programs that we don't have.&nbsp; This
            information, which may seem rather pointless on the face of
            it, actually opens up the door for reconstructing a lot of
            software revisions we don't have. Why?&nbsp; Well, we do
            have source code for an increasingly-large number of
            Luminary and Colossus software revisions, <i>and</i> we
            often have LUMINARY Memos or COLOSSUS Memos that tell us in
            a descriptive way which changes were made between successive
            revisions of the software. This is especially true for
            Luminary.&nbsp; Thus from the <i>descriptions</i> of the
            changes, we can attempt to back-port those changes (as
            observed in later revisions of the software) into earlier
            versions of the software and then <i>check</i> if those
            changes produced the proper memory-bank checksums!&nbsp;
            We've done this in the past in the handful of cases where we
            knew the checksums of unavailable software revisions, but we
            never had such checksums for a large number of missions to
            work with before.<br>

            Thanks, Mike, once again!&nbsp; So while yesterday we had
            Apollo 10 LM software that was "close enough", today we are
            pretty sure we have the exact software used in the mission.<br>

              <li>It turns out that my comments yesterday about SUNDIAL
                D vs SUNDIAL E in the 2TV-1 mission were
                misguided.&nbsp; What I <i>should</i> have been saying
                was that the fixed-memory modules (which are what holds
                the SUNDIAL program) were different than what what the
                engineering documentation led us to believe:&nbsp;
                specifically, if you're interested, MIT's AGC contains
                software assembly 2021104-051 rather than the
                2021104-041 we expected.&nbsp; However, Mike has managed
                to find documentation that both of those assemblies held
                SUNDIAL E software anyway, so it hardly matters which
                one was installed in the computer.&nbsp; Thus I can
                happily contradict what I said in yesterday's
                entry:&nbsp; We truly do have the software for the 2TV-1
                mission!&nbsp; I've altered <a
                  href="Colossus.html#2TV1">the description on the

              <li> The VirtualAGC GUI program has now been updated (at
                GitHub) to have the 2TV-1 mission as one of the options.</li>
              <li>Added a series of documents (thanks, Graham Donald!)
                to the library, concerning potential applications of the
                LM.&nbsp; Also, quite by chance, I found a <a
                  href="Documents/R-700.pdf">grayscale scan of document
                  R-700</a> online that's fantastic, compared to the
                B&amp;W scans we already had, because you can actually <i>see</i>
                the photographs; naturally I snatched it and stuck it in
                the document library too.<br>

              <li>Much like with the RETREAD 50 AGC software we added a
                few weeks ago, <a href="Restoration.html">the AGC
                  Restoration team</a> has now dumped the rope memory
                from the MIT Museum's AGC and has given us the AGC
                program SUNDIAL E.&nbsp; This is our first look at
                SUNDIAL.&nbsp; SUNDIAL E is close to, but presumably not
                exactly the same as, the SUNDIAL D software used for the
                2TV-1 mission, so <a href="Colossus.html#2TV1">that's
                  how I've categorized it on our COLOSSUS page</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;





















                In a larger sense, I think that SUNDIAL was generally
                used for system checkout of Command Modules, much as
                AURORA was for Lunar Modules.&nbsp; We don't have the
                source code yet, since the restoration team has been so
                busy, but presumably Mike will churn it out for us in
                the reasonably-near future by comparing to similar
                program versions and judicious disassembly.&nbsp; The
                binary is apparently ready-to-run in yaAGC, though I
                have not made the necessary changes yet to do so within
                the VirtualAGC GUI environment.</li>
              <li>At the same time, 3 out of the 6 rope modules for the
                program SUNDANCE 302 were dumped, and have been added to
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Sundance302">the





















                  GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp; I've not written up
                anything about it on the LUMINARY page yet, though,
                because I haven't figured out yet how to go about
                describing <i>half</i> of a program.&nbsp; The idea, of
                course, is to try and find the other half of it later.<br>
              </li>
              <li>In thrashing out whether SUNDIAL E was or was not used
                in 2TV-1, it became apparent that some of the
                compatibility tables in documents ND-1021042 and
                ND-1021043 could be used to fill in a couple of
                missing-link engineering drawings related to
                configurations of SUNDIAL and AURORA, so I've now done
                that and regenerated the assembly drilldowns of the
                engineering drawings accordingly.<br>

          <td valign="top">The scan of the assembly listing of the LVDC
            AS-206RAM flight program is now ready.&nbsp; Or at least, <i>a</i>
            perfectly legible scan is ready, though I may make a better
            one later.&nbsp; I've actually been taking this opportunity
            to try out different digitizing methods, so I've scanned the
            thing 4 times so far.&nbsp; That's because I've been very
            dissatisfied with the AGC listings I scanned in the past,
            and I wanted to perfect my method once and for all.&nbsp;
            But because I'm experimenting, the scans aren't quite as
            pretty yet as I'd like.&nbsp; Getting better, though.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="LVDC.html#Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software">As I
              explain in more detail on the LVDC page</a>, we are not
            certain yet about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations">ITAR</a>
            status of this assembly listing:&nbsp; Maybe ITAR restricts
            who the program can be given to ... and maybe it
            doesn't.&nbsp; I kind of think it doesn't.&nbsp; I hope
            we'll eventually find out for sure that it doesn't, and I'll
            then be able to post the scans online.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
            until/unless the legal issue is resolved, it's a close
            enough call that I'll have to assume by default that ITAR <i>does</i>
            restrict access.&nbsp; So if you want the scanned program
            listing, you'll not only have to <strike>email me directly</strike>
            apply to me <i>in person</i>, but you'll also have to
            provide reasonable proof that you're a U.S. citizen,
            tolerate the fact that I'll send you only an encrypted,
            identifiable, watermarked PDF, and be okay with the fact
            that I'll retain a permanent record of you and of the proof
            you provided.&nbsp; That's because ITAR restricts access to
            foreigners but explicitly allows distribution to U.S.
            citizens.&nbsp; The upshot is that if it turns out ITAR <i>does</i>
            restrict access and the listing does end up somehow in
            foreign hands, and somebody does show up at my door with a
            subpoena ... well, <i>my</i> personal posterior will be
            covered, because <i>I</i> will have handed the program only
            to verifiable U.S. citizens.<br>
            <br>
            I've also done a preliminary pass on looking through the
            listing and have written up all my observations and
            inferences about the the syntax and pseudo-operations of
            LVDC assembly language, as well as about the AS-206RAM
            program itself.&nbsp; That's a prerequisite for getting a
            working LVDC assembler, which along with transcribing the
            listing's source code is hopefully the next step.&nbsp; (And
            no, sorry, once I have transcribed the source code, it won't
            be freely distributable either until ITAR questions are
            resolved for the better.)<br>

                version of the LVDC flight program!&nbsp; It's just a
                few pages of trig and square root routines, but you can
                see from the snapshots that there's a full (or at least

                samples.&nbsp; It probably does not conform 100% to the

            drawing 2010094-, which is the READ COUNTER MODULE of
            apparently all Block II Coupling Data Units (CDUs).&nbsp; In
            other words, it is our first CAD transcription of a G&amp;N
            schematic <i>not</i> for the AGC or DSKY.&nbsp; It's a real
            monster, too, at least in terms of physical size, 130"×34",
            though that's mainly because they didn't choose to split the
            drawing into multiple sheets, even though physically it
            consists of 4 separate, almost-independent
            "quadrants".&nbsp; Go figure! <br>
            <br>
            If you've never given the CDU any thought — and I know I
            hadn't! — it's interesting and eerie the way it shadows the
            AGC design.&nbsp; In particular, it consist of "modules",
            plugged into a backplane, with each module being either a
            regular analog circuit or else a "logic-flow" circuit
            consisting entirely of NOR gates.&nbsp; I suppose it's
            reasonable that once they had a design paradigm they'd
            probably stick with it, but it's still fun to see.&nbsp; The
            CDU itself converts data from whatever forms it's available
            in the spacecraft to whatever digital format the AGC needs,
            and vice-versa, so you can think of it crudely as a set of
            A/D and D/A converters ... but from an era where such things
            didn't just come off-the-shelf but had to be designed and
            implemented anew with each project.<br>
            <br>
            But it's also based on a circuit-design practice that we
            associate only with Block I and <i>early</i> Block
            II.&nbsp; For example, the schematic shows no pin numbers
            for the NOR gates, nor distinguishes between the "A" and "B"
            gates of the dual-NOR-gate chips.&nbsp; For that information
            you have to look at an entirely separate drawing, the
            so-called "signal wiring" diagram.&nbsp; That design
            practice fortunately fell out of favor quickly in the AGC
            schematics (thank heaven!), but unfortunately persisted to
            the very end in the CDU schematics ... or at least in the
            CDU READ COUNTER MODULE.&nbsp; As a result, I can't claim
            total confidence of the NOR-gate pin numbers used in the CAD
            transcription, due to the difficulty of proofreading them;
            on the up side, though, probably nobody will ever notice if
            I didn't get some of them quite right!<br>

              <li>In doing some semi-automated checking of the G&amp;N
                assembly drilldowns, I've discovered to my horror that a
                lot of drawings that you'd never suspect were assemblies
                actually are assemblies.&nbsp; Maybe 90% of them!&nbsp;
                I mean, really, who would suspect that something called
                a "cover" or a "plate" is really an assembly?&nbsp; I
                ask you.&nbsp; I never even bothered to look at
                them.&nbsp; The upshot of that is that the assembly
                drilldowns I've made are actually nowhere near as
                complete as I imagined, since I didn't have any support
                for drilling down a bunch of those non-assembly
                assemblies (with apologies to Woodward &amp;
                Bernstein).&nbsp; So I've made a tentative new beginning
                with some updates to the drilldowns, but there's a long
                way to go.</li>
              <li>But there's a bit of a treat today as well:&nbsp; <a
                  href="AgcDrawingIndex.html#GAEC">We've gotten a few
                  top-level LM engineering drawings</a> from the
                aperture-card boxes at NARA-SW, and perhaps someday
                we'll be able to explore the LM engineering drawings in
                much the same way we're now exploring the G&amp;N
                engineering drawings.&nbsp; Check them out!&nbsp; One
                drawback with them is that while each drawing calls out
                the drawings for its sub-assemblies, it does so only by
                drawing number and no drawing name.&nbsp; Furthermore,
                the drawings themselves have only numbers in their title
                blocks, and have no actual titles.&nbsp; So I can't
                personally tell you what most of the assemblies
                are.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to offer up a solution to
                this conundrum, please do so, since it will make
                figuring out these assemblies quite difficult!<br>

            entirely manual, and that this will have (and already does
            have) tremendous advantages.&nbsp; There is still a lot of
            stuff to check (and presumably fix!) in the new

            manually-generated presentation continues to be provided as

            up a bit.&nbsp; The presentation-generation software may
            also be useful to some users, particularly if they need to
            have part-count data, since the software outputs JSON in

            hopefully fill in significantly as the effort of scanning

          <td valign="top">It turns out that there have been serious
            problems in the top-level AGC and DSKY part numbers for the
            LM that I had listed in my <a
              href="ElectroMechanical.html#Browse_the_Available_Engineering">big





















              AGC/DSKY drilldown table</a>.&nbsp; Hopefully those
            problems are fixed now, but there is still work to be done
            on checking the CM portion of the table.&nbsp; This fix has
            the side effect of adding drawing-drilldowns for several
            AGC/DSKY parts for which that wasn't previously
            possible.&nbsp; Additionally, though, it has been determined
            that all of the Block II AGC part numbers previously missing
            from the table due to a lack of drawings are really related
            to parts with available drawings via <i>external</i>
            changes to the AGC rather than internal ones.&nbsp; This has
            provided the opportunity to add drilldowns for all of those
            previously-missing part numbers as well ... at least
            nominally.<br>
            <br>
            A side effect of these problems was that on <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/yaDSKY.html#The_Warning_or_Indicator_Lamps">the





















              yaDSKY page of the website</a>, the mission-by-mission
            arrangements of the DSKY indicator lamps and their colors
            that I posted yesterday also had errors, because they were
            based on the wrong DSKY part numbers.&nbsp; That has been
            fixed, with the result (not too surprisingly) that the
            Apollo 12 LM did have the same indicator lamp arrangement as
            the other missions, rather than a different one as I claimed
            yesterday, and Apollo 5 did as well. <br>
            <br>
            This issue with Apollo 5 is actually slightly interesting,
            in that it turns out there were engineering drawings both
            for the configurations MIT <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n82/mode/1up"><i>delivered</i></a>
            to NASA and separate engineering drawings for those NASA
            actually <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n79/mode/1up"><i>installed</i></a>
            in the spacecraft.&nbsp; These two configurations usually
            call out different AGC and DSKY part numbers.&nbsp; That
            distinction, along with some other subtleties, escaped me
            when creating the drilldown table.&nbsp; For example, MIT
            delivered DSKY 2003985-051 for Apollo 5 (or rather for
            G&amp;N system 603 for LM-1), which has a rather funky
            indicator-lamp arrangement; but NASA ended up installing
            DSKY 2003985-081, which has a "normal" arrangement.&nbsp;
            Who knew?&nbsp; Well, obviously, a lot of people other than
            me!&nbsp; There are changes like that across the board,
            though only this one involved a change in the DSKY's
            lamps.&nbsp; Just one more reason to be careful, I suppose.<br>

                  about it?!!!</i>&nbsp; Why yes, I did, thank you for
                noticing.&nbsp; DSKY 2003994 is one of only a handful of
                cases I've encountered in which there's an inconsistency
                in its drawing tree as to which schematic is
                applicable.&nbsp; The indicator driver module assembly
                (2003952-031) for DSKY 2003994 calls out schematic
                drawing 2005940, whereas the relay circuit assembly
                (2003910-021) of that selfsame indicator driver module
                assembly calls out schematic drawing 2005973
                instead.&nbsp; The two schematics are almost, but not
                quite, identical.&nbsp; Unfortunately there's no way to
                know for certain which is which with the information we
                have at present.&nbsp; Often in this case, we'd resort
                to looking at AC Electronics document ND-1021042, but it
                is <i>also</i> inconsistent, calling out schematic
                2005973 in some places, but showing circuitry from
                2005940 in others.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are quite a
                few circumstantial reasons to believe that 2005973 is
                the correct one ... not least of which that its
                signatures are dated later.&nbsp; You can read all of my

              <li>Back when I originally did the engineering-drawing
                drill-downs for the various AGC and DSKY models that are
                listed on <a
                  href="ElectroMechanical.html#Browse_the_Available_Engineering">the





















                  electro-mechanical page</a>, there were a number of
                drill-downs I couldn't complete, due to missing
                drawings.&nbsp; Well, there are still missing drawings,
                but in the meantime we've acquired lots and lot more
                scans than before, so it should be possible to fill in <i>some</i>
                of those gaps.&nbsp; While it's still early in the
                process of filling in the gaps, here are some of the

                detect incorrect part numbers for things like diodes and
                transistors.&nbsp; Not that it matters too much, since

                  Apollo online digital archive of the University of
                  Alabama at Huntsville</a>, having apparently been
                offline for a couple of years, has returned from
                whatever limbo it may have been in.&nbsp; It contains
                around a thousand documents.&nbsp; I've leafed through
                all of them and pulled down 40 or so for <a
                  href="links.html">our own digital library page</a>
                just in case the UAH site decides to disappear
                again.&nbsp; You can find them in our library by looking
                for the <img alt="" src="new.png" width="36"
                  height="16"> icon.&nbsp; As you might imagine, though,
                given that almost all of this stuff came from Marshall
                Space Flight Center, most of the UAH documents relate to
                the big rocket, and mostly have little direct relevance
                to what's going on here at Virtual AGC.&nbsp; Most of
                the ones I pulled relate to Saturn IV-B stage
                (containing the Instrumentation Unit, containing the
                Launch Vehicle Digital Computer), or to the Apollo
                Telescope Mount (Skylab), or to press materials for
                Apollo 4 through 7. thanks, Hartmuth!</li>
              <li>Thymo van Beers sent me a list of various boo-boos in
                my own AGC developer documentation that need to be
                fixed, and after lazily sitting on that list for a while
                — a couple of months, it looks like — I've finally
                gotten around to incorporating his suggestions.&nbsp;

              electrical CAD transcriptions of AGC/DSKY schematics</a>
            had been bothering me, such as wires that weren't <i>precisely</i>
            vertical or horizontal, extraneous junctions (fat dots) that
            were present because of tiny unnecessary wire segments, tiny
            jogs in a wire, and so forth.&nbsp; So I created a little
            program (which I cleverly call "eelint") to locate such
            problems in the schematic files, after which I then went
            through and "fixed" all of them.&nbsp; I also reran ERC
            (electrical rule check), netlist generation, and image
            rendering on the schematics I fixed, just to make sure I
            didn't break stuff in the process of fixing it.&nbsp; I ran
            into the slight problem that KiCad ERC had itself broken in
            the meantime, so I had to wait a few days for a kind KiCad
            developer to make it work for me again. <img
              src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;
            "Fixed" is in quotes earlier, because I imagine few other
            people would be bothered by such trivial stuff, and probably
            just think it was unnecessary grinding on my part.&nbsp; On
            the plus side, though, KiCad's ERC capability (once it was
            working again) had advanced somewhat since I had originally
            run it on these schematics, so it also found a handful of
            actual electrical problems for me that I was able to
            fix.&nbsp; Thus the exercise wasn't <i>entirely</i>
            pointless.&nbsp; For anyone unlucky enough to have hardcoded
            some links or shortcuts to <a href="KiCad">the PNG files in
              our rendered CAD folder</a>, I'm pretty sure that I ended
            up changing the names of a few of those files, so you might
            want to check your links.&nbsp; My apologies for that.<br>

                "-" and rev "A" (for AGC 2003993) is that in the latter,
                several previously-disconnected gates are connected to
                backplane signals, with the net result that the
                backplane STRT2 signal is wire-NOR'd with the backplane
                signals CLROPE, ROPER, ROPES, and ROPET.&nbsp; However,
                this is a change only on the backplane wiring and not
                within the module itself, so it is not an electrical
                change within the module.<br>

              <li> Because of teething difficulties at the beginning of
                this process of scanning entire boxes of aperture cards,
                there are several instances in type 02 documents in
                which page 18 was misinterpreted as page 1, and thus the
                page 18 scan overwrote the page 1 scan; similarly, in
                which page 28 overwrote page 2 and page 38 overwrote
                page 3.&nbsp; This has been fixed in the Box 459, Box
                460, and Box 461 indices.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; There are
                also related cases in which multiple microfilms of the
                same drawing appear in the aperture-card boxes, but only
                once in our collection due to overwriting of files of
                the same name; this will be eliminated in future boxes
                (i.e., we'll have access to all of the scans, duplicate
                or not), but it doesn't seem worth it to try and fix the
                problem in boxes that have already been scanned.<br>

                (without literally checking all 3600 index entries) the
                indices are fine.&nbsp; It's definitely worth noting,
                though, that the indices were generated from the punches
                on the aperture cards holding the microfilms of the
                drawings, and that not only is the metadata punched
                there not 100% perfect or consistent, but more
                importantly, the scanner manufacturer's software that
                reads the punches during the scan is subject to all
                kinds of problems ... specifically, systematic
                substitution of some characters for other
                characters.&nbsp; Thus my index-generation software has
                to undo a lot of errors introduced by the scanning
                software, and that's impossible to do 100%
                perfectly.&nbsp; So I just hope it's good enough!&nbsp;

                about half the box.&nbsp; Or to put it more bluntly, the
                scanner is broken and needs to be repaired.&nbsp; Box
                461 gets into a lot of G&amp;N components we've ignored

          <td valign="top">As a background task, I'm in the process now
            of trying to scan the <i>complete</i> set of MIT/IL
            electrical and mechanical engineering drawings stored at
            NARA SW.&nbsp; Up to now, I have only been picking and
            choosing the drawings I thought were absolutely needed, in
            order to save time and effort.&nbsp; However, complete scans
            have the advantage of overlooking nothing, and of producing
            much-more-legible scans.&nbsp; The process will take
            years.&nbsp; NARA SW has 1200 boxes, nominally of 2000
            "aperture cards" each, with each aperture card holding a
            microfilm slide of one scanned page.&nbsp; Only 47 of those
            boxes (#431 through #477) have specifically been associated
            <i>so far</i> with the MIT/IL G&amp;N drawings for
            Apollo.&nbsp; Many of the other boxes are known to be for
            Grumman, NAA/Rockwell, etc.&nbsp; So it's unclear just how
            many will need to be scanned in the end ... somewhere
            between 47 and 1196.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png" alt=""
              width="16" height="16">&nbsp; The first two of these
            complete boxes, #459 and #460, have now become
            available.&nbsp; In order to keep our web-pages containing
            the drawing indexes from spiraling <i>too far</i> out of
            control, this has necessitated a change to the structure of
            the drawing indexes.&nbsp; Instead of a single, huge
            drawing-index page such as we had previously (which had
            about 5000 entries before complete boxes started becoming
            available), there will now be a series of such index pages,
            each relatively limited in scope:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>...</li>
              <li><a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox459.html">Index page for
                  box #459</a> (~1800 drawings)<br>
              </li>
              <li><a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox460.html">Index page for
                  box #460</a> (~1800 drawings)<br>

              <li><a href="AgcDrawingIndex.html">Miscellaneous index
                  page</a> (~5000 drawings)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since each aperture-card box corresponds to a specific,
              known drawing-number range, hopefully this will still be a
              relatively easy system to navigate.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I know that most people would handle this by setting up a
              database, so as to be able to find everything by browsing
              or searching the database rather than having hard-coded
              HTML tables of link data, but I'm philosophically
              committed to having a standalone website that doesn't need
              any software on the backend server, and hence could be
              (for example) downloaded to anybody's local system.&nbsp;
              Unfortunately, since (due to storage requirements) almost
              all of the engineering-drawing scans have been put onto
              our Internet Archive site rather than this main Virtual
              AGC site anyway, that principle is already
              invalidated.&nbsp; But still, my philosophy, website-wise,
              is "the dumber the better" in terms of its software
              requirements.&nbsp; And I'm sure that's obvious to anyone
              looking at this site who's <i>au fait</i> on such stuff.<br>

            2003993), so I corrected various bugs in the existing
            2005259A transcription at the same time.&nbsp; Which is good
            since I hadn't really proofed 2005259A very well,
            apparently, and can now regard it as "proofed".&nbsp;
            However, I was unable to find any differences whatever
            between 2005259- and 2005259A, other than the fact that the
            latter had a different revision written in its revision
            block, so it's unclear to my why they felt called upon to
            release revision A at all.&nbsp; They certainly could have
            save <i>me</i> some bother if they hadn't bothered.&nbsp; <img

            Because the availability of the original drawings for the
            Block I DSKYs isn't 100% complete at present, I can't state
            with 100% certainty that these relay-module CAD
            transcriptions cover <i>all</i> models.&nbsp; But as far as
            I can tell with from the available drawings, they do.&nbsp;
            The two implementations appear identical at a glance, but
            have some pretty significant differences when you start
            looking at the details.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they fall into
            a kind of "uncanny valley" (yes, I know I'm using the term
            incorrectly) in which they are so similar that I felt I
            should create 1005780 by adapting the CAD for 1006161, and
            yet at the same time so different that I may have ended up
            spending more time correcting the adaptation than I would
            have simply by transcribing 1005780 from scratch.&nbsp;
            Which would make no difference to you, Dear Reader, I
            suppose, other than the fact that it means that it would
            have been all to easy for me to miss out on
            seeing/correcting errors in 1005780 ... which could still be
            lurking.&nbsp; On the good side, I suppose, it means that
            when I proofed 1005780 I was really doing an extra proofing
            of 1006161 by proxy, and thus was able to see (and correct)
            errors in it that I hadn't seen in my first proofing of
            it.&nbsp; On yet a third hand, however, both of them are so
            complex that I won't feel too confident in either of them
            until I've seen a simulation of some kind.&nbsp; (The nature
            of which is yet to be determined.)<br>
            <br>
            This actually completes the CAD transcription of all Block I
            DSKY schematics, and given that CAD transcription of the
            Block I AGC schematics had already been completed a couple
            of weeks ago, that means that I've now finished all of the
            Block I electrical CAD.&nbsp; Of course, you have to take
            that "all" with a grain of salt, since there's at least one
            known missing original drawing (later-model NAV DSKY keypad)
            which I obviously have not transcribed, and I haven't
            bothered with creating a schematic for the wiring that
            interconnects all of the DSKY modules.&nbsp; But I'm
            pronouncing it "done" anway.<br>
            <br>
            The next goal is filling in all of the gaps in the Block II
            electrical CAD transcriptions.&nbsp; I had completed Block
            II AGC model "2003200" (without any specific dash number)
            about 4 months ago, but the state of our knowledge of the
            specific engineering-drawing trees for the different
            AGC/DSKY models was primitive back then ... indeed,
            practically non-existent.&nbsp; So the task now is to get
            CAD transcriptions for the drawings for <i>all</i> of the
            specific Block II AGC &amp; DSKY models we're
            supporting.&nbsp; <br>

              schematics for module A29 (drawing 1005763), so naturally
              there are no CAD transcriptions for those particular
              modules in those particular AGC models.&nbsp;
              Nevertheless, that's a lot of drawings transcribed to CAD,
              and remarkably good coverage of the Block I AGC electrical
              design!&nbsp; I'm sure there are still plenty of boo-boos,
              such as slightly inconsistent signal names from one module
              to the next, that will need to be worked out over time.<br>

            This turned out to be a bit trickier than usual because of a
            conundrum I ran into in the process, namely that the
            connector pins in the schematic are numbered in an
            impossible way.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; And having no idea
            what that meant, it brought me to a screeching halt,
            mid-transcription.&nbsp; I was tempted to just call it all a
            mistake on the original engineer's part, and renumber the
            connector pins as I liked in the transcribed CAD.&nbsp; But
            that strategy was a bit tricky to rationalize, since the
            original drawing was at revision "F" and thus had already
            been through multiple revisions without this problem (if it
            was one!) having been detected and corrected.&nbsp; Not only
            that, but the partial schematics that had been redrawn in AC
            Electronics document ND-1021041 <i>agreed</i> with the
            impossible numbering in the schematic, to the extent that
            ND-1021041 deigned to provide those kind of details.&nbsp;
            So what was happening?&nbsp; It was maddening!&nbsp; Had the
            spacetime continuum become not merely warped, but completely
            bent?&nbsp; Was it a sign at last that those fakers back in
            the 60's had slipped up, and I finally had the evidence in
            hand to out the whole fraudulent "moon landing" hoax as a
            public disgrace?&nbsp; Had I, indeed, finally slipped into
            madness or senility and needed to be carted away to an
            institution of some appropriate flavor where I would only be
            fed soft foods in perpetuity and given pills in little paper
            cups to be swallowed under the watchful eyes of white-coated
            people?<br>
            <br>
            Fortunately, no.&nbsp; I asked for help in resolving the
            problem, and as it often turns out in these situations, Mike
            Stewart (thanks, Mike!) happened to know something that I
            didn't know, namely that this circuit module, of which two
            are used in the Block I AGC, is plugged in <i>backwards</i>
            in slot B11, even though it is plugged in forwards in slot
            B10.&nbsp; Thus the pin numbering for module B11 is the
            opposite of that for module B10, even though the two are
            physically identical.&nbsp; This entirely resolves the
            paradox.<br>

            spacetime, were saved on this day, the Nones of March, in

                modules in question are basically all of the analog "B"
                modules (as opposed to the digital "A" modules).&nbsp;
                What this nonsense statement means is that the reference

                those physically marked on the original modules, as
                opposed to using many reference designators arbitrarily

                only really meaningful to someone working with actual

              <li>In the very first Block I AGC schematic drawing I
                transcribed to CAD I had stupidly misread a
                connector-pin number, and since that very same block of
                circuitry appeared identically in the subsequent 17
                Block I AGC schematics I've transcribed, I had ended up
                propagating the error into 18 CAD drawings.&nbsp; Yay,
                me!&nbsp; At any rate, that's now fixed, and shouldn't
                have had any effect on anybody anyway, since it was an
                "AGC 4" pin number rather than an "AGC 5" pin

                associated with it (<a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch2Images#page/n17/mode/1up">drawing





















                  1006130-</a>), which is needed for determining
                reference designators and input-pin assignments for the
                NOR gates, was essentially illegible regardless of how I
                attempted to post-process it.&nbsp; Check it out if you
                think I'm exaggerating the horrific quality of this
                drawing!&nbsp; Of course, I <i>could</i> have just
                ignored the wiring diagram completely and arbitrarily
                assigned these values without affecting the electrical
                functionality in any way, as I've already done for a
                couple of schematics in which the wiring diagrams were
                missing completely.&nbsp; But for some reason I got the
                idea in my head that I could extract the NOR-gate
                reference designators and input-pin assignments from the
                wiring diagram <i>in spite of</i> the fact that the
                drawing itself was illegible.&nbsp; And indeed, it
                turned to be <i>almost</i> possible to do that
                perfectly.&nbsp; In the end, it turned out that only two
                gates which were wired in parallel couldn't be
                distinguished from each other, so that for them I had
                two reference designators and two gates and didn't know
                which went with which.&nbsp; Hardly the worst problem
                one could have!&nbsp; In other words, overall the
                reverse-engineering of the wiring diagram worked out
                quite well.&nbsp; Pointless, I know, since it would seem
                so totally unnecessary to anyone not obsessed with
                authenticity, but weirdly satisfying in a
                digital-archaeology sense.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png"

            you like.&nbsp; This is actually a case where the
            availability of the official schematic doesn't necessarily
            obviate the need for the ND-1021041 schematic, because the
            latter contains a lot of information about backplane signals
            that the former does not.&nbsp; In fact, between the two, it
            contains <i>most</i> of the information on that
            topic.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Only the pages for AGC models <a href="1003700-051.html">1003700-051</a>
            and <a href="1003700-071.html">1003700-071</a> have been
            updated with this information, because we don't actually
            have the particular assembly drawings for the other Block I
            AGC models that would tell us that 1006540 is the proper
            schematic and 1006120 is the proper wiring diagram. <br>
            <br>
            By the way, this is the <i>last</i> of the schematics that
            I "recovered" from ND-1021041 prior to the availability of
            the true original Block I drawings, so I am now officially
            caught up and can begin transcribing schematics for Block I
            AGC/DSKY modules that haven't been dealt with yet.&nbsp; My
            final judgement on the schematics recovered from ND-1021041
            is that ND-1021041 has a lot of errors in it, particularly
            in so far as connector pins are concerned, so it's good
            thing we now have the original drawings.&nbsp; But in spite
            of that, ND-1021041 is almost always correct about
            everything else, and is a fantastic resource when working
            with this material.&nbsp; Furthermore, most of the
            connector-pin errors seemed to have been the result of
            accidentally occasionally using pin numbers from an earlier
            version of the device, which is probably not a problem that
            would occur with the analogous Block II document
            ND-1021042.&nbsp; Only a couple of things were uncovered
            that I interpreted as actual electrical <i>errors</i> in
            ND-1021041, though I had only recovered 7 modules, and 7
            modules do not an AGC make.&nbsp; So all in all, good job AC
            Electronics!<br>

            discrepancies remained.&nbsp; In point of fact, the only

              href="ElectroMechanical.html">the electro-mechanical page
              has been basically restructured from the ground up and
              rewritten to both be a tad simpler and at the same time to
              provide far more actual electro-mechanical information
              than before</a>.&nbsp; Instead of providing the electrical
            drawings for a half-dozen Block II AGC/DSKY models as
            before, it provides electro-mechanical drawing trees (i.e.,
            electrical <i>and</i> mechanical drawings) for 30 or so
            Block I and Block II AGC and DSKY models.&nbsp; And could be
            made to provide quite a few more, if there turns out to be
            any reason to do so.&nbsp; Admittedly, the drawing coverage
            is not perfect, since not only was NARA's coverage of the
            drawings a bit spotty, but also I had limited time to scan
            them ... and wasn't helped by the fact that the government
            (and consequently NARA) was shut down for the last
            week.&nbsp; Okay, nothing's perfect!&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Incomplete or not, the restructuring provides a much more
            useful and interesting view of the AGC/DSKY electrical and
            mechanical design than we had before.&nbsp; The
            electro-mechanical page is now a portal providing two main
            ways of browsing the set of available drawings:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A flat view of the drawing set, ordered by drawing
                number and revision.</li>
              <li>A hierarchical view of the drawing set, ordered by
                G&amp;N (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system type ... or
                if you prefer to think of it that way, by Apollo mission
                number, or by AGC or DSKY part number.&nbsp; In this
                hierarchical view, you navigate through the drawings on
                an assembly-by-assembly basis for whatever G&amp;N
                system, mission number, or AGC/DSKY part number you feel
                like.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All other supplemental information provided by the
              electro-mechanical page is now subordinated to this basic
              drawing-browsing activity.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Some information that I deemed uninteresting and
              distracting was (gasp!) even removed from the page
              entirely, and <i>not</i> provided separately.&nbsp; I
              don't know that I've ever done anything like that
              before.&nbsp; It was only the table of serial numbers for
              AGCs and DSKYs that was removed, though, and I felt the
              information was buggy and too difficult to correct, so I
              don't actually think losing it is much of a loss at
              all.&nbsp; If anyone disagrees and thinks it was valuable
              in some way, drop me a line.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the drawings are arranged in this fashion, I'll
              have to somewhat modify my prior claims that we now have
              all of the DSKY and AGC schematics.&nbsp; There are so
              many engineering drawings needed for any given model of
              AGC or DSKY that there's no single AGC or DSKY model for
              which we have anything like a full set of drawings.&nbsp;
              Naturally, I'd like to have a complete set, not just for
              some AGC/DSKY model, but for <i>all</i> of them.<br>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, all of the models are generally so
              similar — after all, all of the AGCs in either of the two
              "blocks" can run the same software as any of the others,
              mostly, so how different could they really be? — that
              there's a lot of mixing and matching among different unit
              types that you can do.&nbsp; In that sense, we have most
              of the drawings in so many different versions, you can
              almost always find <i>something</i> that will work for
              you if you don't have the specific drawing you want,
              either electrically or mechanically.&nbsp; In that sense,
              you could say we not only have have all of the drawings,
              but have them many times over.<br>
            </p>
            <p>What?&nbsp; You think that sounds specious?&nbsp; It's a

            </p>
            <p>At any rate, over the course of 2019 I'll be working to
              fill in the gaps in the AGC/DSKY drawing-set as much as
              possible.&nbsp; There's also the possibility of extending
              it to other G&amp;N components such as the CDU, since NARA
              has drawings for basically all of the G&amp;N
              components.&nbsp; And I'll also return to transcribing the
              Block I schematics into CAD, which is what I was doing
              before I started spending every day over at NARA.&nbsp; It
              will be a lot easier now that I actually have <i>real</i>
              Block I drawings instead of having to "recover" schematics
              from the bits and pieces in AC Electronics document
              ND-1021041.&nbsp; It will be interesting to compare the
              real schematics (once they're in CAD) to the "recovered"
              ones I made before we discovered that the real drawings
              still exist.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, as usual, I'll note that since the changes to
              the electro-mechanical page are so sweeping, it's
              unavoidable that there are bugs in it, particularly in the
              new drawing trees.&nbsp; Hopefully we'll be able to clean
              those up in a timely fashion.<br>

            This section is now completely up-to-date with respect to

            that time and money pressure caused me to scan them in a
            really sleazy fashion, using a portable flatbed scanner,
            rather than the fancy NARA equipment, so the document scans
            are incredibly poor quality.&nbsp; The results are very
            uneven, with many pages having been digitized quite well,
            but with the majority having some blurry parts, and a few
            pages even being illegible.&nbsp; My excuse is that the
            scans are better than nothing, and you wouldn't have them at
            all if I hadn't done it that way.&nbsp; So there!&nbsp; Even
            so, I think I'll try to improve on my method the next time I
            go out for a round of scanning at NARA ... which may be a
            very long time, since the government is now in a shutdown
            mode that will likely keep NARA closed until 2019, when my
            vacation time will be back at zero.<br>

            Kidding aside, though, the Instrumentation Lab Block I
            electrical drawings I alluded to yesterday have magically

            drawings, so perhaps I messed up when I made my shopping
            list and will have to try again.&nbsp; At any rate, what has
            been added is a <i>complete</i> set of the official
            electrical schematics for the Block I AGC p/n 1003700, and
            mostly-complete sets (missing the keyboard module) for Block
            I nav &amp; main DSKYs 1003706 &amp; 1003707.&nbsp; You have
            to take that with a slight grain of salt, since most of the
            drawings are actually 1 or 2 revisions off from what we were
            looking for; but I'm not sure how much confidence we can
            have that the revisions we were looking for were necessarily
            the right ones anyway, so that doesn't sound like a great
            problem.&nbsp; Particularly not when the alternative
            situation (yesterday!) was that we had none of the Block I
            official drawings at all.&nbsp; In fact, whether or not we
            have the precise revisions we were targeting, we have lots
            and lots of revisions we weren't targeting.&nbsp; A typical
            example might be that we were targeting rev G of a drawing
            but only got revs -, A, ..., F.&nbsp; Lest you doubt my
            word, there are over 200 such drawing scans.<br>

            going to pause most of the effort of recovering the <i>rest</i>
            of the Block I schematics from AC Electronics document
            ND-1021041 for the moment.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, because of
            some crazy news I got today.&nbsp; As you know, we don't
            have the official drawings for the Block I schematics, and
            that's why I've been resorting to "recovering" them from the
            blocks of circuitry in ND-1021041's figures.&nbsp; That's
            obviously not 100% satisfactory (though it's infinitely
            better than having no schematics at all <img alt=""
              src="smiley.png" width="16" height="16">), because of the
            errors and omissions inherent in AC Electronics's redrafting
            of the drawings, the lack of versioning of the drawings
            obtained in this way, and the fact that the "recovered"
            drawings simply <i>look</i> nothing like the
            originals.&nbsp; But in theory, the recovery process should
            still produce a very close approximation of the original
            design, if AC Electronics didn't screw up too badly.<br>
            <br>
            Whatever.&nbsp; The crazy news from today is that it looks
            like there's a high probability of getting the official
            drawings themselves in the near future, for both the AGC and
            the main/nav DSKYs ... all except drawing 1006545 (AGC
            module A23).&nbsp; So I'll still recover that one from
            ND-1021041.<br>
            <br>
            Anyway, I don't want to say much more than that right now,
            since the Universe doesn't like that kind of thing and would
            probably try to queer the deal if I did. <img alt=""
              src="smiley.png" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; The
            transcriptions done so far won't be a total waste, of
            course, since if we do manage to get and transcribe the
            official drawings, when we can use the recovered drawings to
            do automated cross-checks of the netlists and
            what-not.&nbsp; Even so, the time spent on it is time I'm
            not going to be getting back, unless karma is a real thing.<br>

            ND-1021041 for 1006540 (AGC modules A1-A16, "logic flow

            (including parity) in the memory/register words, each using
            the same physical module, but different signals are input
            and output to each of them from the backplane.&nbsp; Plus, a
            number of internal signals are presented to the backplane
            and can be wired up differently there, creating circuits
            that are superficially somewhat different from what you'd
            naively expect from the drawing.&nbsp; So while the drawing

            logo and project name in the title block, along with some
            other changes to slightly reduce the ugliness of the
            things.&nbsp; Consequently, the yesterday's transcription of

            <br>
            Mainly, though , I recovered CAD drawings from document
            ND-1021041 for Block I AGC schematic drawing 1006552, "Logic

            went much better than yesterday's drawing, with no obvious
            errors in document ND-1021041.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            There <i>is</i> a problem with the Block I transcriptions
            that I forgot to mention yesterday, though, in that
            ND-1021041 doesn't always list backplane signal names in its
            schematics when the connectivity is obvious from the
            drawing, so if you have <i>just</i> the transcribed
            schematics, you can't deduce all of the backplane
            connections from it.&nbsp; I'm currently assigning those
            otherwise-unnamed connector pins with names like P<i>M_N</i>,
            where <i>M</i> is the module number and <i>N</i> is the
            pin number.&nbsp; I supplement that scheme by maintaining a
            connectivity database as I go along that tells which of the
            P<i>M_N</i> pins are connected to which other P<i>M_N</i>
            pins. &nbsp;&nbsp; For example, pins P33_65 and P33_77 in
            module A33 are connected to pin P34_53 via the backplane. <br>
            <br>
            Eventually I'll eliminate the P<i>M_N</i> names entirely, by
            assigning unique but logically-reasonable or arbitrary names
            to those as-yet-unnamed backplane nets.&nbsp; That's simply
            not too convenient at <i>this</i> stage.&nbsp; For now, for
            drawings I've already transcribed, the files <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/schematics/Scripts/pinsBlockI.txt">pinsBlockI.txt</a>
            and <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/schematics/Scripts/connectionsBlockI.txt">connectionsBlockI.txt</a>
            in our github repository can be used to get lists of block I
            backplane connector pin names and of backplane nets that
            aren't yet obvious from the pin names.&nbsp; Fortunately,
            there aren't too many of them, percentage-wise.<br>

          <td valign="top">I've "recovered" or "regenerated" my first
            first draft of a Block I AGC schematic drawing, namely
            drawing 1006547, "Logic Flow G", modules A33 and A34, which
            corresponds roughly to the Block II scaler module A1.&nbsp;
            By "recovery", I'm referring to the fact that we don't have
            a copy of any of the revisions of the official drawing
            1006547, but we do have AC Electronics document
            ND-1021041.&nbsp; ND-1021041 seemingly contains the entire
            Block I AGC schematics, but redrawn and grouped logically
            across a large set of Figures.&nbsp; For example, all of the
            schematics for drawing 1006747 seem to be in Figures 4-59,
            4-153, 4-165, and 4-181.<br>
            <br>
            There are pluses and minuses to this recovery process.&nbsp;
            For one thing, ND-1021041 is far more legible than any of
            our scans of the official AGC schematic drawings.&nbsp; On
            the other hand, though these schematics are functionally
            identical (hopefully!) they are by no means visually
            identical to the originals, so it still leaves us without a
            clue as to how the originals actually looked.&nbsp; Nor does
            ND-1021041 have any of the original notes from the drawings,
            nor the parts lists that usually appeared as tables in the
            originals.&nbsp; So I've eliminated certain visual conceits
            in my transcription, such as no longer adding
            Instrumentation Labs borders or title blocks to them.<br>
            <br>
            And frankly, if my experience so far is in any way
            representative, ND-1021041 introduced a lot of drafting
            errors that were not present in the original drawings.&nbsp;
            Consequently, these "first drafts" are more "drafty" than
            we're used to <img src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16"
              height="16">, and it will take longer to wring out the
            errors from them.&nbsp; Though once I've recovered enough of
            the logic modules to perform Verilog simulations of the
            logic — i.e., to run Block I software on the simulated
            electronics — we can obviously start to feel good about the
            process; but that's somewhere in the distant future right
            now.&nbsp; Fortunately, a lot of drawing 1006547 should be
            simulable in a stand-alone fashion, though I haven't done it
            just yet.<br>
            <br>

            <a href="ElectroMechanical.html">electro-mechanical page</a>.&nbsp;
But





















            I think it's pretty swell anyway.<br>
            <br>
            That's not the end of the CAD-transcription story, of
            course, in that there are two other versions of the Block II
            AGC with schematic drawings remaining to be transcribed or
            regenerated, plus the Block I AGC, plus intermediate
            revisions of the schematic drawings, plus mechanical
            drawings.&nbsp; May take a while.<br>
            <br>
            In an unrelated development, the comments about the AGC's
            integrated-circuit usage on the electro-mechanical page have
            been tweaked to account for the Block I AGC's NOR-gates, as
            well as sense-amplifier integrated circuits.<br>

              <li>One of the documents from Russ Larson's papers, namely
                <a href="Documents/agcis_13_yul.pdf">the YUL
                  documentation</a> mentioned last time, actually has a
                very short Block I AGC sample program called TRIVIUM (by
                "IMA NIT-PICKER") attached to the end of it.&nbsp;
                Considering that this is only the 2nd Block I AGC
                program we've ever seen, after Solarium, that's
                reasonably exciting.&nbsp; At any rate, <a
                  href="Colossus.html#TRIVIUM">TRIVIUM</a> has therefore
                been <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/TRIVIUM">transcribed
to





















                  source code</a>, and added to our repertoire of AGC
                programs.&nbsp; Because its purpose was to demonstrate
                the usage of YUL, TRIVIUM contained some deliberate
                errors that actually made its assembly by YUL (or yaYUL)
                fail, so I've also created a version called
                "TRIVIUM-repaired" that has those errors fixed, and <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/TRIVIUM-repaired">added
that





















                  program on github as well</a>.</li>
              <li><a href="SCDs/">We've gotten in a heap of SCDs, or
                  "specification control drawings", for the various
                  electronic and mechanical components used in the AGC
                  and DSKY designs</a>.&nbsp; For our purpose, these
                basically serve the purpose of manufacturers' datasheets
                for the components, and we have them for all but a
                handful of the parts used in the electrical/mechanical
                design.</li>
              <li>The Verilog-based simulation of the AGC electrical
                design that I've been mentioning in the last few updates
                has reached the point of being <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Validation">able
to





















                  run (and <i>pass</i>) the AGC's suite of Validation
                  software</a> that we use to help insure the accuracy
                of yaAGC.&nbsp; That's not to say that it's <i>perfect</i>,
                since there are still known discrepancies between the
                simulation's behavior at a very-detailed level and Mike
                Stewart's earlier, independently-created
                simulation.&nbsp; I'm tracking down those errors and
                fixing them over time.&nbsp; Also, the even fancier <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Borealis">Borealis
software





















                  test suite</a> hasn't yet been tried, since there are
                various technical problems with doing so that will need
                to be overcome first.</li>
              <li>Another AGC schematic has been transcribed, this time
                for AGC module A52, drawing 2003305B, the "restart
                monitor", and thus added to <a

                  transcribing the AGC schematics into CAD, and then in

                can now actually fire up the full-AGC simulation with
                it.&nbsp; There's no erasable or fixed memory
                implemented yet, so all the simulation does is basically
                to jump to the start vector (address 4000 octal) ... at
                which point the "instructions" it starts fetching from
                the non-existent rope are nonsense.&nbsp; But still,
                just getting to this point is a pretty significant
                milestone.&nbsp; Of course, all I'm doing is lagging by
                a couple of years <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/agc_simulation">what
Mike





















                  Stewart already has already had working</a>, albeit
                developed with somewhat different design criteria in
                mind, and therefore quite different in terms of details
                of the implementation.</li>
              <li>And speaking of Mike, you may recall that we've been
                getting a vast trove of documentation and software from
                Don Eyles the last couple of years, but that
                periodically we've mistakenly mentioned that Don's stash
                had finally been exhausted.&nbsp; What Don had forgotten
                to mention to us, though, is that Russ Larson's and
                George Silver's widows had turned over 6-7 boxes <i>each</i>
                of <i>their</i> papers, and that Don was mostly
                unfamiliar with the contents of those boxes.&nbsp; Mike
                immediately hopped on a plane and spent what I suspect
                was a subjectively <i>very long</i> long-weekend
                indexing those boxes, and then scanning a few items that
                seemed most-immediately pressing.&nbsp; The boxes
                contained nearly 800 items in total.&nbsp; As a result
                of Mike's lost weekend, there are 98 new items in <a
                  href="links.html">the document library</a> today, with
                (presumably) a lot more of the remaining ~700 items to
                come in the future as we work out the pragmatic details
                of how to accomplish that.&nbsp; Many thanks to all
                concerned!&nbsp; Here's an executive summary of the some
                of the more-significant items we've got so far, from my
                point of view. I think that overall it would be fair to
                say that there's an emphasis on AGC hardware vs software

                  KiCad-to-Verilog translator script</a> (in Python)
                that works for several of our transcriptions of AGC

                  of AGC module A1 (drawing 2005259A)</a> actually works
                and behaves identically with what ND-1021042 says it
                should.&nbsp; So as far as I can tell right now, that
                means that the CAD for module A1 is 100% correct.&nbsp;
                But I want to write that up in detail at some point,
                with pictures, and haven't done so yet.&nbsp; Plus, it
                still leaves us a pretty long way from running a full
                simulation of the complete AGC logic.&nbsp; You can't

                Mike Stewart's <a
                  href="http://apolloguidance.computer/pins">pin
                  database for the AGC backplane</a> (into which the

                to have a little confidence in these new CAD
                transcriptions.&nbsp; (The reason for these new
                transcriptions is that Mike's earlier ones weren't
                intended to duplicate the visual appearance of the
                original schematics, nor to reflect versioning
                differences, but merely to relect the final version of
                the hardware as accurately as possible.)&nbsp;
                Roadmap-wise, this should be the minimal set of drawings
                needed for hardware simulation of the AGC logic (as
                opposed to its analog characteristics), so that is
                something I'm going to start thinking about seriously
                now, as well as transcription of all of the drawing
                versions that haven't been transcribed yet, extending to
                the later model 2003993, and the earlier model 2003100.</li>

            the drawings I've been adding so far, in the sense that
            those prior drawings all provided a "flat" design, whereas
            today's is purely hierarchical.&nbsp; In other words, even
            though the prior drawings may have consisted of two or three
            sheets sometimes, that was really only due to the fact that
            the design was simply too big to fit on a single page, so
            the designers split it up into more.&nbsp; If you had a big
            enough piece of paper, you could have stuck the stuff on all
            those sheets onto the one large page with no other
            change.&nbsp; With the interface module, however, the design
            uses 5 smaller subcircuits, represented by separate CAD
            files that appear over and over again in the main
            circuit.&nbsp; For example, the "P" subcircuit appears more
            than 10 times, while the "C" subcircuit is used over 30
            times.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that added complexity causes the
            CAD design to look not quite as similar to the original
            drawing, but it still is a pretty fair visual approximation.

            <br>
            If I haven't so commented before, I should mention that for
            these electrical schematics I've been prioritizing
            transcription speed — i.e., I'm trying to get a minimally
            complete set of schematics transcribed and online as soon as
            possible — relative to accuracy.&nbsp; So while I think the
            transcriptions are pretty accurate, and they do all pass
            KiCad's ERC (automated error check), there are undoubtedly
            errors in them that will only be caught in proofing directly
            against the scanned drawings.&nbsp; And I haven't done a lot
            of proofing on them.&nbsp; So, anyone who is interested in
            participating in such a proof-reading process, feel free to
            step forward.&nbsp; Fortunately, unlike the schematic entry
            process itself, it doesn't involve a lot (or any) knowledge
            of electronics or electronics design tools to do so, and is
            simply a matter of comparing two drawings
            side-by-side.&nbsp; For example, here are the original
            scanned drawing and the CAD-generated drawing for module A13
            (click to enlarge):<br>
            <br>
            <div align="center"><a

            </div>
            <br>
            A good example of the <i>need</i> for proofing is the
            drawings for modules A8, A9, A10, and A11.&nbsp; These
            drawings are so similar to each other that only A8 was
            actually transcribed, while the drawings for A9-A11 were
            merely adapted from the drawings for A8.&nbsp; This sped
            things up a lot, sure, and it eliminated a lot of potential
            errors ... but it also <i>masked</i> various other types of
            potential errors by making it very hard for me to see
            them.&nbsp; Proofing will be so important!<br>
            <br>
            As far as the "minimally complete" set of drawings is
            concerned, I'm referring to AGC p/n 2003200-011 and DSKY p/n
            2003950-011, since this is the combination of units for
            which we can most-plausibly say that we have the exact
            revisions of all the drawings we need.&nbsp; Earlier and
            later AGC/DSKY part numbers will follow, and (I think) will
            all arguably be close enough to being complete drawing sets
            as desired for any <i>practical</i> purpose, but not in the
            mindlessly-obvious sense that 2003200/2003950 is
            complete.&nbsp; The reason my earlier comments (below) refer
            to all of the CAD drawings being added as the "flight
            version" even though they're for AGC 2003200 is that many of
            the drawing revisions for AGC 2003200 really <i>are</i>
            identical to the drawing revisions for AGC p/n 2003993 (the
            flown AGC p/n), and the ones added so far are among
            those.&nbsp; But eventually there will be some drawings
            added that are close to the flown revision without being
            100% identical to them.<br>

                list is now maintained in our github repo, for
                maintenance purposes, and therefore can theoretically be
                corrected or extended by someone other than Mike. </li>
              <li> Hartmuth has sent along a ton more Apollo and Gemini
                files that he had scavenged from NTRS over the years and
                that we hadn't already noticed ourselves.&nbsp; About
                130 of them by my count.&nbsp; So they've been added to
                <a href="links.html">the document library</a>.&nbsp;
                This caused me to notice a few links to existing docs
                that were messed up, and so I've fixed those; on the
                other hand, having added so many new docs at once, I've
                undoubtedly messed up quite a few of their links, and
                will have to find and fix those in the near future.<br>

              <li>It turns out that in all of the drawings so-far
                converted from the AGC Handbook to CAD (namely, drawings
                2005902B, 2005903A, 2005952-, and 2005973r), I had
                misinterpreted what were supposed to be connector pins
                as global nets.&nbsp; Those have all now been
                fixed.&nbsp; These schematics now all pass KiCad's ERC
                (Electrical Rule Checker), with the happy side effect
                that a few connections which didn't quite "connect"
                before, due to wire endpoints being physically very
                close visually but not actually touching, have been
                fixed as well.&nbsp; None of this makes a significant <i>visual</i>
                difference in the images created from the CAD files —
                mainly, little rectangular boxes with numbers in them
                have been replaced by little ovals with the same numbers
                in them — but it's a world of difference electrically
                and in terms of confidence in the transcription.</li>
              <li> All of the available drawings from the AGC Handbook

                now been transcribed to KiCad, and thus have "pretty"
                drawings associated with them on the <a
                  href="ElectroMechanical.html">electro-mechanical page</a>.&nbsp;
They





















                actually turn out to all be identical, except that they
                have different choices of some resistor and capacitor
                values.</li>

                  document ND-1021042 as a guide.&nbsp; The need for a

              href="ElectroMechanical.html">electro-mechanical page</a>,
            first mentioned a couple of days back, is a notebook called
            the AGC Handbook, given to us by Don Eyles.&nbsp; This is
            not so much a "document" as it is (or <i>was</i>) an
            evolving collection of electrical and mechanical drawings
            for the Block II AGC and DSKY.&nbsp; I'm not sure just how
            many drawings are in the book, but it has around 550 pages,
            and the drawings average around two pages each.&nbsp; So ...
            a <i>lot</i> of drawings.&nbsp; At any rate, Mike Stewart
            has finished scanning it, and we now have the complete thing
            online.&nbsp; In a slight variation from our usual practice,
            the document-library page of the website has been bypassed,

            It is known that there was a Block I AGC Handbook as well,

            covering later versions of the AGC/DSKY, but we don't have
            any such handbooks.&nbsp; We never heard of them before Don
            Eyles broached the subject a couple of weeks ago, and so
            never even knew to look for them.&nbsp; If you know of any
            AGC Handbooks anywhere, please let us know, so that we can

              <li>As students of AGC assembly language know, the AGC
                language is actually an intermixture of pure machine
                code (called "basic" instructions) and higher-level
                instructions ("interpretive" instructions) that are
                executed on a built-in interpreter which is itself is
                written in basic instructions.&nbsp; In an AGC program
                such as LUMINARY or COLOSSUS, a sequence of interpretive
                instructions is marked by the fact that it begins with
                the basic instruction <tt>TC INTPRET</tt> (to <i>start</i>
                a block of interpretive code) or <tt>TC DANZIG</tt> (to
                return to interpretive code from a basic-instruction
                subroutine called by interpretive code);&nbsp; other
                basic instructions precede the <tt>TC INTPRET/DANZIG</tt>,
                while interpretive instructions follow it.&nbsp; All
                very well and good ... but while INTPRET is clear, why<i><u>DANZIG</u></i>?&nbsp;





















                Danzig is obviously (or <i>was</i> obviously) the name
                of a city in Poland, but is that significant
                somehow?&nbsp; Since this is the kind of thing I worry
                about, I've wondered about it since the beginning of
                this project, about 15 years ago.&nbsp; But on that
                issue, today is the day to stop wondering! I now know
                why, and you can know why too, if you follow <a

                graced us with his preliminary notes on what an improved
                AGC architecture, which he terms "Block III", might look
                like.&nbsp; Well his thinking on the subject, upon which

              <li>On the AGC assembly-language page of this site, my
                intention was always to create a comprehensive manual
                for AGC assembly language.&nbsp; While this was <i>somewhat</i>
                successful for the AGC's so-called "basic" instructions,
                it turned out to be sadly completely inadequate for the
                AGC interpreter language, whose descriptive section was
                basically a promisory note for future content that I
                ended up never creating.&nbsp; In other words, if you
                wanted to read anything about the interpreter
                instructions, you couldn't read my lovely verbiage about
                it, but would pretty much have to fall back on the
                original Instrumentation Lab documents.&nbsp;
                Unthinkable!&nbsp; But wait ... suddenly Mark Schulman
                (thanks, Mark!) has stepped in to fill the void I
                left.&nbsp; He has written just such a guide for the
                interpreter language as I envisaged, and has gifted it

            but those pages are present in this 1966 version.&nbsp;
            Naturally, the content might have changed a little from 1966
            to 1972, but I don't think you're going to find a better
            discussion of the topic anywhere in our document library, or
            elsewhere, at the present time.&nbsp; These documents came
            from the Mortimer family collection (thanks, Ken!) and the

            What's important is that these are basically "theory of

            that's just speculation at the moment, and so we may or may

                time, when men were men, women were women, and what
                today seem like relatively small downloads then seemed
                like freakingly huge ones.&nbsp; Ah, 2003, will you ever
                come again?&nbsp; At any rate, so-called comedy aside,
                back then I tended to put a little note next to each of
                the hyperlinks to show how many megabytes were in each
                document file.&nbsp; Well, times have changed, at least
                as far as download sizes are concerned, and those
                quaint, old notes warning you about 4MB or 5MB downloads
                now just seem silly now that many of our downloads are
                hundreds of megabytes.&nbsp; Besides, 90% of the newer
                additions to the library no longer had notations like
                that anyway.&nbsp; So I've just bit the bullet and
                removed all of the old notations about download sizes

              Using Flight Program LUMINARY (Rev. 116)</a>" (600 pages),
            for the Apollo 12 LM, seems <i>quite</i> significant.&nbsp;
            According to its preface, "The purpose of this document is
            twofold.&nbsp; The first is to provide a functional
            description (operationally oriented) of the LM GNCS hardware
            and software and the interfaces with other spacecraft
            systems.&nbsp; The level of detail is that required to
            identify and define telemetry outputs. Also included are
            function flow diagrams of the LUMINARY programs and routines
            together with lists of verbs, nouns, option codes, and
            checklist codes for this flow. The second purpose is to
            provide the operational procedures for this hardware and
            software including nominal airborne condensed checklists,
            malfunction procedures, and program notes."</td>

          <td valign="top">I got a complaint that the VirtualAGC GUI
            program wouldn't fit on a 800×480 7" Raspberry Pi
            touchscreen.&nbsp; No kidding!&nbsp; Well, that's part of a
            larger problem with it, it appears, in that while the
            program was attempting to interrogate the screen size and to
            adjust it user-interface format appropriately, that feature
            doesn't seem to have been working.&nbsp; So I've addressed
            both of those problems in the latest source-code updates in
            the GitHub repository.&nbsp; Instead of trying to make
            adjustments according to the screen size, the VirtualAGC GUI
            program now depends on command-line options:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>--radio-buttons — For the largest display screens
                (with, say, 1024 pixel rows).&nbsp; Mission selection is
                the "traditional" way, via radio buttons in the user
                interface.</li>
              <li>--dropdown — (The default.)&nbsp; For smaller display
                screens (with, say, 720 pixel rows).&nbsp; Mission
                selection is in the newer way, via a drop-down list.</li>
              <li>--squish — For the smallest display screens (with,
                say, 480 pixel rows).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For use with --squish only, there's also a --maximize
              command-line option that maximizes the program at startup.<br>
            </p>
            <p>There are no installers for this new program version as
              of yet, but I'll get around to it sometime if I hear no
              complaints in the meantime.<br>

                notable addition to the collection, because we
                previously had no final version of the descent
                procedures specific to Apollo 11, and the procedures in
                this document differ from those cobbled together from
                the closest alternatives (Apollo 12 procedures or
                preliminary Apollo 11 procedures).&nbsp; This
                information is necessary, for example, in making
                simulated Apollo 11 landings in NASSP that are faithful

            the document library, one sponsored and scanned by Mike
            Stewart (thanks Mike!), and one cleverly found in the NTRS

            of the two is a study (in 3 volumes), the "Flight Program
            Language Requirement" document, of the feasibility of
            replacing the LVDC assembly-language version of the LVDC
            software with versions in 4 different programming
            languages.&nbsp; As a part of this effort, large chunks (but
            not 100%) of the pre-existing LVDC software were actually
            ported to those 4 alternate languages, as well as being
            flowcharted and described in detail.&nbsp; Thus, though this
            document does not provide any LVDC code at all, it
            nevertheless provides much more internal detail about the
            LVDC software, in almost-usable form, than any other
            documentation presently available.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it

              for producing documentation for this website, starting
              from logged AGC i/o-channel data from NASSP, but I suppose
              it could be useful for other folks as well.&nbsp; Also,

3D-printed





















              DSKY with integrated Raspberry Pi running yaAGC</a> that
            I've mentioned obliquely a couple of times in the last few
            of days, I had been asked to provide some sort of a facility
            for playing back pre-scripted AGC output-channel commands
            ... i.e., for controlling the DSKY from a script rather than
            from yaAGC, for things such as museum exhibits.&nbsp; So I
            added a primitive recording and playback capability to that
            DSKY program, which is called <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/piDSKY2.py">piDSKY2.py</a>,
            it being a Python 3 script rather than the classic yaDSKY
            program.&nbsp; Having done that, I began to wonder where the
            heck anyone would actually get a meaningful script to run on
            the thing, since what you'd really want is realistic data
            from an actual mission simulation, rather than something
            recorded while just playing around with yaAGC and a
            DSKY.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The answer to that, it seemed to me, was to see if NASSP
            could log data about AGC-to-DSKY output-channel transactions
            or if not, could someone add it for me?&nbsp; Well, Nik Beug
            was kind enough to not only pep up NASSP's logging
            capabilities to meet my needs, but also to send me the log
            for a sample mission segment, namely an Apollo 8
            launch.&nbsp; So with a slight amount of work throwing
            together a little <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/convertNasspLog.py">Python
script





















              for converting Nik's NASSP log format</a> to the format I
            needed, I now had the ability to "play back" an Apollo 8
            launch on the 3D DSKY.&nbsp; Yay, and thanks Nik!&nbsp;
            Hopefully we'll have a lot more of these scripts in the
            future. <br>
            <br>
            Now, unfortunately, not everybody is going to be able to
            have one of the 3D-printed DSKYs, so my next thought was
            this:&nbsp; Why not modify yaDSKY2 so that it can play back
            these scripts?&nbsp; So ... now it can!&nbsp; The way it
            works is that if you click on yaDSKY2's PROG indicator lamp
            with a mouse, you get a file dialog that allows you to
            choose a canned script for playback.&nbsp; Naturally, I've
            added this to <a

              introductory list of various fun things you can do with a

            programs to do stuff the AGC was never intended to do.&nbsp;
            As if I could write anything "simple"!&nbsp; This is
            prompted by the introduction onto the market of functional
            3D-printed DSKY look-alikes with integrated Raspberry Pi
            computers running Virtual AGC.&nbsp; It should probably be
            called an <i>iDSKY</i>.&nbsp; With units such as that,
            there seems to be a lot more interest in having the DSKY do
            cute stuff that's not necessarily directly AGC related than
            there is in pepping up the pure software simulation.&nbsp;
            Probably because there's more of a motivation to get value
            for your dollar, since the physical devices are costly while
            the software simulation is entirely free.&nbsp; <i>My</i>
            take on that is that it's fine to subvert the normal
            functionality of the unit, but that it should be implemented
            by writing programs in AGC assembly language to do it!&nbsp;
            (Well, I have my ideas about it, and nobody is forced to
            agree with me.&nbsp; :-) )&nbsp; At any rate, this is my
            attempt to encourage that.&nbsp; The new page is nowhere
            close to being complete, but I think it has enough on it to

            determining what's supposed to happen to data to/from the
            AGC's input/output channels.&nbsp; The basic motivation is
            that this might be a good way to throw together physical

            concern oneself with C++ or cross-platform graphical

                Programming Manager) wrote, trying to capture how the
                software development process worked, but there's a lot
                of extra detail about associated matters that I hadn't
                seen before as well.&nbsp; I suppose I must have left it
                in the to-do list because it was just a "draft".&nbsp;

              <li>2012 — Dave Roberts sent word of the problems he was
                having with his hardware Block II simulator, a number of
                which pointed to bugs in yaAGC, particularly in the DV
                instruction, and sent a lot of descriptive material and
                even code demonstrating/fixing the problem ... the <i>same</i>
                problems Mike Stewart had later with his Block II
                simulator, and was gracious enough to fix directly in
                yaAGC over the course of the last year.&nbsp; But Dave
                was first, and I let him down by parking him on the

          <td valign="top">The good NASSP folks have been making an
            effort lately to get our AGS (abort computer) simulation
            integrated into NASSP, and into checking it out, which is
            great!&nbsp; What Ryan Callaway in particular found was that
            while a lot of stuff worked, a lot of stuff didn't work
            either.&nbsp; Mike Stewart jumped right in and managed to
            find a bug I had made in the AGS simulator, yaAGS.&nbsp; So
            Ryan now reports that it "looks like all phases of
            rendezvous work as advertised in lunar orbit. I used AGS
            calculations for every part and ags controlled burns as well
            with RR and PGNS as backup/basis of comparison" and "the AGS
            aborts the LM beautifully in both DPS and APS aborts".&nbsp;
            Which is not to say that yaAGS necessarily is 100% perfect
            now, but this one fix has improved its behavior
            tremendously.&nbsp; For now, you have to build the software
            from source if you want this fix, and it hasn't migrated
            into the installer packages for VirtualAGC yet.&nbsp; Great
            work, guys!<br>

          <td valign="top">I was recently contacted by an graphic artist
            who was doing a project that involved the binary patterns
            used to encode characters, specifically in the word
            "APOLLO", who wondered what the appropriate binary encoding
            of these characters, easily recognizable by a 1960's
            engineer, would have been in the Apollo era?&nbsp; I told
            her to use EBCDIC encoding.&nbsp; Then, in a rare fit of
            humility, I passed the question along to Hugh Blair-Smith as
            well.&nbsp; Hugh also said that EBCDIC was the appropriate
            answer, but then speculated about a separate matter:&nbsp;
            Is it possible to actually display the word "APOLLO" (or
            more accurately, "APOLO") directly on the DSKY itself?&nbsp;
            As you may recall, the DSKY was used to display <i>only</i>
            numbers and blanks, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible
            for appropriate software to display other patterns as
            well.&nbsp; Alas! it turned out not to be possible; none of
            the characters A, P, or L can be displayed.&nbsp; In fact,
            we ended up tracing through the DSKY's electrical schematics

                development time-frames, number of changes in each of
                the flight versions of the code, etc.&nbsp; The
                "amazing" part is the description of the amount of
                AGC-software related material sent to the
                now-unfortunately acronymed ISIS over the years —
                magnetic tapes of software, 10,000+ records of

                Rev 1 as we've been claiming all these years, and as
                documentation suggests, or was it LUMINARY 99 Rev 2 as
                Jim Kernan (the original "rope mother" for the Apollo 11
                LM software) says?&nbsp; The hope was that AP11ROPE
                might help resolve this question, given that it was
                printed long after Apollo 11 (namely, in 1970) and
                purports to be the mission code.&nbsp; Thus if AP11ROPE
                were identical to <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Luminary099">our
LUMINARY





















                  99 Rev 1 code</a> it would support the notion that Rev
                1 was the one that flew, whereas if it were identical to
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/LUM99R2">our
recreated





















                  LUMINARY 99 Rev 2 code</a> (or at least relevantly
                different from Rev 1) then it might support the notion
                that Rev 2 is the one that flew.&nbsp; Well,
                octal-for-octal, it turns out that AP11ROPE <i>is</i>
                identical to LUMINARY 99 Rev 1.&nbsp; But it is not
                source-code identical; it appears to have been branched
                from LUMINARY 99 Rev 0 (not Rev 1) and then modified to
                bring it up to date with Rev 1, but not with identical
                program comments.&nbsp; That being the case, it doesn't
                really imply much about whether Rev 1 or Rev 2 was used
                in the actual mission.&nbsp; But it did turn out to be a
                nice, clean, easy-to-OCR scan, that should be very easy
                to use to route out lingering program-comment errors in
                our transcriptions.</li>

                Thanks, guys!&nbsp; Recall that ZERLINA is an "offline
                development" program that had been maintained by Don
                Eyles for experimenting with different types of
                improvements or fixes to LM software, and that AP11ROPE
                is actually a different printed copy of (we believe) the
                Apollo 11 LUMINARY 99 program we've already had for the
                last 10 years.&nbsp; But we're not <i>quite</i> sure
                yet that AP11ROPE and LUMINARY 99 are exactly the
                same.&nbsp; So we're going to check that (of course!),
                as well as to use it to cross-check yet again the
                existing transcription of LUMINARY 99. But there's no
                need to do a full transcription of AP11ROPE, unless we
                find out it's actually different in some way.&nbsp; A
                transcription of the AP11ROPE octals will be done,
                though, as part of the cross-checking process.&nbsp;
                ZERLINA, of course, we <i>will</i> be fully
                transcribing to source code, as well as creating an
                executable binary of it for the AGC simulator, starting

                and in archival higher-resolution (larger size) JPEG

                June-or-later.</li>
              <li>A bug in the SUNBURST 37 octal listing (whose release
                was mentioned on 5-27, see below) has been fixed.&nbsp;
                This was a marvelous and instructive typo in that it was
                a <i>single-digit error</i> that nevertheless did <i>not</i>
                cause a checksum error at runtime.&nbsp; That's because
                of an ambiguity in the checksumming system built into
                the AGC code:&nbsp; the checksum of a memory bank must
                be equal to either the bank number or else the negative
                of the bank number.&nbsp; In this case, the error was in
                memory bank 1, and the single error (in which the octal
                was off by 2) flipped the bank checksum from +1 to
                -1.&nbsp; This is a very rare type of error, but it's
                unfortunate that the system had that ambiguity.</li>
              <li>And speaking of checksums, it turns out that over the
                course of time, the algorithm used by YUL to generate
                the memory-bank checksums changed slightly.&nbsp; Prior
                to SUNBURST 116, I'm told, only the positive memory-bank
                values were used, but after that it was not always
                possible to generate the positive memory-bank values,
                and thus checksums for negative memory-bank values were
                generated when required.&nbsp; yaYUL has thus been
                modified with an appropriate new command-line switch to
                enforce this difference, allowing the removal of an
                annoying workaround in AURORA 12.&nbsp; (The assembly of
                both AURORA 12 and SUNBURST 37 are affected by this; the
                older RETREAD 44 has no checksums anyway, and so is not
                affected.)</li>
              <li>And speaking of annoying workarounds, the annoying "<tt>SBANK=</tt>
                workaround" has finally been eliminated!&nbsp; One of my
                more-irritating failures in writing the yaYUL assembler
                originally is that I was unable to figure out the scheme
                used by YUL/GAP to generate the so-called "superbank"
                bits in various address-generating pseudo-ops; in cases
                where the values of the superbits were actually
                important to the execution of the program, the bits
                generated by yaYUL were fine, but where they did not
                affect the execution, they were often wrong, and thus
                the code generated by yaYUL did not match the octals
                generated by YUL or GAP in those cases unless a handful
                of extra <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops that weren't
                originally present in the assembly language code were
                inserted into our source code.&nbsp; Personally, I
                simply threw up my hands in disgust with it, deciding to
                live with these extra <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops, but
                over the years several people have worked on incremental
                fixes and removal of <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops, never
                with full success.&nbsp; Certainly, getting the original
                source code for YUL helped out a lot.&nbsp; However,
                over the weekend, the problem seems to have been
                cracked, and the entire AGC code base, including all
                code versions that we have, now assembles to the proper
                octals, entirely without any extra <tt>SBANK=</tt>
                pseudo-ops at all.&nbsp; There seem to have been several
                insights that contributed to this breakthrough.&nbsp;
                Two stand out to my mind.&nbsp; One is that if you
                actually look at a page of an AGC program listing (say,
                <a href="ScansForConversion/Luminary210/0059.jpg">page
                  57 of LUMINARY 210</a>), you may notice (<i>I</i>
                never did!) that there's a mysterious notation like <tt>E<i>n</i>
                  S<i>m</i></tt>, under the page numbers in the upper
                right-hand corners of the pages.&nbsp; These turn out to
                be the memory-bank bits (including superbank
                assumptions) that YUL/GAP <i>thought</i> applied at
                that point; this observation gives a lot more visibility
                into what YUL is thinking at any given point.&nbsp; The
                other observation that stands out is that the
                assumptions made by YUL for these bank bits changed at
                some point (between SUNBURST 37 and 120), so that a
                slightly different rule (and a different yaYUL
                command-line switch) applies to earlier code versions
                than to later ones.&nbsp; Great work, guys!</li>
              <li>Not only that, but the transcription of SUNBURST 37
                source code is now complete, though I suppose I should
                admit that some of the comments in the code haven't been
                full proof-read for typos, so</li>

                flying simulated Apollo 5 and Apollo 14 missions, in
                spite of the fact that we don't presently have any (CM
                or LM) of the Apollo 14 software, and that while we have
                the Apollo 5 (LM) software we don't have the necessary
                pad loads for it.&nbsp; It turns out that the <a

                developers have worked out tricks to create the pad
                loads for Apollo 5, and to modify the Apollo 15 CM and
                LM software's ephemeris data for Apollo 14, allowing

            all other AGC versions, I had instead simply locally
            reposted the PDF from our Internet Archive collection,
            thinking that it was "good enough".&nbsp; In other word if
            you followed the links on <a
              href="Luminary.html#Sunburst37">our Luminary page</a>,
            you'd probably end up downloading this supposedly-fine PDF.
            Well it <i>wasn't</i> good enough, so ... my
            apologies!&nbsp; The PDF has weird artifacts in which some
            characters were frequently replaced by other characters,
            such as 'D' in place of 'O'.&nbsp; Whatever the reason for
            this weird effect, it's obviously intolerable, so if you
            follow through the links to our locally-posted
            reduced-quality images <i>now</i>, you'll now find
            individual JPG pages.&nbsp; The <i>high-quality</i> images
            in our Internet Archive collection don't have this strange
            problem, and so can be used without fear, but I definitely
            would not recommend using the PDF found there. <br>

            As a corollary, we now realize that Emerson was wrong, and
            that a foolish consistency may <i>not</i> be the hobgoblin
            of little minds, if the effect of that consistency is to
            enforce a tried-and-true method rather than succumbing to
            untested novelties without having a good reason to do so.<br>

            37 is now available, scanned for our Internet Archive

            As you may recall, SUNBURST 37 (also known as SHEPATIN 0) is
            an early version of the SUNBURST program, never used for any
            mission, though SUNBURST 120 was used later in the LM's AGC
            in the Apollo 5 unmanned mission.&nbsp; Like RETREAD and
            AURORA, SHEPATIN is another "missing link" in the AGC
            software's evolutionary development.<br>
            <br>
            As usual, we'll be producing an octal file for this (so that
            SHEPATIN can be run in the AGC simulator) as well as
            source-code files (so that we can do nice searching on it,
            have syntax-highlighted listings, and so on), but that will
            be a process that takes a bit of time.&nbsp; Right now, all
            we have is the scanned pages.<br>

            I've departed from my usual practice of providing local
            low-resolution JPG page images here at our main website, and

            lower size" version of the scanned page images.&nbsp; (The

            some anomalous behavior that I hadn't noticed before.&nbsp;
            I think this may stem from the fact that in the VM releases
            I've made so far, a fairly old version of Midori is being

            changes to the landing code, and the fact that it used

I'll





















                write it up and generate Windows and Raspberry Pi
                installers after I'm more comfortable with the changes.
                The main change relates to the fact that we've now got
                so many different AGC versions available that the app's
                main window had become too big to display screens
                smaller than about 1280×1024. For screens smaller than
                that, the app will now automatically change the format
                so as to make its main window a lot smaller.&nbsp; This
                works well for displays down to around 800×720 (if there
                is such a thing), but for anything smaller than that
                you'll still be out of luck.&nbsp; You do lose the
                capability of running your own "custom" AGC software
                from the smaller-screen version of the GUI.&nbsp; The
                changes are just to the VirtualAGC GUI, and not to any
                of the simulations, so there's still no guarantee that
                you can fit an entire simulation onto a smaller screen.<br>

            Skylark" document, divided into parts for size reasons,

            specific to Skylark 48, which we currently believe is the CM
            AGC program used for Apollo-Skylab (and <i>possibly</i> for
            Apollo-Soyuz, though we really don't know).&nbsp; Since we
            don't actually have any source code for Skylark so far, and
            since the "Programmed Guidance Equations" are a kind of
            pseudo-code description of the source code, I guess this is
            the next-best thing to having the Skylark program

              <li>AGC CPU-simulation features:&nbsp; As you may know,
                the AGC had the ability of being able to execute a
                different instruction (stored in the B/BRUPT registers)
                upon return from an interrupt-service routine (ISR) than
                was stored at the actual address at which execution
                resumed afterward.&nbsp; In other words an ISR could
                load the binary value of the instruction it wanted
                executed upon return into the BRUPT register, and even
                though the RESUME instruction would cause the program
                counter to be loaded correctly, the binary instruction
                in BRUPT would be executed, irrespective of the value
                stored at the RESUME'd program-counter address.&nbsp;
                This was originally not a "feature", but was simply a
                consequence of the fact that the next instruction to be
                executed is always decoded by the AGC during the
                execution of the <i>preceding</i> instruction, and thus
                the decoded next instruction needed to be stored
                somewhere during an ISR, and subsequently restored after
                the ISR had been completed.&nbsp; Considered as a
                "feature", this is rather useless for ISRs, since all it
                can really do is crash the program or do something else
                that's unpleasant, but <i>could</i> be useful for
                something like a software-controlled interrupt, such as
                the EDRUPT instruction.&nbsp; The EDRUPT instruction,
                seemingly created for Ed Smalley's AGC self-test code,
                though possibly never used by him at all, was not
                something that was really needed for anything, but was
                instead created (as Hugh Blair-Smith has said) "because
                he could".&nbsp; At any rate, while I originally
                intended to implement this same behavior in the AGC CPU
                simulator, it caused difficulties for me ... and since
                it didn't seem to be used anywhere in the Luminary 131
                AGC code I originally worked with, I simply disabled the
                feature entirely rather than try to figure out how it
                was misbehaving.&nbsp; In other words, for all these
                years, yaAGC has simply been ignoring whatever is in the
                B/BRUPT registers.&nbsp; At any rate, Mike Stewart, in
                his unswerving quest to make yaAGC work <i>correctly</i>
                as opposed to well-enough, and to agree in its behavior
                with the Block II hardware simulation, has now debugged
                this behavior and fully restored B/BRUPT/EDRUPT.&nbsp;
                All known self-test software related to this behavior
                works correctly, yaAGC does agree with the hardware
                simulation, and the restored code has been tested
                multiple times in the NASSP Command Module and Lunar
                Module simulations.&nbsp; In short, B/BRUPT and EDRUPT
                are back, baby!&nbsp; Many thanks to Mike Stewart and
                the NASSP gang.</li>

                <li>Updated the VirtualAGC installer (again!), not only
                  for Ubuntu (for the VirtualAGC VM), but also for
                  Raspberry Pi.</li>
                <li>We once again have an installer for Windows as
                  well.&nbsp; I discontinued this some time ago because
                  it was such a hassle for me to maintain, but it's back
                  ... at least for now.&nbsp; As far as the Mac is
                  concerned, well that's still too, too much for me to
                  keep up with, so the installer for that is still
                  discontinued, and not likely to be reinstated.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Updated the VirtualAGC VM, which is really what I'd
                  prefer the casual user to use.&nbsp; While for the
                  most part the old VM could simply be updated with the
                  Ubuntu VirtualAGC installer mentioned above, there are
                  a number of other niceties I've changed, and not
                  handled by the installer, such as:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added Code::Blocks visual-debugging links to the
                    desktop for many more AGC versions.</li>
                  <li>Eliminated the password entry associated with the
                    screen-saver, which I hadn't realized was enabled.</li>
                  <li>Replaced of the Firefox web-browser by the Midori
                    web-browser.&nbsp; While I don't expect anybody to
                    really be web-browsing from the VirtualAGC VM, the
                    web-browser is used by VirtualAGC for presenting the
                    AGC source code, and Midori is insanely faster than
                    Firefox at doing this, as well as being less
                    memory-hungry and disk-space hungry.&nbsp; So using
                    Midori is a win-win-win.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>It is perhaps notable that the use of installer
                  programs as such for the VirtualAGC package has now
                  been discontinued, and what I'm calling "installers"
                  are really just compressed archives of type "tar.xz",
                  which the user must manually uncompress.&nbsp; There
                  is some slight loss of ease for the user, in that
                  desktop icons and start-menu entries are no longer
                  created automatically.&nbsp; But there are compelling
                  reasons behind this move.&nbsp; The principal
                  motivation is that a tar.xy archive tends to be about
                  half the size of one of the old installer programs
                  (currently 20MB vs 40MB), <i>and</i> it's much easier
                  from a system-maintenance standpoint as well.&nbsp;
                  Thus, updating the "installers" more often becomes a
                  more-attractive proposition.<br>

              <li>I've noticed for some time that there's a problem when
                I add lots of documents to the document library, because
                there's really no way to tell at a glance what has been
                added recently, and what has been there for a long
                time.&nbsp; I'm trying out adding an icon <img
                  src="new.png" alt=""> next to recent additions to the
                document library, with a notation at the top of the
                document library page telling what time-frame the icon
                is associated with.&nbsp; Right now, for example,
                everything added in March of this month (or presumably
                later if there is a later) is marked.&nbsp; We'll see
                how well it works.&nbsp; I've seen all too many sites
                where once something gets marked as "new", it may
                continue to be marked as "new" for years and years ...
                and obviously, that's not very helpful.&nbsp; At any
                rate, this only applies to the document library page,
                and not to the website in general.<br>

              <li>Don Eyles has sent over a few reports of <a
                  href="links.html#Software_Control_Board_Meeting_Notes">Software
Control





















                  Board meeting notes</a>, now in our document
                library.&nbsp; Yes, I know, exceedingly dull,
                right?&nbsp; Well, not exactly!&nbsp; As you may recall,
                we recently added a series of <a
                  href="links.html#LUMINARY_Memos">LUMINARY Memos</a> to
                the document library ... an effort which is only about
                half-completed so far, by the way.&nbsp; One virtue of
                these LUMINARY Memos was that <i>if complete</i>, they
                could be used to track all AGC software changes, so that
                we could get a much-better understanding of the changes
                from (say) Luminary 99 to Luminary 116 to Luminary 131
                to whatever.&nbsp; Of course, the LUMINARY Memos aren't
                entirely complete, either in their coverage of events,
                nor in our collection of them.&nbsp; Well, the SCB Notes
                have a similar virtue, again if complete, in that they
                provide much the same information about software
                changes.&nbsp; Moreover, since in theory <i>every</i>
                software change had to be approved by the SCB, there
                shouldn't be as much of a completeness problem in the
                notes themselves, though obviously we have every bit as
                much of a problem in the completeness of our collection
                of them.&nbsp; In the case of SCB notes, though, they
                don't track changes like Luminary 99 → 100, but rather
                changes like Luminary 1B → 1C.&nbsp; This still ends up
                giving us the mission-to-mission changes, even if not
                the fine-grained revision-to-revision changes.<br>

              <li>It has been pointed out to me that the document
                library contained a few of the missions' technical crew
                debriefings, but that several more were missing though
                available elsewhere.&nbsp; So for the sake of
                consistency, the Apollo 12, 13, 14, and 16 technical
                crew debriefings have been copied from the <a

                D'oh!&nbsp; If only I had a dollar for every time I had
                had to fix that over the years.</li>
              <li>The recent Users' Guide documents from Don Eyles,
                mentioned over the last couple of updates, turn out to
                have a handful of foldout pages which were getting
                messed up in the conversion of the document to
                PDF.&nbsp; It has taken me several tries to get right
                (the problem being, apparently, that pages with aspect
                ratios more-extreme than 2:1 don't work right in the
                PDF), but I now have PDFs that I think are fully
                working.&nbsp; The fix to the PDFs has messed up those
                pages in the online viewer in our Internet Archive
                collection (sigh!), but the foldouts still legible
                there, and I'm willing to live with that.</li>
              <li>I've been chided for making it appear that the
                recently-added Programmed Guidance Equation documents
                from Don Eyles, for Luminary 1B and 1C, mentioned a few
                days ago, weren't very useful.&nbsp; That's a fair
                criticism, so I've modified my comments.&nbsp; While it
                is true that I think calling these documents the
                "Guidance Equations" is misleading, it would also be
                true that better titles for them would be "Pseudo-Code
                Descriptions of Luminary 1B" and "... 1C".&nbsp; And
                that, of course, can make them <i>very</i> valuable for
                someone trying to comprehend the Luminary 1B and 1C
                programs.&nbsp; As Don said when he gave them to me,
                "Now, you know, <i>we</i> [AGC developers] didn't ever
                use these documents; they were written afterward for <i>other</i>
                people" (or words to that effect, anyway).&nbsp; But <i>we</i>
                are the "other people" in this little scenario, so while
                these documents may not be so important for Don, they
                may indeed be very important for us.<br>

              <li>A few weeks back, original developer Jim Pennypacker
                had sent me his copy ("#1") of one of the
                Instrumentation Lab documents that we had only
                previously had a mutilated copy of ("#114"), namely

                  Strapdown Computations</a>".&nbsp; While I had scanned
                the darn thing at the time, and uploaded the
                archival-quality scans to our Internet Archive
                collection, I had failed to replace the old, bad version
                in our document library.&nbsp; D'oh!&nbsp; Well, I've
                done it now.&nbsp; It's an interesting concept that
                never made it into an actual spacecraft, but well-worth
                reading about.<br>

              <li>Niklas Beug has made another video to supplement his
                previous Apollo 11 lunar landing simulation video (using
                Orbiter/NASSP/VirtualAGC/Luminary99), namely an Apollo
                15 simulated lunar landing (using
                Orbiter/NASSP/VirtualAGC/Luminary210), and I've linked
                it at a couple of a strategic locations.&nbsp; Here's <a
                  href="https://youtu.be/E301HplyA7A">a direct link to
                  YouTube</a>.&nbsp; For my taste, it's a lot more
                exciting than the Apollo 11 landing (minus the 1201/1202
                alarms and the boulder field at the very end of the
                Apollo 11 landing, of course), since you get to swoop in
                over the mountains; Nik indicates it's his favorite
                landing site as well.&nbsp; As far as it being a
                favorite landing site is concerned: I don't know if it
                depicts a real event or not, but the Apollo 15 episode
                of <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i> dramatizes Dave
                Scott as arguing for this Hadley-Apennine site (vs a
                "safer" landing site) in the decisive site-selection
                meeting, presenting the argument that it's worthwhile
                exploring beautiful places.</li>
              <li>I've done a lot of cross-version checking of our AGC
                source code (Luminary 69 vs Luminary 99 vs Luminary 116
                vs Luminary 131 vs Luminary 210; Colossus 237 vs
                Colossus 249 vs Comanche 55 vs Artemis 72; and Luminary
                99 vs Comanche 55), which has not only found various
                lingering errors (mostly look-alikes such as '0'⇆'O',
                '1'⇆'I', '.'⇆',', and so on), but more-importantly,
                insures consistency across AGC versions, hence reducing
                spurious "changes" for anybody who is interested in
                detailed tracking of changes from one AGC version to the
                next.&nbsp; Consequently, I've updated <a

              <li>Don Eyles has sent me a box of huge Instrumentation
                Lab and MSC documents, many of them 800-1200 pages,
                which I have scanned and uploaded as archival copies to

                the Internet Archive a week or so to process them all,
                and it is only after they've done so that we'll have
                nice, compact PDFs with text-search, that can be
                conveniently read, and which I would feel comfortable
                putting into our document library.&nbsp; (Yes, it's
                shocking, I know, but the Internet Archive has better
                software for processing PDF files than I do!&nbsp; Who

                  The document itself says it should be used in

                  this case, Apollo 12 Lunar Module, and specifically
                  Luminary 116), and my characterization of it is that
                  it is a more-detailed, mostly-textual description of
                  the various objects (specifically variables) appearing
                  in the software than can be found in the program
                  comments themselves.&nbsp; In other words, it doesn't
                  superficially appear to have much to do with "guidance
                  equations", though admittedly it has &gt;1000 pages,

          <td valign="top">Lately, there has been some confusion as to
            whether the Luminary 99 source code we have been providing
            is actually the code that flew in the Apollo 11 LM or not,
            due to AGC developer Jim Kernan's recollections that there
            are three different revisions of that particular code
            (Luminary 99, Luminary 99 Rev 1, and Luminary 99 Rev 2), and
            the only version we actually have is Luminary 99 Rev
            1.&nbsp; Well, on the balance of the surviving evidence,
            what we currently believe is that Luminary 99 Rev 1 did
            indeed fly in Apollo 11, but also that Jim's recollection is
            correct and that there's a Rev 2 that is "better" in a
            certain way, but which didn't fly.&nbsp; But we have no
            physical printout for Rev 2.<br>
            <br>
            The explanation is that the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris">ephemeris</a>
            data in Rev 1 is wrong, but not <i>very</i> wrong, and
            certainly good enough for a lunar landing.&nbsp;
            Nevertheless, we know what the correct ephemeris should be,
            because it's identical to Apollo 12 and 13, so to celebrate
            that fact, we've artificially <i>recreated</i> <a
              href="listings/LUM99R2/MAIN.agc.html">Luminary 99 Rev 2</a>
            for you, as a mashup of 99 Rev 1 and Luminary 116, and we
            provide <i>both</i> Rev 1 and Rev 2 for you.&nbsp; You can
            view the source code or simulate either one to your heart's
            content.&nbsp; You can take your pick.&nbsp; It's called
            "choice", friends!&nbsp; We've named Luminary 99 Rev 2 <a
              href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/LUM99R2">"LUM99R2"
in





















              the GitHub source tree</a>, because that's what Jim's
            story says he called it, way-back-when.<br>
            <br>
            We have also received new information about where a program
            listing for Comanche 44 exists.&nbsp; Comanche 44 did not
            fly on a mission, but Comanche 45 Rev. 2 (which is 2 months
            younger) flew in the Apollo 10 command module, so if we can
            get our hands on Comanche 44 some day, it may be the closest
            thing we'll ever have to Apollo 10 Command Module
            software.&nbsp; At any rate, the Colossus page has been
            updated with this info.<br>

              <li>Proofing of Luminary 131 comment text (vs our new scan
                of the program listing) is finally complete.&nbsp; The
                proofing data has also been uploaded (see <a

                link to the proofing data), in case you suddenly have an
                urge to double-check it.&nbsp; The comments in the
                source code undoubtedly still have quite a few errors,
                but after the transcription effort for Luminary 116 has
                been completed, I intend to do a 3-way check of it vs
                Luminary 99 and 131, which should eliminate quite a few
                of the remaining errors.&nbsp; This actually means that
                all of the fully-transcribed AGC source-code versions
                have now been completely proofed in their comment text,
                albeit not all to the same standards, due to differences
                in printout- and scan-quality.</li>
              <li>As usual, the proofing of Luminary 131's comments
                revealed various corresponding errors in the source code
                for other AGC versions, and those errors have been fixed
                as well.&nbsp; Consequently, there have been quite a few
                updates (not the least of which is Luminary 131 itself)
                in <a href="listings/">the colorized,

                time, this is naturally a huge help.</li>
              <li>There are a number of memos that give us more insight
                into what Zerlina is doing, and how.&nbsp; You may
                recall that Zerlina was an experimental program,
                branched from Luminary, and used to experiment with a
                number of new approaches.&nbsp; Furthermore, we will be
                obtaining Zerlina within the next few months, and going
                through our usual process of transcribing it into source
                code and running it in the AGC simulator.&nbsp; So it's
                nice to have some idea of what we can expect it to be
                doing.<br>

                AGC scans, we've been hosting <i>just</i> the
                low-resolution imagery.&nbsp; The higher-resolution raw
                data from the scans has existed only on my own personal
                computers and backups, though you could have gotten it
                from me if you asked for it.&nbsp; Well, that situation
                has changed, and I've now uploaded all of the raw scan
                data to our Internet Archive collection.&nbsp; Now, I'll
                have to admit that, archival format or not, the visual
                quality is still rotten in comparison to the new scans,
                because I didn't understand things like white-balance
                settings when I took the pictures.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
                all of you (rather than I alone) now have access to the
                best-quality imagery available.&nbsp; Furthermore, in
                the future, I'll also be doing the same with any image
                files sent to me or that I personally scan.
                Incidentally, since AGC listings are <i>big</i>
                documents in comparison to what the Internet Archive
                normally handles, the initial processing on them may not
                yet be complete on all of these uploads if you rush over
                there right this instant to look at them; if the initial
                processing isn't complete, only the actually-uploaded
                data (gigantic PDFs 250MB-1.5GB in size) will be
                immediately accessible.&nbsp; After the processing is
                completed, you also have a convenient online flipbook
                viewing interface, a zipfile of JPEG2000 page images,
                and a more-compact PDF with searchable text.&nbsp;
                Solarium 55 is definitely ready for viewing at the
                moment I'm writing this, and the others should gradually
                become available over the next few days.&nbsp; Documents
                I end up scanning but which turn out not to be suitable
                for Virtual AGC proper, will simply remain in the
                Internet Archive collection; for example, you'll find <a
                  href="https://archive.org/details/MSC07857">a Shuttle
                  document</a> there that I happened to scan while
                scanning some AGC-related documents.</li>
              <li>I've also been busily correcting all of the metadata
                for the scans hosted in our Internet Archive collection,
                since we hadn't initially provided very good data at the
                time archive.org was making the scans.</li>
              <li>Three new documents pertaining to Apollo 4, 5, and 6
                have been contributed by AGC developer Jay
                Sampson.&nbsp; (Refer to the Sunburst 120 section of the
                Luminary page, and the Solarium 54 and 55 sections of
                the Colossus page.)</li>
              <li>Original AGC developer Jay Sampson has convinced us
                that the AGC versions used for these two missions
                (Solarium 54 and 55, respectively) are in fact <i>identical</i>
                though assigned different build numbers.&nbsp; In other
                words, we in fact have the AGC source code for Apollo 4,
                even though we didn't know we had it.&nbsp; I won't
                proclaim that discovery in a big box just yet,
                though!&nbsp; You can read the explanation in <a
                  href="Colossus.html#Solarium54">the Solarium 54 entry
                  on the Colossus page</a>.</li>
              <li>Original AGC developer Peter Volante has sent me a
                variety of organization charts for the Instrumentation
                Lab's Apollo development, which help to show how the
                organization evolved over time, and how the people
                within it moved around.&nbsp; I've added them as
                complementary to the list of developers gleaned from the
                AGC source code, in <a

              <li>I forgot to mention it, but proof-reading the program
                comments in Artemis 72 (Apollo 15-17 LM) has now been
                completed, and the improved source-code files have been
                available in our GitHub repo for a few days.&nbsp; The
                quality of the scan or the printout from which the scan
                was made was pretty poor, though, so there are likely to
                be more errors remaining than in many of the other AGC
                versions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there's a great
                improvement.</li>
              <li>We have had Luminary 131 (Apollo 13 LM software)
                scanned from a copy in Don Eyles's possession.&nbsp;
                Old-timers here may recall that the availability of a
                Luminary 131 scan was what enabled this entire Virtual
                AGC project in the first place, back in the day, and
                without it, none of this mighty empire of AGCosity would
                exist at all.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there's no getting
                around the fact that that original scan was miserable in
                quality, barely legible, and practically a study of how
                a scan of a color document shouldn't be.&nbsp; In fact,
                many of the errors in AGC program comments I mentioned
                above, and have been mentioning for the last several
                months, stemmed originally from that very unreadability,
                but the new scan will now be used to finally eliminate
                those errors from our Luminary 131 source-code
                files.&nbsp; So we're lucky that we now have a really
                great scan.&nbsp; Check it out in our <a

          <td valign="top">As I mentioned a few days ago, our scan of
            the 1971 simulation of the Apollo 11 landing leaves somewhat
            to be desired in terms of the readability of the text ...
            it's just too light for comfortable reading, because the
            printout was too light.&nbsp; Thus, to compensate for that,
            I had provided a highly-processed B&amp;W PDF that is
            much-more readable.&nbsp; Well, I've now done some
            additional processing on the color images, to enhance the
            readability to the best of my admittedly-meager abilities,
            so I've posted the reprocessed <a

              images</a> as an additional alternative.&nbsp; They're not

                almost but not quite impossible to find.&nbsp; But
                better late than never!)&nbsp; We've dubbed this program
                "Super Job" because of the markings on it, though it's
                hard to believe that Raytheon actually called it

          <td valign="top">As you may have seen in the notes made here
            over the last few months, I have been in the process of
            proofing and correcting the comment text in the various
            source-code transcriptions we have made of the AGC program
            listings available to us.&nbsp; Hitherto, we had no
            efficient way to do this, but had developed a tool for doing
            so that worked quite well on most of the of program
            listings, with newer scans tending to work much better than
            older ones ... hence in doing this proofing, I found myself
            working backward in time, progressing from the latest AGC
            scans to the earliest, finally reaching the <i>original</i>
            scans with which the Virtual AGC project started, namely
            Colossus 249 (Apollo 9 CM) and Luminary 131 (Apollo 13 LM),
            as well as the somewhat-later Artemis 72.&nbsp; The scans
            (or the associated printouts from which the scans were made,
            or the destructive OCR processing done on them) for Colossus
            249 and Luminary 131 are <i>so</i> bad that the "efficient"
            proofing tool cannot be applied at all, while Artemis 72 is
            highly questionable.&nbsp; Thus, a different and more
            time-consuming proofing process was required.<br>
            <br>
            I have just completed proofing Colossus 249, and the results
            are available in GitHub now.&nbsp; What has been done with
            it is to note that Colossus 237 (which preceded it
            chronologically by a short time), and Comanche 55 (which
            followed it chronologically) had already been proofed using
            the "efficient tool".&nbsp; A 3-way side-by-side "diff"
            between the transcribed source code from these three AGC
            program versions was done.&nbsp; This highlighted places
            where errors (many, many errors) <i>might</i> exist.&nbsp;
            An extremely-large number of errors was corrected in
            Colossus 249 in this way, along with a (much smaller) number
            of errors that lingered in the already-proofed&nbsp;
            Colossus 237 and Comanche 55.<br>
            <br>
            This proofing process also benefited from the availability
            of an alternate scan of Colossus 249, not available
            originally, but available nowadays from the collection of
            AGC developer Fred Martin.&nbsp; Thus, many parts of the
            original scan that were garbled to the point of
            illegibility, could now be filled in with absolute
            certainty.<br>
            <br>
            More than you wanted to know, probably, but having just
            finished it, I'm still excited about it!&nbsp;
            :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            A similar 3-way proofing of Luminary 131's comment text
            awaits availability of comment-proofed source-code Luminary
            116 and Zerlina (derived from Luminary 145), neither of
            which is available now, but both of which are expected to be
            available within a few months.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for
            Artemis 72, the <i>last</i> Colossus version, there is no
            prospect of a 3-way diff with predecessor and successor
            versions, but merely a 2-way diff against a predecessor
            version that may not be a closely-related as we would hope,
            so it will probably come last of all.&nbsp; But we'll see
            what we'll see.<br>

            The licensing on all of the pages has also changed, from
            what (in the U.S.) would have been an implicit copyright by
            me (Ron Burkey), with all rights reserved, to <a
              href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">a
              Creative Commons No Rights Reserved license</a>.&nbsp;
            This is equivalent to being in the Public Domain in the
            U.S., and is the closest equivalent to that in parts of the
            world where the concept of the public domain is not
            recognized.&nbsp; I learned this from something Nina Paley
            wrote in connection to her marvelous animated film, <a
              href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/">Sita Sings the
              Blues</a> ... which, if you've not seen it, you
            should!&nbsp; She had originally released it for free under
            the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike License, which
            already was unbelievably brave, but still had the effect of
            reserving some legal rights for herself.&nbsp; But she later
            concluded that since she knew she wasn't going to sue
            anybody for breaching the license anyway, what was the point
            of reserving any rights?&nbsp; So she simply changed the
            licensing in the same manner I am doing now.&nbsp; (Of
            course, I don't claim to have to have the guts she does,
            since I derived no financial benefit from this website
            anyway, so the licensing is irrelevant to my checkbook.)<br>
            <br>
            Comparably gutsy to Nina's film is Kimiko Ishizaka's release
            of her piano renditions of Bach's <a
              href="http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/download">Goldberg

            her later recordings of Book I the Well-Tempered Clavier or
            the Art of Fugue, though Wikipedia claims that the
            Well-Tempered Clavier has indeed been released to the public
            domain as well.&nbsp; Kimiko is a German-Japanese, former
            Olympic bronze medalist in powerlifting, and concert
            pianist, which is pretty interesting in itself.<br>

                  Luminary 131</a> scanned material which we started
                with, way back in 2003, as well as the <a
                  href="ScansForConversion/Colossus249-Martin/">
                  improved replacement Colossus 249 scan we made of Fred
                  Martin's program listing</a>, has been completely
                restructured so that it conforms to the same pattern as
                all of <a href="ScansForConversion/">the other scanned
                  AGC program listings</a>: i.e., it now consists
                entirely of PNG files, one per each page numbered by the
                original assembler, and no PDF files at all.&nbsp; A
                side benefit is that while the original print/scan
                quality has naturally not improved, the quality of the
                images we're providing has nevertheless improved anyway,
                whilst decreasing the actual file sizes.&nbsp; At the
                same time, page-number references in the <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Colossus249">
                  Colossus 249</a> and <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Luminary131">
                  Luminary 131</a> transcribed source-code files, which
                previously corresponded to the PDF page-numbers in the
                gigantic now-irrelevant all-in-one PDF files downloaded
                from the now-defunct History of Recent Technology
                website, have been changed so that (like all other AGC
                source-code listings) they correspond to the page
                markings on the original printed pages of the program
                listings.&nbsp; My motivation for all of these changes
                is that I intend to begin proofing the comment text in
                the Colossus 249 and Luminary 131 source-code files by
                cross-comparing them with similar AGC versions like
                Colossus 237, Comanche 55, and Luminary 99; that kind of
                cross-checkout would have been greatly hampered without
                the changes.&nbsp; Moreover, if we manage to get Don
                Eyle's Luminary 131 listing (<a href="volunteer.html">which
we





















                  don't yet have a sponsor for</a>, by the way), the
                checking that that scan would enable would also have
                been hampered.&nbsp; However, even without such
                motivations, the overall effect of the changes is still
                to make the Colossus 249 and Luminary 131 material
                better and more accessible.</li>
              <li>I guess I've forgotten to mention <i>any</i> of the
                newspaper, magazine, or online articles in 2016 in which
                our Virtual AGC project played an important role.&nbsp;
                Of course, I don't necessarily know about all of them,
                since I don't spend a lot of time scouring the web for
                news about the project or about myself.&nbsp; The
                best-known is probably the article titled <a
href="https://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule/">"BURN,





















                  BABY! BURN! The code that took America to the moon was
                  just published to GitHub, and it’s like a 1960s time
                  capsule"</a> at Quartz.&nbsp; That one was fun for me,
                because various people stopped me or telephoned me to
                say "hey, is that you?"&nbsp; But for my taste, the
                article which has just appeared in the current issue of
                the U.K.'s <a href="http://www.slow-journalism.com/">Delayed





















                  Gratification magazine</a>, called "Houston, we have a
                program", is a lot more fun, for a number of
                reasons.&nbsp; Not least is that the article is really
                about our Virtual AGC project, rather than being
                primarily about Apollo 11 or the AGC software for Apollo
                11.&nbsp; But also, I think the article is extremely
                well-structured and entertaining, much more so than the
                endless, detailed blathering I output by the ton here at
                our website, so it's a fun read.&nbsp; I congratulate
                the writer, Chris Bourn, for the care he took, and the
                results he achieved.&nbsp; You may notice I've provided
                no link to the article, though.&nbsp; That's because
                Delayed Gratification is a print-only magazine,
                supported by subscribers rather than ads.&nbsp; They
                only put a handful of sample articles online; perhaps
                ours will some day be one of those (I hope!), but
                perhaps not.&nbsp; The magazine itself has a very
                intriguing concept: it is a proponent of something
                called "slow journalism", which is basically a throwback
                to the old days when journalists were supposed to do
                thorough fact checking, editors were supposed to edit,
                and so on, as opposed to today's situation, in which
                articles are thrown together as quickly as possible
                (probably by cutting-and-pasting unsubstantiated
                material), in order to maximize online ad revenue.&nbsp;
                In contrast, Delayed Gratification boasts that it is the
                <i>last</i> to break a story, rather than the <i>first</i>
                to do so. There's also an interesting TED talk about the
                concept of slow journalism:</li>

              <li>I had forgotten over the years that our digitized
                Luminary 99 (Apollo 11 LM software) was actually missing
                almost an entire page (bottom of p. 1472 and top of p.
                1473).&nbsp; Of course, we had immediately
                reverse-engineered this when we were transcribing the
                source code, and knew that our reconstruction assembled
                to the correct octal values, but it would still be nice
                to have the "correct" version.&nbsp; Fortunately, Don
                Eyles was able to supply snapshots (now on <a
                  href="Luminary.html">the Luminary page</a>) from his
                own printout.&nbsp; Gratifyingly, though not
                surprisingly, the reconstruction was 100% accurate,
                including the comments.&nbsp; (Actually, there was a
                typo in the comments, but ignore that; it was 100%
                perfect <i>in principle</i>.)</li>

                sort of family-tree diagram for a while, in which the
                relationships amongst the various AGC programs were
                covered ... but only up to Apollo 11.&nbsp; I've taken
                it upon myself to recreate that diagram, and extend it
                all the way to the end of Apollo, by which I mean
                Apollo-Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz.&nbsp; It's a rather
                impressive picture, including even the science-project
                ZERLINA program, which was outside the main
                developmental flow; though even then, I'm told there
                were many other such separate programs, such as
                DIANA&nbsp; (about which I have a little info but not
                enough to include it in the chart), AMELIA, and so on.</li>

              <li>The program-comment text (but not white space) of
                Luminary 99 (Apollo 11 LM AGC program) has now been
                fully-proofed and corrected in GitHub, though
                undoubtedly errors remain.&nbsp; (Recall the update of a
                few days ago that Aurora 12 and Sunburst 120 had already
                undergone this correction process.)&nbsp; Because so
                many changes are involved, the proofing data (for
                Luminary 99, but not yet for Aurora 12 and Sunburst 120)
                has also been <a

                (note that it's a 115MB download), for anybody
                interested in the proofing process, or perhaps
                performing additional proofing passes.&nbsp; There will
                be an upcoming article on our GitHub wiki regarding

                needs to be "compiled" with the command "oct2bin
                --no-checkums &lt;Retread44.binsource" to actually get
                the executable rope image), and in theory can be run in
                the AGC simulator.&nbsp; However, Retread 44 precedes
                the use of embedded checksums, and hence we cannot <i>yet</i>
                be as certain about the correctness as we normally would
                be at this point in the process, so I won't dignify this
                announcement by putting it in a fancy box.&nbsp;

                ... not just for concise coverage of that issue, but for

                <li>While in the past (and continuing into the future!),
                  we've taken great pains to insure that the functional
                  source code and executable versions of the AGC program
                  versions we present here are 100% accurate, we've had
                  no tools at our disposal and much less luck at
                  insuring that the <i>comments</i> in these programs
                  are accurate transcriptions from the original.&nbsp;
                  This situation has changed somewhat, and we do in fact
                  have a proofing tool at our disposal now that makes
                  proofing the program comments both much more efficient
                  and much more reliable, for those program versions to
                  which it can be applied.&nbsp; I will write much more
                  about this in the future, but for right now I'll
                  merely note that SUNBURST 120 (Apollo 5) and AURORA
                  have already been through this process, with around
                  1000 errors fixed in AURORA and around 3000 fixed in
                  SUNBURST.&nbsp; COMANCHE 55 (Apollo 11 CM) is about
                  halfway through this process (according to GitHub
                  logs), and while I've lost count at the moment, I
                  think the errors fixed in its comments already top
                  5000.&nbsp; It should be noted that these fixes affect
                  only the <i>text</i>, without regard to the columnar
                  alignment (which will hopefully be addressed in the
                  future).&nbsp; Most of these fixes are trivial
                  matters, such as the presence or absence of a '.', so
                  the huge numbers of fixes aren't necessarily alarming
                  as it seems superficially.&nbsp; The goal is for the
                  program comments in our source-code files to exactly
                  match the original assembly listings, right down to
                  misspellings and typos.&nbsp; These improvements are
                  currently available in GitHub, and will continue to
                  become available as the process progresses.</li>

                  page</a>, and updating them, since many of them are
                nearly a decade out-of-date.&nbsp; The old instructions
                are still preserved as a link to a separate page.&nbsp;
                However, the executive summary is that as of right now,
                it's really, really hard to build Virtual AGC on Mac OS
                X, Solaris, and FreeBSD, and in fact we no longer know
                how to do it. (But Windows and Linux are still okay,
                though for Windows you do need all of the latest fixes
                in the <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc">GitHub
                  repository</a> for it to work!)<br>

                Of course, I announced the AURORA 12 rope nearly a month
                ago, but for some curious reason failed to emphasize it
                as I normally do for new AGC versions, so I'm doing that
                now.&nbsp; In fact SUNBURST 120 has been available for a
                few days as well, though I forgot to update this
                change-log. In both cases, you still have to explicitly
                build the rope from the corresponding "binsource" file —
                "oct2bin &lt;Sunburst120.binsource" or "oct2bin
                &lt;Aurora12.binsource" — (with the rope being
                oct2bin.bin afterward), but you can do that and run
                either or both in yaAGC if you're of a mind to do
                so.&nbsp; In both cases, the source-code transcription
                is making progress, but isn't yet ready, so this is the
                only option if you want to run one of these programs
                right now rather than waiting for full availability. </div>

                to be working before.&nbsp; Thus, yaYUL (and I think,

                course, there are aspects of the test suite that aren't

              <li>Lately I've been keeping all website changes at <a
                  href="https://virtualagc.github.io/virtualagc/">the
                  GitHub version of the website</a>, and not pushing

                  (main) ibiblio version of the website</a>, because
                ibiblio overrides the character-set encoding; thus, some
                of the characters (like '—', 'μ', '±', etc.) were messed
                up on the ibiblio version but not on the GitHub version.
                I finally figured out how to override ibiblio's
                override, so I should be able to start pushing changes
                to ibiblio.org/apollo again.</li>
              <li>I've added a short section to <a
                  href="LVDC.html#Interaction_with_the_AGC">the LVDC
                  page</a> describing the interaction of the AGC with
                the Saturn rocket.&nbsp; The highlight is a nice video
                created by Riley Rainey which you might enjoy watching.</li>
              <li>The hopefully fully-correct Aurora 12 rope is now
                available at our GitHub repo, though the transcribed
                source code for Aurora isn't yet available, so at least
                theoretically you can run Aurora in the AGC
                simulator.&nbsp; However, that would have to be done
                from yaAGC's command line, since Aurora 12 capability
                has not yet been integrated into the VirtualAGC GUI
                program.</li>
              <li>Niklas Beug has been developing a new feature for us,
                which is found in <a
                  href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/tree/scenarios">
                  the "scenarios" branch of our GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp;
What





















                these scenarios are "core dumps" — exact copies of the
                AGC's "erasable memory" — with the appropriate pad loads
                and setups for running simulations of various mission
                scenarios. These core dumps are accompanied by nice
                writeups of what they are and how to use them. By
                loading the core dump into the AGC simulator, you're all
                set to go with the corresponding scenario!&nbsp; At the
                moment, there are only 4 scenarios, namely the Apollo 9,
                11, and 15 launch scenarios and the Apollo 7 rendezvous
                scenario (and yes, that's a real thing!), but presumably
                the number will grow.&nbsp; Eventually, this feature
                will be integrated into the VirtualAGC GUI program, but
                for now it's command-line only.&nbsp; Also, the setups
                come from NASSP, so you may find it more fulfilling to
                use them with NASSP then with "pure" Virtual AGC.<br>

            At least, they were long-awaited for <i>me</i>, because
            until today I saw them for the first and last time almost 12
            years ago to the day, and that's why there's no hair left on
            my head.&nbsp; (That's my theory, anyway.)<br>
            <br>
            But also, on a separate note, it has slowly dawned on me
            that I don't have AGC electrical schematics on our
            document-library page.&nbsp; I thought I did, but I
            don't!&nbsp; (No wonder I can never find them.)&nbsp; The
            Block II schematics, as contributed by Eldon Hall, have been
            on the klabs.org site for many years, but since NASA no
            longer funds it, that site is unfortunately now essentially
            a zombie and one wonders how much longer it will
            persist.&nbsp; So as of today, I'm now mirroring all
            relevant AGC material from that site here, in <a
              href="links.html">our document library</a>.&nbsp; The
            highlights of the additions are:<br>

                Blair-Smith, Ray Alonso, and Eldon Hall (as well as
                Frank O'Brien, Cline Frasier, and Jose Portillo Lugo) at
                the MAPLD '04 conference.</li>
              <li>Various new documents or cleaner versions of ones we
                already have, most-notably perhaps, an Apollo 16 Delco
                manual to supplement the existing A15 Delco manual, and
                a clean replacement for the mutilated-but-indispensable

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It also seems that there may be a perception on the part
              of the AGC modeling community, if there is such a thing,
              that the available Block II AGC schematics are so
              incomplete that constructing a hardware Block II AGC sim
              is impossible.&nbsp; (That's why, I've been told, everyone
              continues to do Block I sims.)&nbsp; Well, Mike Stewart
              has certainly made a Block II sim that's good enough to
              help him track down and fix bugs in our own software sim,
              so while the Block II schematics may not be perfect, they
              are certainly not so incomplete as to prevent using them
              for this kind of project.&nbsp; And here are Mike's links
              to prove it:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <div> <a
                  href="https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_hardware">https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_hardware</a><br>

            </blockquote>
            As it happens, Mike has given me his evaluation of the
            completeness/incompleteness of the Block II AGC schematics,
            and I provide that assessment in the document library as
            well, for anyone interested in this kind of thing.<br>

                    simulator has incorporated our AGC simulator for

                    begun trying to do lunar landings with it and have

            It is, unfortunately, unclear if the code can ever be run in
            the AGC simulator or not, but I'll think about it for a
            while before saying "no".<br>
            <br>
            Second, and perhaps more importantly even though I haven't
            chosen to color it red, I was wrong in one very significant
            way about Francois Rautenbach's extractions of the
            rope-memory contents, and that is that it was <i>not</i>
            from Apollo 6 (<b>Solarium 055</b>) as I said, but rather is
            the <b>Corona</b> program from the AS-202 ("Apollo 3")
            mission, which we do not have already, and have no other
            prospects for acquiring.&nbsp; Moreover, it is simply in the
            form of stored electrical waveforms rather than a file of
            numbers representing the values stored at various memory
            locations.&nbsp; But perhaps it could be converted, and
            perhaps the <b>Corona</b> binary can be reverse-engineered
            back into the form of source code, which we will do if at
            all possible and present it here.&nbsp; So stay tuned.<br>

                changes to the corresponding missions on the Luminary

                that Solarium 055 was for Apollo 6 and Solarium 054 was
                for Apollo 4, which means that I have been in error for
                the last 7 years in saying that Solarium 055 was for
                Apollo 4.&nbsp; This has entailed numerous website
                changes (I don't guarantee I've caught all of them yet),
                as well as in the source code for Solarium 055 on GitHub

                as source-code files and independently-generated binary
                files in 2010.&nbsp; However, proofing of the
                source-code files and of the binary were never completed
                at that time, though the binary was proofed to the
                extent that all checksums ("bugger words") were
                correct.&nbsp; As of today, <a

                  completely-proofed binary, Solarium055.binsource, is

                to the 2010 binary, in the sense no octal values needed
                to be corrected, but can now be regarded as
                "correct".&nbsp; The next step is to add the capability

                both this feature and the Google Search bar updated

            updating this site, and so have a pretty large backlog of
            stuff to deal with that people have sent me and that has
            just been sitting on my to-do list.&nbsp; Sorry about
            that!&nbsp; First, a status report:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>I've <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
                  bold;">not</span> completed the process of porting the
                Gemini catch-up and rendezvous simulation program so
                that it can be run in a modern machine-independent
                Fortran.&nbsp; The problem (aside from my general
                laziness) is that the program does some stuff very
                specific to the IBM 704/7090/7094 which I don't
                understand, and therefore don't understand how to
                port.&nbsp; If there's anyone with the time and energy
                (or shockingly, the expertise) to handle this, I'd be
                grateful.&nbsp; Alternatively, there's a generally
                available simulator for that IBM computer system, and
                getting the program running on the simulator would also
                be a very interesting alternative.</li>

                Uvebrandt and Jim Lawton), the Apollo 8 code (Colossus
                237) is almost ready for use, but not quite.&nbsp; It
                just requires some effort from me to close the gap and
                get it working.&nbsp; Keep your fingers crossed on this
                one.</li>
              <li>Helmuth Litfin has created software which he calls the
                "Ultimate DSKY Simulator", which (surprise!) is intended
                to be a DSKY simulation that is accurate in terms of
                physical dimensions and appearance, and more accurate in
                terms of behavior than my yaDSKY program.&nbsp; For
                example, in terms of the former, the Ultimate SDKY would
                appear on your computer screen with the same physical
                dimensions as a real DSKY.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the
                simulator is Windows-only and is not open source, and
                I'm not aware of it being presently available for use,
                so I can't actually give you a link to it; but I have
                seen a preliminary version almost (but not quite) worked
                with yaAGC.&nbsp; This is significant because the brief
                evaluation did reveal certain flaws in the behavior of
                yaDSKY, which Helmuth has explained to me in terms of
                the DSKY schematics, and therefore will probably have to
                be fixed at some point.&nbsp; The flaw relate
                principally to the DSKY's "standby" mode, and the manner
                in which the DSKY enters or leaves standby mode.&nbsp; I
                can't promise a time-frame for the fixes.&nbsp; If
                anybody is interested in the meantime, I can relate the
                details to you.<br>

            Now for other contributions and communications:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A couple of years ago, Fabrizio Bernardini did a
                presentation on the AGC (in Italian), and was kind
                enough to provide English translations of the material
                he created.&nbsp; This pretty-extensive introduction has
                been added to our "<a href="ForDummies.html#Fabrizio">Kinder,
Gentler





















                  Introduction</a>" page.</li>
              <li>Also a couple of years ago, Dimitris Vitoris sent us
                an update to his <a
                  href="Pultorak.html#Dimitris_Vitoriss_Block_I_and_Block_II">physical
implementation





















                  project</a>, apologising that he was sending the
                update and thus adding to my workload at a time when
                there seemed to be an "explosion of activity".&nbsp;
                (Pretty ironic, right?)&nbsp; I've now added those very
                extensive updates.</li>
              <li>At the same time, Dimitris also sent along a number of
                photos of various things in his personal collection
                which may be of interest, including bits and pieces of a
                block 1 AGC and DSKY, an LVDC, and an RCA-110A
                computer.&nbsp; I've included those photos on the
                relevant pages.</li>
              <li>I've added a <a href="Gemini.html#Software_Examples">Gemini
OBC





















                  coding example</a> sent in by John Pultorak a couple
                of years ago.</li>
              <li>Added references on the <a
                  href="download.html#Downloads">download page</a> to
                alternate installation packages provided by Onno Hommes.</li>
              <li>Donna Polehn has create and IDE and Block I AGC
                implementations (both for an off-the-shelf FPGA board
                and a custom one), based on the Pultorak Block I
                AGC.&nbsp; I put the appropriate references to it on the
                <a href="Pultorak.html#Polehn">physical implementations
                  page</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            There's a lot more on the to-do list, but I'm to-done for
            to-day, and will hopefully get to them to-morrow.<br>

                that is really the complete FORTRAN source code used to

                behavior for the catch-up and rendezvous Gemini flight
                phases.&nbsp; Thus while we have no actual Gemini flight
                software at the present time, this is the next closest
                thing!&nbsp; Many thanks to Gene and to his son Dave for
                careful scanning of the document.&nbsp; Although I have
                not yet had time to do so, I expect to convert this

                72 (Apollo 15-17 Command Module) program listing has now
                been converted completely to source-code files, and has
                been debugged so that the assembled binary agrees with
                the octal listing from the hardcopy.&nbsp; The existing
                Artemis 72 binary that we have been providing since
                snapshot 20060110 was found to be in error, and was
                corrected in one place!&nbsp; The conversion to source
                was done by Hartmuth Gutsche, Onno Hommes, Jim Lawton,
                and Sergio Navarro, but Jim took it upon himself to
                perform the complete debugging of the source after it
                was created and I can attest that this is a large
                job.&nbsp; Kudos to all!</li>
              <li>Jim Lawton also seems to have single-handedly
                converted all of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Solarium</span>

                source-code files and octal.&nbsp; (Thanks, Jim!)&nbsp;
                We presently have no way to assemble the Block 1 source
                code in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>,
                so we don't yet have any way to verify the conversion;
                nor can we run the Block 1 binary in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> yet.&nbsp; But
                first things first.</li>
              <li>In a pathetic attempt to say "me too" in a soft,
                whimpering voice, I've begun creating a new assembler (<span

                OBC and Apollo LVDC source (if we had any).&nbsp; But it
                does nothing useful yet, so it's sheer bravado on my

              <li>John Pultorak has sent me a game pack for the
                AGC.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The pack includes a tic-tac-toe game
                (1 or 2 players) and a Simon game.&nbsp; I've included
                the games in the "Contributed" source tree, but there's
                presently no way to actually use them.&nbsp; There are
                two problems with trying to use it, and if anybody wants
                to fix them I'd be grateful:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The code is written in the syntax of John's
                  assembler rather than <span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">yaYUL</span>.&nbsp; There are several mods
                  needed, the principal one being that John's assembler
                  doesn't have the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
                  limitation of 8-character upper-case labels.</li>
                <li>Rather than directly accessing the DSKY via i/o
                  channels, the code assumes the presence of some
                  Colossus code (including the executive) to manage this
                  activity.&nbsp; Figuring out just what portions of
                  Colossus to prune away to get room for the games is
                  quite tricky.&nbsp; It was done this way because John
                  envisaged the game pack as an add-on to Colossus ... a
                  kind of in-flight entertainment system.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
                  However, for our purposes you could just as easily
                  eliminate all of the Colossus code and directly access
                  the DSKY.<br>

                have realized somewhat belatedly that it hasn't been

                that it was I was just keeping people from easily

                processing I'd like to do on the documents now being
                uploaded, such as making the text searchable and putting

                  support in production Win32 builds, and that seems to
                  take care of it.&nbsp; (I made no effort to disable <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">libreadline</span> in
                  native Win32 builds. )</li>
                <li>But then ... the <span style="font-weight: bold;">libreadline</span>-associated
problems





















                  I see on Linux (inability to use the backspace key,

                  prompt in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>)
                  have finally exasperated me too much.&nbsp; I've
                  disabled <span style="font-weight: bold;">libreadline</span>
                  support on all platforms until these unprofessional
                  irritations can be resolved.&nbsp; On some platforms
                  this causes loss of the ability to use the up/down
                  arrows to navigate through the command history, but I
                  can live with that.</li>
                <li>Found and corrected an arbitrarily-short command
                  line length in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">WinAGC</span>
                  utility I created to run and monitor the simulation in
                  Win32.&nbsp; The upshot of this is that when running a
                  very complex set of simulation options, such as
                  command-line debugging, the commands to start the
                  simulation might be truncated and fail, and so the
                  simulation would abort at startup.&nbsp; Hopefully
                  this won't happen now.<br>

              <li>The main GUI (<span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>),
when





















                allowing the user to choose a custom AGC/AEA source or
                binary file to assemble and/or simulate, now starts from
                the user's home directory (or whatever the equivalent is
                on an operating-system by operating-system basis) when
                the custom name is blank.&nbsp; It also doesn't allow
                directory-changes to bleed through between the different
                types of file-dialogs as it has been doing on some
                platforms.</li>
              <li>Custom AGC/AEA code in the main GUI (<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>):&nbsp;
                You were previously able to assemble source code and run
                from here, but you couldn't do symbolic debugging or
                browse the source-code listing.&nbsp; In other words,
                the main GUI is now almost a one-stop shop for assembly
                and command-line debugging.&nbsp; You still have to
                provide your own editor or, if you want GUI-based
                debugging in Code::Blocks (for instance), you still need
                to do some manual stuff outside the GUI.<br>

                  bold;">yaAGC</span> without a DSKY obviously doesn't
                do very much, though in theory you could still run and
                debug AGC code from a command line (if the iPhone has
                such a thing).&nbsp; Since I don't have an iPhone and
                haven't bothered as of yet to download an iPhone
                development kit it's an open question if I've properly
                implemented Alberto's changes, but at least it's a
                start.&nbsp; There are some instructions on the <a

              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> has
                been fixed so that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
                249 is identified with Apollo 9 rather than Apollo
                8.&nbsp; The good news here is that I am now expecting <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 237 (for
                Apollo 8) to actually be available soon, so we aren't
                really losing Apollo 8.</li>
              <li>The naming of all AGC source files has been changed
                from *.s to *.agc; that of all AEA source files has been
                changed from *.s to *.aea; that of all HTML files
                created from source has been changed from *.html to
                *.agc.html or *.aea.html.&nbsp; This has been done to
                play nicely with the AGA/AEA syntax highlighting which
                Google has been nice enough to add.&nbsp; I hope that I
                have tracked down all associated links on this website
                and fixed them, but I may have missed a few.&nbsp;

            It has been only partially proofed—less so than Comanche
            055—and so I won't feel great confidence until another
            proofing step or two has been done.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
            there's no reason (other than sad past experience) to think
            that it isn't okay as-is, as all of the memory-bank

                this.&nbsp; I would have sworn I had tested this after
                the last relevant change, but apparently did not.&nbsp;
                I promise you that with this snapshot I tried native
                builds in Linux, Win32 XP, Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 7.2,

                change has been made to be more consistent with Comanche

                continue to be produced, but the repository may contain
                more-recent data than in the snapshots.&nbsp; At some
                point in the future, once I become more comfortable with
                the repository, I may stop producing the source-code
                tarballs.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Onno Hommes forked the Virtual AGC source tree some
                time ago in order to make some extensive changes to the
                way debugging of AGC and AGS/AEA programs is done.&nbsp;
                These changes relate to the ability to use <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span> style commands
                rather than the command-set I had invented, and to
                integrate with GUI debugger front-ends such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>.&nbsp;
                In other words, Onno made debugging AGC programs a lot
                nicer.&nbsp; The source trees have now been
                re-merged.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                debugging has switched entirely to the new method, and
                the "classic" method previously described on the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> page has been
                eliminated.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                debugging is still undergoing change in this direction.</li>
              <li>When command-line debugging of AGC/AGS programs is
                being done, both <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now
                use <span style="font-weight: bold;">readline</span>
                style command-editing and command-histories on all
                platforms.&nbsp; I had been unable to provide this
                feature on several platforms previously.<br>
              </li>
              <li>There is now a native-Windows build procedure listed
                on the download page, again thanks to Onno.</li>
              <li>The FreeBSD native build procedure may or may not be
                broken.&nbsp; I can't tell, because I've broken my
                FreeBSD installation.</li>
              <li>I've reduced some 30-second startup delays I
                introduced in the last snapshot to 5 seconds.&nbsp; The
                delays were based on the worst-case characteristics of
                some very slow test machines I am using, but aren't
                necessary for more-normal computers.&nbsp; I've instead
                added some configuration instructions to the download
                page if someone should need the longer delays.</li>
              <li>The cross-build instructions given in previous
                snapshots were wrong, in that some aspects would work
                only if my username and directory setup were used.&nbsp;
                Hopefully this is fixed now.<br>

              <li>Dean Koska's YouTube demo of his Palm Centro port of <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> with his
                custom DSKY has been added to the homepage.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Configuration of the joystick for the ACA simulation,
                though simplified from previous times, was still
                annoyingly intricate.&nbsp; I've added small GUI program
                called <span style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> to
                hopefully simplify the configuration process and bring
                it a little closer to where it needs to be.&nbsp;
                There's a button marked "Handler" next to the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> checkbox
                that enables the ACA, and clicking the button calls up <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span>.&nbsp; <a
                  href="yaTelemetry.html#yaACA"><span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> usage is
                  fully explained</a> in the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaACA</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
                documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
              <li>I've also managed to fix the annoying characteristic
                of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> that
                it couldn't display console output in Windows, and thus
                you couldn't see the information you actually needed for
                the joystick calibration.&nbsp; But it still doesn't
                work in Windows in spite of that, because after its
                window loses focus it never sees any more joystick
                events.<br>
              </li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>
                program, which has a joystick driver based on <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span>, has been
                added.&nbsp; So there are 3 separate ACA simulations to
                choose from, and hopefully at least one of them will
                work for you.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>
                doesn't seem to work in Mac OS X (though I believe I
                recall that it did originally), so at least for now it's
                disabled there.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A lot of work has been done in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> to
                display digital-downlink data in a format that would
                more closely correspond to the way ground control data
                was displayed in actual missions.&nbsp; The associated
                display formats are designated by the names MSK-683,
                MSK-966, MSK-1123, and MSK-1137.&nbsp; However, I don't
                have it actually working yet, so the extra controls
                which have been added to <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaTelemetry</span> for this purpose are
                disabled and grayed-out at present.</li>
              <li>In the Mac OS X version, it hasn't previously been
                possible to run <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                or <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in
                debugging mode—and wouldn't have been possible to
                configure the joystick using <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">jWiz</span>—because of the lack of any
                command-line switches in the native <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Terminal</span> program and
                the practical inability to use <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">xterm</span> properly on
                the 10.4 and 10.3 platforms.&nbsp; Therefore, on the Mac
                platform we automatically include an open-source
                terminal program called <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Terminator</span>, which allows <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> to add back all
                of the missing functionality. It still isn't possible to
                use the debugger in 10.3, but it seems to be fine now in
                10.4 and 10.5.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Discovered (and fixed) that the endian conversions
                added previously to make symbol tables portable between
                Intel and PowerPC platforms weren't yet working.</li>
              <li>On the links page I've added a new document, the "<a
                  href="Documents/SMR-downsampled.tar.bz2">Saturn Ground
                  Control System Mathematical Subroutine Manual</a>".&nbsp;
Don't





















                get too excited, because it's not what you think it is:
                the "mathematical subroutines" are algorithms for
                multiplication, division, trig functions, etc.&nbsp;

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">I have had reports of the ACA
            (hand-controller) simulation not working on some versions of
            Mac OS X, so I have made a change.&nbsp; Instead of always
            using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
            simulation program (which superceded the earlier <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> simulation program
            for snapshots 20090331 and later), the <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI front-end
            now allows for using <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
            and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> somewhat
            interchangeably.&nbsp; Basically, it will use <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> unless it notices
            that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> has been
            configured, and then it will use <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">yaACA</span> instead.&nbsp; The <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> program has also
            been tricked up similarly to the <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">yaACA3</span> program in that it now automatically
            saves its joystick-related switches to a configuration file,
            so that they become the defaults at the next run. &nbsp; <a
              href="yaTelemetry.html#yaACA">Read about it in detail</a>
            if you have experienced a non-functional joystick.&nbsp;

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">I fixed the FreeBSD bugs
            mentioned yesterday, and am now willing to say that Virtual
            AGC works in FreeBSD.&nbsp; Instructions for building from
            source on FreeBSD have been added to the <a
              href="download.html#FreeBSD">download page</a>.&nbsp; I'd
            be lying, though, if I said it was thoroughly tested.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, I only have FreeBSD running in a virtual
            machine, and the marriage of FreeBSD (PC-BSD) to VirtualBox
            has not proved a happy one for me, so my ability to test the
            the FreeBSD installation is very crude.&nbsp; When I say
            Virtual AGC "works", I mean that I can run <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, that I can
            start the simulation, that I can put in verbs and nouns on
            the DSKY and it does what I expect it to do, that I can see
            telemetry downlinks, and that I can perform digital
            uplinks.&nbsp; If anyone wants to send me more data, I'd be
            happy to see it, but I've done all I expect to do on the
            FreeBSD side in the absence of feedback.<br>

            is concerned, various people have sent me interesting and
            useful stuff which I've added.&nbsp; I won't detail those
            things here, except to say "Thank you!" to Dimitris Vitoris,
            Mirko Mattioli, and Onno Hommes.&nbsp; Some important <span

            made to material on the the website itself, thanks to
            Fabrizio Bernardini:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>We now know with a higher degree of certainty that
                Luminary 1E build 210 was flown in Apollo 17 (and
                probably Apollo 15-16), whereas before there was some
                dispute that it might have instead been Luminary 1D
                build 209.&nbsp; This is significant in the sense that
                we're aware of a listing for 1D (and may even get a copy
                of it someday), but we're not aware of the existence of
                a copy of 1E.&nbsp; As to what the differences between
                1D and 1E are, that will await future revelations!&nbsp;
                Perhaps there are none.<br>
              </li>
              <li>We are now aware that AGS Flight Program 8 was used in
                Apollo 15-17, rather than in Apollo 14 as previously
                supposed.&nbsp; This is significant because we actually
                have a copy of Flight Program 8 included within the
                project, and it's good to know what we have!<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            Software-wise, lots of bugs have been fixed and auxiliary
            changes associated with those fixes have been made, so that
            I'm not even sure I remember them all.&nbsp; Here are some
            of the ones that stand out in my mind as particularly
            significant:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>There was an issue in sequencing key-releases with
                shifting of buffered keypad data in communications
                between <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA/yaDEDA2</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>,
                which could basically break AGS communications,
                requiring a reboot of the simulation to fix it.&nbsp;
                The effect was fairly repeatable if the HOLD key was hit
                and then the READ OUT key was hit.&nbsp; I *hope* it's
                fixed now.&nbsp; A new --debug-deda switch in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> helped me find
                this one.</li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> --debug
                modes were crippled using the as-distributed symbol
                tables for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>,
                because they embedded path names to the source-code
                files that were set at compile time ... in other words,
                for the symtabs I've been distributing, they pointed to
                source files in directories on <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">my</span> computer.</li>
              <li>Moreover, the symbol tables used the natural
                endianness of the CPU, meaning that symbol tables
                generated on an Intel architecture would not work if I
                distributed them to a PowerPC architecture.</li>
              <li>There was a bug in the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span> core-dump and --resume, in which
                half the time resuming from a core-dump would cause the
                DSKY to become non-responsive.&nbsp; My believe is that
                some state information (probably relating to interrupts)
                was not being saved in the core-dumps.</li>
              <li>I think there was a bug in direction flags
                (displacement direction of the control stick from
                detent) sent to the AGC by <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaACA</span> when more than one axis was
                displaced.&nbsp; The bug carried over into <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> (see below)
                as well, but I fixed it in both places.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            In terms of new features, again there are lots.&nbsp; Some
            of the more significant ones are:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> has
                also been given a capability not present in any software
                existing previously to the GUI, in that it can perform
                scripted Digital Uplinks to the AGC.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
                integrates AGC/AEA compilation and source-code browsing,
                in addition to merely managing the simulation.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> have been
                modified so that when in --debug mode they no longer
                output status messages like socket connections or
                disconnections of peripherals, thus giving an "easier"
                to understand debugging experience.</li>
            </ul>
            While it is basically a feature-neutral change, the ACA
            emulation program <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
            has been superceded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>,
            principally to allow the use <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">SDL</span> rather than <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">Allegro</span> for providing the joystick
            interface.&nbsp; The initial motivation for this was that
            Paul Fjeld (thanks, Paul!) advised that <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>'s joystick code was
            more stable than <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span>'s
on





















            Mac OS X.&nbsp; However, having made this replacement, I
            find some other significant advantages, the two principal
            being that there is far less configuration burden (and what
            configuration there is I've integrated in a way that won't
            be painful for <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>),
and





















            that I find I hadn't noticed before that <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> provides
            absolutely no console feedback on Windows, making debugging
            that much more painful.&nbsp; I've also taken the
            opportunity to use static linking for <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>, to avoid

            that conveniently ties all of the Virtual AGC bits and
            pieces together that were previously provided only
            incompletely and relatively unsatisfactorily through a few
            very simplified command-line scripts.&nbsp; I call this
            front-end program <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp;
This





















            program will additionally have convenient installers for
            Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, which is something which has
            been lacking up to now.&nbsp; At the same time, I've fixed
            the problem that (as previously installed by Virtual AGC)
            Stephan Hotto's <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
            module didn't have its various very-useful help screens.<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">The current development
            snapshot fixes a bug which has existed since 2007-03-16 in
            the development snapshots, but not in any of the binary
            downloads (since I've not posted new versions of the binary
            downloads in that time period).&nbsp; The bug, very simply,
            is that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
            module would abort if used in a CM simulation, even though
            it would work in an LM simulation.&nbsp; The upshot of this
            is that if you tried to start a CM simulation using any of
            the provided scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span>,
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249_lite</span>,

              style="font-weight: bold;">SimArtemis072_lite</span>) then
            the simulation would abort with an error message.&nbsp; I
            suspect that some folks have complained to me about this and
            that I blew them off with an explanation that there was
            something misconfigured about their computers.&nbsp; If you
            complained and I ignored it, I apologize.<br>
            <br>
            Development of Virtual AGC has been on hold for a while, but
            I expect it to pick up again soon, with a vengeance.&nbsp;
            (For everyone who has sent me stuff with which to update the
            website and it has seemingly fallen into a black hole, I'll
            finally be adding your updates!)&nbsp; So watch this space.<br>

                reason that LM_Simulator does not uses a real
                3-dimensional ball to show the attitude. Please keep in
                mind that the LM-IMU has its Gimbal Lock Condition on
                the Roll-Axis and not on the Yaw-Axis like the Command

              <li>A Checkbutton in the FDAI window now allows to switch
                off the 8-Ball for computers with low performance.&nbsp;
                [LM_Simulator's CPU performance has been greatly
                improved from a month or two ago, but you still might
                like to reduce it some, and updating the 8-ball is the
                majority of the CPU time used by LM_Simulator.&nbsp;

              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                now has its own RHC/ACA (Rotational Hand Controller) and

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> Stephan has sent another <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> update,
            which he describes as follows:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Now the FDAI shows the
              correct 8-ball angles - currently with a limitation to:<br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Yaw: 0Deg \B190Deg<br>
                Pitch: 0Deg \B190Deg<br>
                Roll: Anyway limited by the Gimbal Lock condition at
                0Deg \B185Deg<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              The functionality of the DAP and the dynamic model as well
              as the displayed FDAI angles can be verified by using the
              "Crew Defined Maneuver Routine V49". By initiating this
              routine you must provide the desired destination IMU
              Gimbal Angles, subsequently the AGC presents you with the
              associated FDAI angles it steers the LM to (please refer
              to the Tutorial). Because of the above mentioned
              limitation those FDAI angles should be in the defined
              range.&nbsp; [By the "tutorial", Stephan means the
              Contributed/LM_Simulator/tutorial.txt, which you'll get by

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> Here's a sort of omnibus
            update that takes into account stuff people have been
            sending me over the last year or so.&nbsp; I apologize to

The





















                AGC architecture allows for a wacky feature using the <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">BRUPT</span> register,
                in which an interrupt-service routine can place in
                instruction into <span style="font-family: monospace;">BRUPT</span>
                to be executed upon return from interrupt.&nbsp; In
                other words, the instruction executed upon return from
                an interrupt doesn't have to be the instruction that's
                at the location to which the program returns.&nbsp; I
                had implemented this feature, but couldn't figure out
                why anyone would want to do anything so crazy, and so
                disabled it by default.&nbsp; 'x15' of the group which
                has integrated Virtual AGC into the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span> spacecraft
                simulator has discovered that this feature <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">does</span> need to be
                activated for proper operation, as the multi-tasking
                performed by the program executive makes use of
                it.&nbsp; The effect of turning off this feature is that
                the digital autopilot will hit the dreaded <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">EDRUPT</span>
                instruction, and hence reset the AGC from time to
                time.&nbsp; Hence, it is now activated by default.&nbsp;
                (You can get this feature without a new download by
                compiling Virtual AGC with the command "make
                -DALLOW_BSUB".)<br>

                Hotto has sent in a major update, v. 0.8, that he
                describes as follows:</li>

            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>Critical Bug Fixes!!!</li>
              <li>Implementation of a precise RCS-Thruster simulation by
                using the transformation between the U,V and P,Q,R
                systems</li>
              <li>Complete rework of the IMU/FDAI which had errors in
                the coordination transformation between Pilot axes and
                Stable Member axes.</li>

                processor</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Additionally, Stephan tells
              us:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The DAP is now stable
                around all axes and even the "DAP V49 Crew Defined
                Maneuver" routine steers the LM exactly into the right
                orientation.<br>
                <br>
                There was a major bug in the IMU coordination
                transformation that caused the DAP instabilities.<br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, to handle single RCS jet events it was
                necessary to transform the U,V jet system into the P,Q,R
                pilot axes.<br>
                <br>
                The whole dynamical model of the LM is now based on the
                equations used for the DAP state estimator. This
                approach makes the model very precise and comparable to
                the real thing.<br>
                <br>
                To assure the right AGC initialization it is necessary
                to stick to the following pre-conditions and steps:<br>

                  LM_Simulator package has to be used because it is

                <li>After start of the simulation the following steps
                  have to be executed (please use the Tutorial as a

              <li>Mac OS X:&nbsp; Instructions by Fabrizio Bernardini
                have been added to the download page for installing the
                Virtual AGC binaries on Mac OS X 10.4.&nbsp; Some time
                ago I removed the instructions for installing binaries
                on Mac OS X, because it just wasn't any easier than
                building from source.&nbsp; However, it has apparently
                become much easier.<br>

            when manipulating the RHC.&nbsp; However, now that I am

                  separate commands each, one of which is a "fast" count
                  at 6400 counts per second, and the other of which is a
                  "slow" count at 400 counts per second.&nbsp; This
                  replaces the 800 count-per-second buffering used in
                  the 2005-10-05 snapshot.&nbsp; (But there's some doubt

                Provides a complementary feature to yesterday's <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> update,
                in that it internally buffers all PCDU or MCDU commands
                to the CDUX, CDUY, and CDUZ counter registers, and
                actually applies them to the counters at an 800 cps
                rate.&nbsp; In other words, the simulated IMU can feed
                in new angle measurements as fast as it likes, but they
                are now applied to the simulated AGC's internal counters
                only at an 800 cps rate.&nbsp; The reason for this is
                that the real IMU communicated with the real AGC using
                an 800 cps signal, and the digital autopilot (DAP) in
                the Luminary/Colossus software employs a digital filter
                based on this assumed counter update rate.&nbsp; The
                filter was intended to eliminate electrical noise and or
                noisy angles due to the vibration of the spacecraft, but
                it also has been causing rejection of changes to the
                CDUX, CDUY, and CDUZ counters that don't conform to the
                assumed 800 cps timing.&nbsp; Consequently, the
                simulated IMU has been feeding info on the spacecraft
                orientation to the simulated CPU, but the DAP has been
                rejecting this info.&nbsp; I don't claim that this
                change has been extensively tested, though, and an
                erasable pad load is needed to set the DAP's "Kalman
                filter" characteristics, or else the CDU inputs will
                continue to be rejected anyhow.&nbsp; (But I don't quite
                know what those pad loads are yet.)&nbsp; Thanks, as
                usual, to Stephan for figuring this out.<br>

                      ERRORS. This is the standard mode. The needles
                      show how far the DAP is away from the wished axes
                      positions.</li>

                      WITH RESPECT TO NOUN 22.&nbsp; Here the needles
                      display the absolute difference between the entry
                      shown by V16N22E and V16N20E. Normally used for
                      automatic positioning.</li>
                    <li>DSKY: V60E -&gt; DISPLAY VEHICLE ATTITUDE RATES
                      ON FDAI ERROR NEEDLES. These outputs should
                      provide the same information as the FDAI rate
                      indicators do. The Roll, Yaw and Pitch rate shown
                      by the FDAI bases on a separate Rate Gyro Assembly
                      fixed mounted to the LM body, whereas the
                      Information on the needles shown by V60E is
                      derived from the AGC measurement of the angular
                      changes. This is also a backup mode in case of a

                "ncurses" with a symbolic link making it appear to be
                "curses").&nbsp; Now documented in the build

A





















                lot of changes, thanks to Stephan Hotto.&nbsp; You
                should particularly note the changes to the tutorial (in
                the Contributed/LM_Simulator/doc directory).&nbsp;
                Here's what Stephan has to say about it:<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <ul>

                  IMU-Module</li>

                  <li>PIPA Vectors</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Gimbal Lock (Middle Gimbal) on LM-Z-Axis (Roll-Axis)</li>
                <li>Complete re-work of the RCS Thruster handling:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>4 Thruster Mode along X, Y, Z axes</li>
                  <li>2 Thruster Mode (Minimum Impulse Mode) along X, Y,
                    Z, U, V axes</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Remark: THC (Crew-Inputs) activates the correct
                  thrusters to translate the LM along the X,Y,Z axes.
                  This increase in speed is not jet reflected within the
                  IMU PIPAs.</li>
                <li>Update of the tutorial to reflect the DAP mode and
                  data load routines.</li>
              </ul>
              The summary of these changes is that for some time we've
              been trying to correctly match all of the various thrust
              and rotational axes of the simulation with the axes
              assumed by the Luminary and Colossus, and hopefully have
              them all correct now. However,&nbsp; the DAP is not yet
              stabilizing the LM even after loading the correct data
              (e.g. LM weight) as in the updated tutorial. It just
              bounces back and forth around the desired orientation,
              until it runs out of fuel.&nbsp; Obviously, we're still
              working on figuring that out!<br>

(Thanks





















                to Stephan Hotto.)&nbsp; The mapping of pitch/yaw/roll
                axes to thruster/joystick axes has been modified.&nbsp;
                The ATTITUDE HOLD mode thus now actually works (and
                attempts to hold the attitude) rather than merely
                allowing thrusters to fire.&nbsp; However, there is an
                overcompensation, so that the attitude overshoots,
                resulting in continual corrections and eventual
                exhaustion of fuel.&nbsp; This may be due to mismatch
                between the AGC's and IMU's assumptions about the LM's
                inertial characteristics.&nbsp; At any rate, it's a big
                improvement, but we haven't crossed the finish line yet.<br>

                <li>The current version of yaAGC has a mysterious
                  problem.&nbsp; I'm not sure when this problem
                  began.&nbsp; (I suspect the underlying problem was
                  always present, but that it was masked by other
                  problems in versions 20050814 and prior, so that it
                  was not noticeable.)&nbsp; The problem can be observed
                  as follows:&nbsp; Suppose you run <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary131</span>, then
                  you activate ATTITUDE HOLD mode, then you use the hand
                  controller to fire the thrusters.&nbsp; At some later
                  time, you'll find that the AGC has become largely
                  unresponsive, though it still responds in an automatic
                  way to certain stimuli.&nbsp; The only way of
                  recovering from this is to restart the
                  simulation.&nbsp; Fixing this problem is my top
                  priority at present.</li>

                has sent over a new version, differing principally in

                Christian Bucher has fixed an embarrassing bug for
                me.&nbsp; (For arithmetic with a double-precision
                negative value in which the less-significant word was
                +0, the more-significant word would have been
                arbitrarily converted to -0.&nbsp; Admittedly, I don't
                know if this situation ever occurred in practice, but
                it's great to have it fixed.)&nbsp; Also, Markus Joachim

                Apparently, we had been concentrating so much on <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s "--debug"
                mode, that we didn't notice that the regular (non-debug)
                mode had been broken for several days, and so the usual
                startup scripts like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>
                didn't work unless <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                was built without readline support.&nbsp; Jordan has now
                fixed this for us.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> &amp; <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>:&nbsp; Took
                care of some build-platform-specific dependencies in
                finding the 'curses' library sometimes needed with the
                'readline' library.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Win32</span> with <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span>:&nbsp; For
                those of you who think my Win32 build instructions seem
                too complex, Virtual AGC now seems to build with <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span>.&nbsp;
                (Warning:&nbsp; I haven't yet gotten the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span> library to
                install because I'm too lazy to follow the instructions,
                so I haven't yet tried <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
You





















                have to install a huge number of <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span> packages
                first, but fortunately that's really easy.&nbsp; For
                now, I'll just note that you use the Linux build
                instructions, and you have to do 'make NOREADLINE=yes",
                because for some reason Jordan's command-history stuff
                doesn't build.&nbsp; Also, the stuff for shutting down
                all of the components of the simulation gracefully
                doesn't work, so comment out the line reading "SimStop"
                in scripts like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>.&nbsp;
Finally,





















                the steps to running the simulation are to run "startx"
                from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span>
                command line, and then to run <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">SimLuminary131</span> or another startup script
                from the X-terminal.&nbsp; I'll write up the
                instructions for this in detail as I perfect it.</li>
              <li>Building, in general:&nbsp; Now have a much better
                technique, I think, for detecting the build-platform, so
                there's more consistency among the build-instructions on
                different platforms.<br>

                have sections 1-3, 5, and 7.)&nbsp; Section 7 is
                particularly interesting, because it documents and
                contains AGC assembly listings of all programs loaded
                into AGC erasable core memory rather than fixed core
                memory.&nbsp; In other words, these are the programs
                that were loaded into the "RAM" by the astronauts or via

                Jordan Slott has added a few fixes to the recent --debug
                mode features.&nbsp; Because of the fixes, 'readline'
                support is now enabled by default in the

                  This has been fixed.</li>
                <li>Repaired some spurious printing of prompts during
                  AGC program execution.</li>
                <li>"Break" was no longer working.&nbsp; This is now
                  fixed.&nbsp; [That was my fault, not Jordan's ---
                  RSB.]</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now
                  builds when readline support is enabled, and actually
                  works in Win32.&nbsp; In other words, you can get a
                  command history.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">Warning:</span>&nbsp; In Linux, <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> --debug mode
                  <span style="font-style: italic;">no longer functions
                    properly</span>, regardless of whether you compile
                  with or without readline support.&nbsp; Hopefully that
                  will be fixed Real Soon Now.&nbsp; (If you need
                  --debug mode in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                  under Linux or Mac OS X, please hold off on
                  downloading the development snapshot, since there are
                  no improvements in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                  anyhow.)</li>
                <li>There is also an issue with the prompt. When you hit
                  a breakpoint it does not print a "&gt;" prompt. You
                  can just hit "enter" to get a prompt.&nbsp; (Actually,
                  it <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> work

                Jordan has added some further frills to the --debug
                mode.&nbsp; Here are the notes on the changes:</li>
            </ul>
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>Added the "files &lt;regex&gt;" debugging command.
                This lists the source files matching the given regular
                expression.&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
              <li>Reworked the "break" command. Now "break *address" is
                used to add a breakpoint at a memory address, as in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>.&nbsp; The
                "break &lt;line&gt;" is used to break at a line number,
                whenever &lt;line&gt; can be parsed as an integer.
                Update "help break" to reflect this change.</li>
              <li>Improved the output from "breakpoints" a bit -- for
                those breakpoints specified using a symbol or a line
                number, it outputs the <span
                  class="moz-txt-link-freetext">file:line</span> from
                where it can be found. Note that I do not output <span
                  class="moz-txt-link-freetext">file:line</span> if you
                create a breakpoint using a memory address, although I
                don't think this would be difficult to do.</li>
              <li>Fixed a small bug in "list from,to" where the line
                numbers were not being displayed.</li>
              <li>Cleaned up some of my old code in symbol_table.c</li>
              <li>Added the ability to use libreadline to read in the
                debugger command line. The upshot is you get source file
                name completion, history, etc.&nbsp; (<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; Though
                apparently functional, this feature is currently
                disabled in the Makefile, because of some conflicts
                which prevent yaAGS from building.&nbsp; Hopefully it
                can be fixed up soon.)<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>Startup scripts:&nbsp; After performing some upgrades
                on my main Linux workstation, I found that the startup
                scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>,
                etc.) have become unreliable and may randomly shut down
                the simulation.&nbsp; (It's a problem in the
                relatively-recently-added feature that shutting down any
                component of the simulation, such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, shuts down
                all of the other components, such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>.)&nbsp;
                This should not affect Windows users, but potentially
                affect everyone else.&nbsp; I don't know how to fix this
                problem with any satisfying degree of certainty, but
                workarounds have been added that should reduce the
                probability of such a random shutdown to a very low
                order of probability.</li>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>:&nbsp; Jordan
                has greatly improved the symbolic debugging, with the
                greatest improvement being that (where possible) the
                actual source code is displayed rather than disassembled
                source code.&nbsp; This lets you see not only program
                labels and variable names, but even program
                comments.&nbsp; Several versions of <a
                  href="yaAGC.html#LIST">the LIST command</a> have been
                implemented in the debugger, so that you can get various
                types of disassemblies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it's all
                related to the source files by filename and line number,
                so it's cross-referenced much more nicely.&nbsp; I'd say
                this feature is now at a completely satisfying stage,
                from a user's point of view.&nbsp; <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; The
                symbol tables created for this functionality are now <span
                  style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">quite
                  large</span>.&nbsp; (About 11 megabytes each for <span

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus249</span>.)&nbsp;
                Therefore, you'll now find that Virtual AGC is chewing a
                lot more disk space than before.<br>

                Slott (thanks, Jordan!) has sent in a very cool mod that
                integrates symbol tables produced by <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> into the
                "--debug" mode of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp;
The





















                upshot of this is that in some cases you can use
                symbolic names when debugging, rather than being forced
                to use absolute numeric addresses all the time.&nbsp;
                It's still not fully implemented, but it's pretty
                valuable nonetheless.&nbsp; Refer to the <a
                  href="yaAGC.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                  page</a> to see how to use it.&nbsp; Symbolic
                debugging was on my wish list, but I was too lazy to do
                anything about it.&nbsp; Besides, it was very brave of
                Jordan to poke around in my source code.&nbsp;
                (Hopefully there won't be too much emotional
                scarring.)&nbsp; This builds and works on both Linux and
                Win32, but I haven't had a chance to try it in MacOS X.<br>

                (One octal word in Colossus249 was being assembled
                incorrectly in Win32; the incorrect octal word was being
                repaired by a workaround in the makefile, but would
                actually have executed properly even if it hadn't been
                repaired.&nbsp; Now that <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaYUL</span> is fixed, the workaround in the
                Makefile has been removed.)&nbsp; Also, some variable
                initializers which did not work properly Linux for
                PowerPC has been fixed; this error manifested itself in
                assembly-time error messages, but presumably could have
                caused incorrect octals as well.</li>

                ever been built before on Mac OS X), and partakes of the
                automatic shutdowns recently put into the Win32 and
                Linux versions, and is so much more convenient to shut
                down.&nbsp; Furthermore, the installation/build
                instructions have been completely revamped, so the
                simulation is much more convenient to run, and a little
                more convenient to build.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>:&nbsp;
                There had been a bug in which the raw joystick values as
                received from the driver were being used for <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, without
                applying <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>'s
--yaw,





















                --pitch, and --roll adjustments, or even their default
                values; for me, this only affected the Win32 platform
                (with the symptom being that in ATTITUDE HOLD, the
                thrusters were continually firing to increase yaw), but
                it has been fixed for all platforms.&nbsp; The program
                has been tweaked so that its timing is much more
                convenient in Mac OS X.&nbsp; Also, if it does not find
                a joystick on start-up, it keeps trying until it finds
                one, so you can plug in the joystick after startup
                without having to restart the simulation.<br>

              <li>MS Windows:&nbsp; A few days ago I was able to modify
                the startup scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>,
                etc.) in Linux so that:&nbsp; a) they don't open so many
                useless windows; and b) they shutdown all of the Virtual
                AGC apps and windows when you choose to exit from any
                one of them.&nbsp; This is tremendously convenient, and
                is theoretically possible in Windows XP Pro, but not
                (apparently) in Windows XP Home, or any other version of
                Windows.&nbsp; The facilities for doing process
                management simply aren't provided in Windows in a form
                usable by batch files.&nbsp; So instead, I've written a
                program (WinAGC.exe) that accomplishes the same
                thing.&nbsp; It's a program that simply runs groups of
                programs, and then shuts down all of those programs when
                any one of them shuts down.&nbsp; I've revamped all of
                the Windows batch files (SimLuminary131.bat, etc.) so
                that they take advantage of WinAGC.exe.&nbsp; This
                should work in any version of Windows, but I've only
                tried it in Windows 98 (first edition), Windows XP Home,
                and Windows XP Pro.&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The downside is that you
              can no longer use any command-line parameters with the
              batch files.&nbsp; I've tried to make intelligent choices
              as to which command-line switches you might want, but if
              I'm wrong you need to edit one or another of the files
              SimLuminary131.xeq, SimLuminary131_lite.xeq,
              SimColossus249.xeq, or SimColossus249_lite.xeq.&nbsp;
              (These ".xeq" files contain the lists of files, along with
              their command-line parameters, that are run by
              WinAGC.exe.)&nbsp; Even then, there are some things you
              can't accomplish, such as running <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> in --debug
              mode.&nbsp; If you want to do that, I'd suggest setting
              the environment variable NOWINAGC=yes before running the
              startup scripts, as this will restore the batch files to
              their pre-WinAGC glory.<br>
              <br>
              Another downside is that that <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Allegro</span> and <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> are now really requirements rather
              than options, although I've not had a chance to update the
              instructions yet.&nbsp; The reason is that the startup
              scripts will abort if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
              and <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
              cannot be run, rather than ignoring it.&nbsp; (I must say,
              though, that you really want to run both of these things,
              although admittedly <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
              isn't of much use without a "3D game controller" --- i.e.,
              a joystick.&nbsp; Therefore, buy a joystick.)&nbsp; If you
              absolutely don't want to run these programs, or cannot for
              some reason, edit the appropriate ".xeq" file and prefix
              the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> and/or
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> lines

                allow automatic shutdown of the simulation when any of

                versions of Windows.&nbsp; To activate the new script
                feature, you need to set the environment variable XPPRO
                to anything non-blank.&nbsp; Since I don't have a

              <ul>
                <li>Fixes a critical bug within DSKY Lite which causes a
                  serious memory problem and therefore the slows down
                  handling the socket data when "Attitude Hold" was
                  activitated. Now <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                  does not fall behind in reading socket data anymore.</li>
                <li>The simulation of the joystick is very limited jet
                  and just in an experimental status. The steering
                  commands are only recognized when they are along the
                  three axis (Roll, Pitch and Yaw). A combined steering
                  command (e.g. u or v axis) is not yet
                  implemented.&nbsp; Also, the calculation of the RCS
                  fire time is based on the setting within the "Attitude
                  &amp; Speed Control" window.&nbsp; The simulation just
                  takes the RCS thruster time and multiplies that time
                  with the joystick amplitude divided by 57.&nbsp; That
                  means that a full stick deflection takes the selected
                  time as RCS fire time.</li>

                  Source: CSM/LM Spacecraft Operational Data Book Volume
                  III Mass Properties.)&nbsp; Assumptions made:&nbsp;
                  Moment of Inertia along all three axes is identical
                  (which is obviously not completely true for the real
                  world).&nbsp; MOI change is stable over the whole LM
                  weight range (which is comparable with real world
                  behavior).</li>
                <li>It now interoperates with <span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">yaACA</span>, so that when you turn on
                  attitude-hold, you can see the digital auto-pilot
                  (DAP) firing thrusters in response to displacement of
                  the rotational hand-controller (RHS).&nbsp; Of course,
                  if you don't have a 3D joystick, this will be of
                  little value to you.&nbsp; Also, the connection has
                  not yet been made between the thrust outputs of the
                  CPU and the thrust inputs of the IMU.&nbsp; In other
                  words, while the IMU can respond to thrust inputs
                  entered into it manually, it will not yet respond to
                  the thrust commands generated by the CPU.&nbsp; (By
                  the way, turning on ATTITUDE HOLD causes a program
                  alarm 32000---which is a CPU overload---but this is
                  not <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>'s
fault.&nbsp;

                Was incorrectly saving the contents of CM erasables in

                would always start up using the <span

              <li>In general:&nbsp; Virtual AGC has been opening so many
                windows on your screen, that it's very difficult not
                only to manage them, but also to make sure you get all
                of the individual programs closed when you want to exit
                the simulation.&nbsp; The startup scripts have now been
                modified to that in Linux, so that not only are less
                xterms open, but also closing any one of the
                applications (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>)
                will also close all of the other applications and
                windows as well.&nbsp; I only found out how to do this
                by accident, and it's awfully convenient!&nbsp; I don't
                know how to do this in Windows, but I'm sure I'll figure
                it out one of these days.&nbsp; (Of course, if anybody

                which uses 445N for each thruster and a specific impulse

                My changes yesterday to fix fine-alignment had the
                side-effect of causing the alignment changes to look
                very jumpy on the FDAI ball.&nbsp; The (relative)

                coarse-alignment is much more smooth-looking than it had
                been previously.&nbsp; More importantly, the optics
                trunnion &amp; shaft drive is now supported, by means of
                new <a href="developer.html#Fictitious_IO_Channels">fictitious

              <li>Stephan has sent a new version of <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>.&nbsp;
                Here are the changes:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Workarounds added when we believed the
                  fine-alignment problems were on the <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> side
                  rather than the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                  side have been removed.&nbsp; (Specifically, the
                  angle-increment value is corrected, and the coordinate
                  transformation has been deactivated.)</li>
                <li>Drives the IMU to Zero when the "Zero IMU CDU"
                  signal is activated. Now the IMU zeros after V36E (AGC
                  reset) but there are cases where the AGC lefts the
                  signal active. After using the crew button "Zero
                  IMU..." the signal goes back to zero.</li>
                <li>Drive the IMU only when "Coarse Align Enable of IMU"
                  is activated. This is really an important change,
                  because in the "Attitude Hold Mode" the AGC uses the
                  counters to drive the error needles and the autopilot
                  misalignment. If the IMU was driven in such cases,
                  then the FDAI would jump uncontrollably over a small
                  angle area.</li>
                <li>Socket Timeout added. If there is a period longer
                  than 2 seconds when no data appears on the socket,
                  then the LM Simulator assumes that the AGC has been
                  terminated. After showing an error message: "Lost
                  connection to yaAGC" the program terminates
                  itself.&nbsp; (This is a slight problem when yaAGC is
                  run in --debug mode.&nbsp; We are looking at fixes for
                  that case now.)</li>
                <li>Attitude &amp; Speed Control has been changed.&nbsp;
                  (You don't have the same precise level of control over
                  roll, pitch, and yaw as before, but it's much easier
                  to use.)<br>

                  in high resolution and a counter which counts in angle
                  increments of (0.01Deg).&nbsp; Previously, only the
                  latter was used, leading to large angle misalignments

                Previously, there was no use made of the GYROCMD counter
                register in gyro torquing during fine-alignment.&nbsp;
                Since the GYROCMD register is the central entity in this
                operation, that pretty much ruined it.&nbsp; The upshot
                of this fix is that IMU fine-alignment should now work
                properly.<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">Well, I now like <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s ability to
            display downlink lists so much that I've split off that
            ability from the "--test-uplink" command-line switch, and
            added it to a new "--test-downlink" command-line
            switch.&nbsp; In fact, "--test-downlink" is used by default
            in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>
            and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span>
            startup scripts.&nbsp; Of course, the ability to completely
            display all downlink lists isn't quite available.&nbsp;
            However, the erasable dump downlist is still available, and
            the AGS initialization/update downlist is complete.<br>

              <li>Rewrote a lot of the telemetry-downlink formatting
                code I added yesterday.&nbsp; I realized that I could
                write it in a way that was much more flexible so that
                even though it is used in <span style="font-weight:

                also be used without change in <span

                apps, with mere replacement of a pointer to the function
                that does the actual output.&nbsp; In other words, the
                code is now completely reusable, and independent of the
                output device.&nbsp; Consequently, I feel much more
                enthusiastic about going ahead to do more work on it.</li>
              <li>Stephan has sent over a new version of <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>.&nbsp;
                Here's a summary of the changes, as I understand them:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>There are now Roll, Pitch and Yaw commands in the
                  attitude window, which translate into the associated
                  IMU gimbal angle changes.&nbsp; (Previously, there
                  were X, Y, Z gimbal-angle commands that simply drove
                  the gimbal angles without translation.)</li>
                <li>There is a kind FDAI ball in the IMU window now,
                  though Stephan points out that "with TCL/TK there is
                  no chance to create a <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">real</span> FDAI ball." (Even so, in my
                  humble opinion, it seems darned good.)</li>

            <ul>
              <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s
                "--test-uplink" mode, I now print out a little of the
                downlink lists in more human-friendly form, but there's
                just <span style="font-style: italic;">so much</span>
                data that the effort of making it human-friendly---i.e.,
                printing it with descriptive headings and units, and
                scaled properly---is enormous.&nbsp; There are a couple
                of thousand data values in the complete collection of
                downlink lists (though, admittedly, with some overlap
                among the lists).&nbsp; I don't think I'll do much more
                of it right now.&nbsp; I have, however, organized the
                hooks for doing it into libyaAGC, so the effort isn't
                entirely wasted, and is potentially reusable by anyone
                who wants to complete the work.&nbsp; I'd be more
                excited about doing it myself, if I knew what the
                displays on the downlink-telemetry consoles in
                mission-control were supposed to look like.<br>
              </li>
              <li>I have added a couple of new commands (LMSIM and
                CMSIM) to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>/<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> INI
                files.&nbsp; These commands tell the simulation whether
                it is supposed to be for an LM or a CM.&nbsp; (Odd that
                this hasn't been needed until now, isn't it?)&nbsp; The
                downlink lists for the LM and CM aren't distinguishable
                in some cases without this additional info.&nbsp; (They
                would have been distinguishable in real life, because
                the telemetry downlink hardware external to the CPU
                would have added this identfying info, I think.)<br>

                The digital uplink has now been implemented.&nbsp; I had
                to modify the description of it that I added to the
                developer page a few days ago, but not by much.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>:&nbsp;
                I've added a new command-line switch,
                "--test-uplink".&nbsp; In this mode, <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> emits
                uplink-data when keys are pressed instead of emitting
                keycodes to its usual CPU input channel 015.&nbsp; This
                mode is very convenient for testing the digital uplink,
                since the uplink data consists of encoded DSKY keycodes
                anyhow.&nbsp; I've noticed that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> is very lazy
                in updating the DSKY display when receiving uplink data;
                indeed, it may or may not update the display.&nbsp;
                However, in the absence of other data, I assume this is
                a normal property of the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Luminary</span> and <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Colossus</span> flight software, rather than a
                bug in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp;
This





















                mode also prints messages when valid downlink data is
                detected, so I think it's fair to say that both the
                digital uplink and digital downlink are working properly
                now.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp;
If





















                you want to see something keen you can do with this,
                look at section 2.1.2 on p. 2-8 of the <a
                  href="NARA-SW/R-567-sec2-rev8.pdf"> LM GSOP</a>.&nbsp;
                Enter V71E on the DSKY (in --test-uplink mode), and
                proceed from there.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>:&nbsp; I
                now properly handle the DOWNRUPT interrupt
                request.&nbsp; The practical upshot of this is that the
                CPU is now emitting downlink telemetry and/or AEA
                initialization packets, whereas it was not doing so
                before.&nbsp; You can see the downlink in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>, but
                it's just raw data on i/o channels 034 and 035, and so
                isn't very informative as of yet.<br>
              </li>
              <li>I rationalized the startup scripts somewhat.&nbsp; In
                particular, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                script is created during installation, and the other
                scripts (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>)
                call that script.&nbsp; This shouldn't matter much to
                anybody but me, I guess, but it allows <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s --debug
                switch to be used again with the scripts.&nbsp; Scripts
                like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>
                can have up to three command-line arguments, the first
                of which is passed (in common) to <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, the second
                one of which is passed to <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span>, and the third one of which is
                passed to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp;
Scripts





















                like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131-lite</span>
                have a single optional command-line argument, which is
                passed directly to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The





















                table below is probably a complete list of the <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">useful</span> ways you can
                use the command-line options with the scripts.&nbsp;
                (Though not shown, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span>[<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">-lite</span>] scripts work
                the same way, but obviously without <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> and the
                DEDA.)&nbsp; If you want to do something trickier, you
                should probably run the various programs directly rather
                than relying on the startup scripts.<br>

            before, in that the DEDA will freeze up, or readouts will
            occur that I can't figure out any way to stop, but it
            doesn't seem to have anything particularly to do with the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">DVP</span>
            instruction.&nbsp; Typically, this will be readout of
            address 555, which begins spontaneously, and which I can't
            turn off.<br>

                <li>To allow a free configuration (e.g. on/off) of
                  windows or different IP-Addresses to connect to yaAGC
                  an INI-File has been added (lm_system_simulator.ini)</li>
                <li>The window arrangement and content has been
                  optimized</li>
                <li>The IMU Coarse Align and IMU Fine Align is
                  implemented, although the last one does not work
                  correctly. (The counter is merely for very small
                  angles quite proportional to the given angle)</li>

            associated drive-enable bits in output channel 14) needed
            for continuing development of the IMU --- in this case, of
            IMU coarse alignment.&nbsp; Modified the description on the
            developer page of the description of channel 14 needed to
            use this feature, as well as the description of the CDUxCMD
            registers in the assembly-language manual page.&nbsp;

            the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DVP</span>
            instruction according to an algorithm sent to me by Julian
            Webb.&nbsp; (Thanks, Julian!)&nbsp; I'm bound to say that
            there are a number of things that don't make sense about it
            to me, but it does manage to pass the self-test (which no
            algorithm I invented was able to do).&nbsp; Anyone who feels
            competent to do so is invited to examine the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">DVP</span> instruction in
            the function <span style="font-family: monospace;">aea_engine</span>
            of the source file aea_engine.c, and give me your insights
            on the matter.&nbsp; Otherwise, though,&nbsp; <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now passes the
            built-in self-test (see, for example, p. 115 of Flight
            Program 8), and may therefore be cautiously considered as
            working.&nbsp; Probably there are plenty of problems with it
            that will surface slowly in the coming months.<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-style:

              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>Unknown unprogrammed sequences as output of the
                  AGC/AGS are now handled (hopefully ;-))</li>
                <li>Improvement of the DSKY Lite by using real 7-Segment
                  numbers</li>
                <li>Remove of a trace (inserted for development) of an
                  internal timer which would fill up the Log-Out-Window</li>
                <li>Crew Button handling (AOT, Descent) corrected</li>
                <li>DSKY PRO button is now working</li>
                <li>Time printouts removed</li>
                <li>DSKY Labeling and Number Size as well as separation
                  lines corrected and added.</li>
                <li>Most important, the program now merely recognizes
                  AGC data packages with the following signature: 00...
                  01... 10... 11... So, the AGS packets shouldn't have a
                  negative impact any longer.<br>

              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>AGC Output has been completely revised. Now I'm
                  using text labels which will show the different state
                  of the signals.</li>
                <li>LM System Signals and Crew Buttons corrected. I'm
                  still unsure in some cases.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-style: italic;">New Features:</span><br
                style="font-style: italic;">
              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>DSKY LITE is a very simple (awful graphics) but full
                  functioning DSKY. Due to your extensive description of
                  the interface it was quite simple to implement.</li>
                <li>IMU Simulation has been corrected and accelerated.
                  The angles are now running between 0\B0 and 360\B0 as
                  noted by the AGC.</li>
                <li>Simple RHC and THC as well as AOT buttons added</li>
                <li>Noun &amp; Verbs and first steps of the Tutorial
                  added.</li>
              </ul>
              The "DSKY LITE" is, I think, remarkably good, in spite of
              Stephan's badmouthing of the graphics.<br>

                Orbiter simulator.&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp; It's going great,
                and there is now a Sourceforge project for it, again
                thanks to Markus Joachim.)</li>
              <li>There's now a skeleton of a <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGS</span> program.&nbsp; It doesn't do much
                yet other than to allow <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaDEDA</span> to connect to it, load the
                selected flight program, and keep accurate time, and
                execute a few types of instructions.&nbsp; Lots of
                instructions are implemented, but they're all of a
                rather simple nature.&nbsp; (But who knows if they're
                implemented <span style="font-style: italic;">correctly</span>?&nbsp;
I





















                haven't quite figured out yet how I'll be testing these
                things.)</li>
              <li>Stephan Hotto's <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                program is now included in the installation when doing
                'make install' (i.e., building from source).&nbsp; The <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>
                script runs <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                in addition to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC/yaDSKY</span>.&nbsp;
You





















                need to have Tcl/Tk installed to take advantage of this,
                but if you don't nothing bad will happen.&nbsp;
                Incidentally, Stephan has given me a list of a few
                problems he's found so far.&nbsp; I won't bother to put
                these in the buglist quite yet; the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> program
                is so new that it's in rapid flux.&nbsp; After it has
                settled down some, then I'll start recording bugs for
                it.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; This big
            bunch of changes isn't without cost.&nbsp; This stuff likely
            won't build (or won't build completely) on Windows and Mac
            OS X.&nbsp; I'll fix this up soon, but probably not until
            I'm happy with <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp;
Therefore,





















            Windows and Mac OS X users will probably want to stick with
            the binary packages, use an earlier source package, or else
            just take your chances.<br>

                default timestep for the numerical integration (6 hours

                realistic ephemeris data with a 1-hour rather than a
                1-minute timestep, and can therefore tremendously reduce
                the ephemeris data in size.&nbsp; For testing purposes,
                the Apollo8-epoch ephemeris data is very complete
                (including the Earth, Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars,

                Mr. Paul Fjeld has informed me that the digits in the
                DSKY simulation haven't been quite right.&nbsp; (In his
                words:&nbsp; "The digits on the [real] DSKY were unique
                and very cool.")&nbsp; Since Mr. Fjeld is both an artist
                and the Spacecraft Manager for LM-13 at the <a
                  href="http://www.cradleofaviation.org/exhibits/restorations/lem.html">
                  Cradle of Aviation Museum</a>, I'm inclined to believe
                him.&nbsp; Besides, he prepared an all-new set of images
                of the digits and sent them to me, thus saving me most
                of the work in changing them.&nbsp; So obviously, the
                appearances of the decimal digits have now changed in
                the software, and indeed, have changed pretty

              <li>Developer changes (normal functionality not
                affected):&nbsp; My original intention was that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> would be
                developed in a way that was very independent of the
                peripheral devices (like the IMU and DSKY), and somewhat
                independent as well from the means of interfacing to the
                peripherals.&nbsp; Unfortunately, over time this idea
                became corrupted to the point that it really became
                impossible for developers to use anything other than the
                default socket-based interface (which I still
                recommend!), unless the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span> source code itself was hacked
                quite a lot.&nbsp; This has become unacceptable, since
                there are a number of groups adapting <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> to existing
                flight simulators, or other purposes, and all of this
                independent hacking will make it time-consuming to port
                improvements to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                into all of these efforts.&nbsp; Therefore:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>I have&nbsp; separated all socket-based code from
                  the offending source-code file (agc_engine.c), and
                  replaced it instead by a simple 3-function API that
                  should be usable for developing memory-mapped i/o
                  models, embedded AGC's, or other purposes, <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">without further
                    modification to agc_engine.c</span>.&nbsp;<br>
                </li>
                <li>I have created an embedded demonstration (i.e., of
                  an AGC as embedded firmware) based on a Motorola
                  Coldfire microcontroller, using an unmodified
                  agc_engine.c.<br>
                </li>
                <li>These concepts will be explained in detail on the <a

                  next week or so, though no details are available there

                (And speaking of improvements that need to be
                back-ported ...)&nbsp; I have noticed that although I
                provided all of the hooks for processing external
                triggers for counters (such as gimbal CDU counters), I
                did not actually implement them.&nbsp; In other words,
                if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                received a signal to increment a counter register, it
                would not actually do so.&nbsp; Hopefully this has been
                fixed.</li>

                Mr. Paul Fjeld has told me of the existence of 3
                additional AGC software versions, including (apparently)
                both the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>

                command-line switch to get the smaller interface.&nbsp;
                The smaller interface doesn't really look very good,
                because it is simply blindly scaled down from the larger
                interface, rather than being optimized, but at least
                it's usable at 800×600 and 640×480 resolutions.</li>

The





















                timing for polling has been changed, in order to reduce
                the PC's CPU utilization.&nbsp; Also, backtrace
                references (as originally intended) are no longer
                created when not in --debug mode.&nbsp; (In Linux on my
                2.8GHz P4, the net effect of these changes is to reduce
                the CPU utilization from 90-98% to an immeasurably small
                percentage whilst waiting for --debug mode keystrokes,
                and to 0-2% whilst running the simulator.&nbsp; In
                Windows XP, the CPU utilization is 0.)</li>

Assembly

            doesn't.&nbsp; The validation test does fail the D--LCHK

            erasable memory) will have to be made 16-bits.&nbsp; This

                The <span style="font-family: monospace;">MSU</span>
                instruction has been "fixed"; this fix is dubious since
                it is "to the test" rather than from the functional
                description.&nbsp; The cases of "<span

                  style="font-family: monospace;">DCS L</span>" have
                been added.&nbsp; And --- yikes! --- fixed a major
                problem, in that I forgot to inhibit interrupts while
                overflow is present; the result was intermittent loss of
                overflow/underflow.&nbsp; By analogy with <span

              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s handling of i/o
            channels was incorrect, in that it internally used the wrong
            numeric format for them, so none of them worked properly;
            moreover, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            read the virtual input port, it never actually wrote to the
            virtual output port (except in --debug-dsky mode).&nbsp; As
            a separate issue, both <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s
and





















            <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s handling of
            the PRO key was wrong, in that the wrong bitflag was used

            correctly, not only in normal mode, but in --debug mode and
            in --debug-dsky mode.&nbsp; In experimenting with this, I
            noticed that it is impossible in --debug mode to ever find
            the PRO key pressed by checking "edit c32", because the PRO
            key sets this bit when the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
            key is pressed, and then clears the bit when released.&nbsp;
            Therefore, using "edit c32" will always find the bitflag
            associated with PRO cleared.&nbsp; But you can see that it
            works if you debug <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>

                instead of "<span style="font-family: monospace;">TC Q</span>".</li>
              <li>When <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
                is used with an instruction, the disassembler decodes
                and shows the instruction with the index added (along
                with a notation "w/i"), instead of leaving the user to
                deduce it.</li>
              <li>The timing used (i.e., the number of machine cycles in
                a given period of real-time) was messed up when --debug
                mode was used, since the time spent waiting at the
                debugger prompt was not accounted for.</li>
              <li>The timing also was not previously right with the
