              <li>It turns out that in all of the drawings so-far
                converted from the AGC Handbook to CAD (namely, drawings
                2005902B, 2005903A, 2005952-, and 2005973r), I had
                misinterpreted what were supposed to be connector pins
                as global nets.&nbsp; Those have all now been
                fixed.&nbsp; These schematics now all pass KiCad's ERC
                (Electrical Rule Checker), with the happy side effect
                that a few connections which didn't quite "connect"
                before, due to wire endpoints being physically very
                close visually but not actually touching, have been
                fixed as well.&nbsp; None of this makes a significant <i>visual</i>
                difference in the images created from the CAD files —
                mainly, little rectangular boxes with numbers in them
                have been replaced by little ovals with the same numbers
                in them — but it's a world of difference electrically
                and in terms of confidence in the transcription.</li>
              <li> All of the available drawings from the AGC Handbook
                for the DSKY module D7 power-supply circuit have also
                now been transcribed to KiCad, and thus have "pretty"
                drawings associated with them on the <a
                  href="ElectroMechanical.html">electro-mechanical page</a>.&nbsp;

                They actually turn out to all be identical, except that
                they have different choices of some resistor and
                capacitor values.</li>

                  2005921- and the circuitry found in AC Electronics
                  document ND-1021042 as a guide.&nbsp; The need for a
                  reconstruction is, of course, that we don't have an
                  actual copy of drawing 2005937 in either the AGC
                  Handbook or elsewhere. <br>

                But there were pretty important changes to the <i>reconstructed</i>
                schematic 2005973, since Mike Stewart pointed out that
                circuit simulations proved that document ND-1021042 was
                wrong and drawing 2005952 was correct with respect to

                AGC Handbook, plus 1 "reconstructed" but

                Electronics document ND-1021042.&nbsp; The transcribed
                drawings are obviously a lot nicer than the 50-year-old
                xeroxes of the originals, but also potentially contain
                so-far undetected errors not present in the

          <td valign="top">The basis for our new <a
              href="ElectroMechanical.html">electro-mechanical page</a>,
            first mentioned a couple of days back, is a notebook called
            the AGC Handbook, given to us by Don Eyles.&nbsp; This is
            not so much a "document" as it is (or <i>was</i>) an
            evolving collection of electrical and mechanical drawings
            for the Block II AGC and DSKY.&nbsp; I'm not sure just how
            many drawings are in the book, but it has around 550 pages,
            and the drawings average around two pages each.&nbsp; So ...
            a <i>lot</i> of drawings.&nbsp; At any rate, Mike Stewart
            has finished scanning it, and we now have the complete thing
            online.&nbsp; In a slight variation from our usual practice,
            the document-library page of the website has been bypassed,
            so <a href="Documents/agc_handbook_jp2.pdf">a reduced-size
              (170MB) PDF appears on the electro-mechanical page</a>

              full-quality scans do appear on our Internet Archive page</a>.<br>
            <br>
            It is known that there was a Block I AGC Handbook as well,
            and presumably later versions of the Block II AGC Handbook
            covering later versions of the AGC/DSKY, but we don't have
            any such handbooks.&nbsp; We never heard of them before Don
            Eyles broached the subject a couple of weeks ago, and so
            never even knew to look for them.&nbsp; If you know of any
            AGC Handbooks anywhere, please let us know, so that we can
            try to fill in the remaining gaps in our collection of
            electrical schematics!<br>

              <li>As students of AGC assembly language know, the AGC
                language is actually an intermixture of pure machine
                code (called "basic" instructions) and higher-level
                instructions ("interpretive" instructions) that are
                executed on a built-in interpreter which is itself is
                written in basic instructions.&nbsp; In an AGC program
                such as LUMINARY or COLOSSUS, a sequence of interpretive
                instructions is marked by the fact that it begins with
                the basic instruction <tt>TC INTPRET</tt> (to <i>start</i>
                a block of interpretive code) or <tt>TC DANZIG</tt> (to
                return to interpretive code from a basic-instruction
                subroutine called by interpretive code);&nbsp; other
                basic instructions precede the <tt>TC INTPRET/DANZIG</tt>,
                while interpretive instructions follow it.&nbsp; All
                very well and good ... but while INTPRET is clear, why<i>
                  <u>DANZIG</u></i>?&nbsp; Danzig is obviously (or <i>was</i>
                obviously) the name of a city in Poland, but is that
                significant somehow?&nbsp; Since this is the kind of
                thing I worry about, I've wondered about it since the
                beginning of this project, about 15 years ago.&nbsp; But
                on that issue, today is the day to stop wondering! I now
                know why, and you can know why too, if you follow <a
                  href="assembly_language_manual.html#Danzig">this link

              <li>Enthusiasts may also recall that Hugh Blair-Smith has
                graced us with his preliminary notes on what an improved
                AGC architecture, which he terms "Block III", might look
                like.&nbsp; Well his thinking on the subject, upon which
                he has been working with Bruno Muller, have advanced a
                lot in the couple of years since we last heard anything

              <li>On the AGC assembly-language page of this site, my
                intention was always to create a comprehensive manual
                for AGC assembly language.&nbsp; While this was <i>somewhat</i>
                successful for the AGC's so-called "basic" instructions,
                it turned out to be sadly completely inadequate for the
                AGC interpreter language, whose descriptive section was
                basically a promisory note for future content that I

            Naturally, the content might have changed a little from 1966
            to 1972, but I don't think you're going to find a better
            discussion of the topic anywhere in our document library, or

            What's important is that these are basically "theory of

            that's just speculation at the moment, and so we may or may

                today seem like relatively small downloads then seemed
                like freakingly huge ones.&nbsp; Ah, 2003, will you ever
                come again?&nbsp; At any rate, so-called comedy aside,
                back then I tended to put a little note next to each of
                the hyperlinks to show how many megabytes were in each
                document file.&nbsp; Well, times have changed, at least
                as far as download sizes are concerned, and those
                quaint, old notes warning you about 4MB or 5MB downloads
                now just seem silly now that many of our downloads are
                hundreds of megabytes.&nbsp; Besides, 90% of the newer
                additions to the library no longer had notations like
                that anyway.&nbsp; So I've just bit the bullet and

          <td valign="top">I got a complaint that the VirtualAGC GUI
            program wouldn't fit on a 800×480 7" Raspberry Pi
            touchscreen.&nbsp; No kidding!&nbsp; Well, that's part of a
            larger problem with it, it appears, in that while the
            program was attempting to interrogate the screen size and to
            adjust it user-interface format appropriately, that feature
            doesn't seem to have been working.&nbsp; So I've addressed
            both of those problems in the latest source-code updates in
            the GitHub repository.&nbsp; Instead of trying to make
            adjustments according to the screen size, the VirtualAGC GUI
            program now depends on command-line options:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>--radio-buttons — For the largest display screens
                (with, say, 1024 pixel rows).&nbsp; Mission selection is
                the "traditional" way, via radio buttons in the user
                interface.</li>
              <li>--dropdown — (The default.)&nbsp; For smaller display
                screens (with, say, 720 pixel rows).&nbsp; Mission
                selection is in the newer way, via a drop-down list.</li>
              <li>--squish — For the smallest display screens (with,
                say, 480 pixel rows).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For use with --squish only, there's also a --maximize
              command-line option that maximizes the program at startup.<br>
            </p>
            <p>There are no installers for this new program version as
              of yet, but I'll get around to it sometime if I hear no
              complaints in the meantime.<br>

                notable addition to the collection, because we
                previously had no final version of the descent

                this document differ from those cobbled together from
                the closest alternatives (Apollo 12 procedures or
                preliminary Apollo 11 procedures).&nbsp; This
                information is necessary, for example, in making
                simulated Apollo 11 landings in NASSP that are faithful

                They're also significant in a different way, in that

            of the two is a study (in 3 volumes), the "Flight Program

            replacing the LVDC assembly-language version of the LVDC
            software with versions in 4 different programming
            languages.&nbsp; As a part of this effort, large chunks (but
            not 100%) of the pre-existing LVDC software were actually
            ported to those 4 alternate languages, as well as being
            flowcharted and described in detail.&nbsp; Thus, though this
            document does not provide any LVDC code at all, it
            nevertheless provides much more internal detail about the
            LVDC software, in almost-usable form, than any other
            documentation presently available.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it

            heck anyone would actually get a meaningful script to run on
            the thing, since what you'd really want is realistic data
            from an actual mission simulation, rather than something
            recorded while just playing around with yaAGC and a
            DSKY.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The answer to that, it seemed to me, was to see if NASSP
            could log data about AGC-to-DSKY output-channel transactions
            or if not, could someone add it for me?&nbsp; Well, Nik Beug
            was kind enough to not only pep up NASSP's logging
            capabilities to meet my needs, but also to send me the log
            for a sample mission segment, namely an Apollo 8
            launch.&nbsp; So with a slight amount of work throwing
            together a little <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/convertNasspLog.py">Python





































































              script for converting Nik's NASSP log format</a> to the
            format I needed, I now had the ability to "play back" an
            Apollo 8 launch on the 3D DSKY.&nbsp; Yay, and thanks
            Nik!&nbsp; Hopefully we'll have a lot more of these scripts
            in the future. <br>
            <br>
            Now, unfortunately, not everybody is going to be able to
            have one of the 3D-printed DSKYs, so my next thought was
            this:&nbsp; Why not modify yaDSKY2 so that it can play back
            these scripts?&nbsp; So ... now it can!&nbsp; The way it
            works is that if you click on yaDSKY2's PROG indicator lamp
            with a mouse, you get a file dialog that allows you to
            choose a canned script for playback.&nbsp; Naturally, I've
            added this to <a

              introductory list of various fun things you can do with a

            (for "do it yourself") has been added, intended to be a
            simple tutorial on writing and running your own custom AGC
            programs to do stuff the AGC was never intended to do.&nbsp;
            As if I could write anything "simple"!&nbsp; This is
            prompted by the introduction onto the market of functional
            3D-printed DSKY look-alikes with integrated Raspberry Pi
            computers running Virtual AGC.&nbsp; It should probably be
            called an <i>iDSKY</i>.&nbsp; With units such as that,
            there seems to be a lot more interest in having the DSKY do
            cute stuff that's not necessarily directly AGC related than
            there is in pepping up the pure software simulation.&nbsp;
            Probably because there's more of a motivation to get value
            for your dollar, since the physical devices are costly while
            the software simulation is entirely free.&nbsp; <i>My</i>
            take on that is that it's fine to subvert the normal
            functionality of the unit, but that it should be implemented
            by writing programs in AGC assembly language to do it!&nbsp;
            (Well, I have my ideas about it, and nobody is forced to
            agree with me.&nbsp; :-) )&nbsp; At any rate, this is my
            attempt to encourage that.&nbsp; The new page is nowhere
            close to being complete, but I think it has enough on it to
            be useful.<br>

              description to our developer page of a Python 3 program</a>
            which can be used as the basis for quickly creating a
            simple, low-performance simulated peripheral device for use
            with yaAGC.&nbsp; Basically, it handles the details of
            connecting the peripheral to yaAGC and of parsing the
            information passed between them, leaving the developer with
            the task of determining what's supposed to happen to data
            to/from the AGC's input/output channels.&nbsp; The basic
            motivation is that this might be a good way to throw
            together physical implementations of AGC peripherals,
            without having to concern oneself with C++ or cross-platform
            graphical toolkits or other complicating factors, by
            embedding a Raspberry Pi in them, and running a variation of
            this Python 3 script on the Pi.&nbsp; There's also a sample
            Python 3 script that illustrates how to use this technique
            to create a (<i>very</i>) simple DSKY. <br>

                It is interesting to <i>me</i> primarily because it
                provides a little info about the ASC-15, which is the
                digital computer that preceded the LVDC and was used on
                the Saturn I and Saturn IB launch vehicles that preceded
                the Saturn V.&nbsp; The ASC-15, like the LVDC, was
                developed by IBM Federal Systems Division in Owego NY,
                but unlike the LVDC was a drum-memory computer rather
                than a ferrite-core-memory computer.&nbsp; I have
                briefly mentioned the ASC-15 on our LVDC page
                previously, but only as a guidance computer for the
                Titan II, since I had been unaware it was used on some
                Apollo launch vehicles.&nbsp; Regardless, the
                information in the newly-added memorandum is still quite
                meager, and I've not yet altered my comments about the
                ASC-15 on the LVDC page.&nbsp; It would be cool to get

                instruction, and sent a lot of descriptive material and
                even code demonstrating/fixing the problem ... the <i>same</i>
                problems Mike Stewart had later with his Block II
                simulator, and was gracious enough to fix directly in
                yaAGC over the course of the last year.&nbsp; But Dave

          <td valign="top">The good NASSP folks have been making an
            effort lately to get our AGS (abort computer) simulation
            integrated into NASSP, and into checking it out, which is
            great!&nbsp; What Ryan Callaway in particular found was that
            while a lot of stuff worked, a lot of stuff didn't work
            either.&nbsp; Mike Stewart jumped right in and managed to
            find a bug I had made in the AGS simulator, yaAGS.&nbsp; So
            Ryan now reports that it "looks like all phases of
            rendezvous work as advertised in lunar orbit. I used AGS
            calculations for every part and ags controlled burns as well
            with RR and PGNS as backup/basis of comparison" and "the AGS
            aborts the LM beautifully in both DPS and APS aborts".&nbsp;
            Which is not to say that yaAGS necessarily is 100% perfect
            now, but this one fix has improved its behavior
            tremendously.&nbsp; For now, you have to build the software
            from source if you want this fix, and it hasn't migrated
            into the installer packages for VirtualAGC yet.&nbsp; Great
            work, guys!<br>

            who was doing a project that involved the binary patterns
            used to encode characters, specifically in the word

            of these characters, easily recognizable by a 1960's

            her to use EBCDIC encoding.&nbsp; Then, in a rare fit of

            well.&nbsp; Hugh also said that EBCDIC was the appropriate
            answer, but then speculated about a separate matter:&nbsp;
            Is it possible to actually display the word "APOLLO" (or
            more accurately, "APOLO") directly on the DSKY itself?&nbsp;
            As you may recall, the DSKY was used to display <i>only</i>
            numbers and blanks, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible
            for appropriate software to display other patterns as
            well.&nbsp; Alas! it turned out not to be possible; none of
            the characters A, P, or L can be displayed.&nbsp; In fact,
            we ended up tracing through the DSKY's electrical schematics

                development time-frames, number of changes in each of
                the flight versions of the code, etc.&nbsp; The
                "amazing" part is the description of the amount of
                AGC-software related material sent to the
                now-unfortunately acronymed ISIS over the years —
                magnetic tapes of software, 10,000+ records of

                has been a certain amount of speculation as to which
                version of LUMINARY 99 flew in Apollo 11 ... was it
                LUMINARY 99 Rev 1 as we've been claiming all these
                years, and as documentation suggests, or was it LUMINARY
                99 Rev 2 as Jim Kernan (the original "rope mother" for
                the Apollo 11 LM software) says?&nbsp; The hope was that
                AP11ROPE might help resolve this question, given that it
                was printed long after Apollo 11 (namely, in 1970) and
                purports to be the mission code.&nbsp; Thus if AP11ROPE
                were identical to <a

                  LUMINARY 99 Rev 1 code</a> it would support the notion
                that Rev 1 was the one that flew, whereas if it were
                identical to <a

                relevantly different from Rev 1) then it might support
                the notion that Rev 2 is the one that flew.&nbsp; Well,
                octal-for-octal, it turns out that AP11ROPE <i>is</i>
                identical to LUMINARY 99 Rev 1.&nbsp; But it is not
                source-code identical; it appears to have been branched
                from LUMINARY 99 Rev 0 (not Rev 1) and then modified to
                bring it up to date with Rev 1, but not with identical
                program comments.&nbsp; That being the case, it doesn't
                really imply much about whether Rev 1 or Rev 2 was used
                in the actual mission.&nbsp; But it did turn out to be a
                nice, clean, easy-to-OCR scan, that should be very easy
                to use to route out lingering program-comment errors in
                our transcriptions.</li>

                Thanks, guys!&nbsp; Recall that ZERLINA is an "offline
                development" program that had been maintained by Don
                Eyles for experimenting with different types of
                improvements or fixes to LM software, and that AP11ROPE
                is actually a different printed copy of (we believe) the
                Apollo 11 LUMINARY 99 program we've already had for the
                last 10 years.&nbsp; But we're not <i>quite</i> sure
                yet that AP11ROPE and LUMINARY 99 are exactly the
                same.&nbsp; So we're going to check that (of course!),
                as well as to use it to cross-check yet again the
                existing transcription of LUMINARY 99. But there's no
                need to do a full transcription of AP11ROPE, unless we
                find out it's actually different in some way.&nbsp; A
                transcription of the AP11ROPE octals will be done,
                though, as part of the cross-checking process.&nbsp;
                ZERLINA, of course, we <i>will</i> be fully
                transcribing to source code, as well as creating an
                executable binary of it for the AGC simulator, starting
                immediately!&nbsp; At any rate, as usual, the scans are
                available both in lower-resolution (smaller-size) JPG
                and in archival higher-resolution (larger size) JPEG

                June-or-later.</li>
              <li>A bug in the SUNBURST 37 octal listing (whose release
                was mentioned on 5-27, see below) has been fixed.&nbsp;
                This was a marvelous and instructive typo in that it was
                a <i>single-digit error</i> that nevertheless did <i>not</i>
                cause a checksum error at runtime.&nbsp; That's because
                of an ambiguity in the checksumming system built into
                the AGC code:&nbsp; the checksum of a memory bank must
                be equal to either the bank number or else the negative
                of the bank number.&nbsp; In this case, the error was in
                memory bank 1, and the single error (in which the octal
                was off by 2) flipped the bank checksum from +1 to
                -1.&nbsp; This is a very rare type of error, but it's
                unfortunate that the system had that ambiguity.</li>
              <li>And speaking of checksums, it turns out that over the
                course of time, the algorithm used by YUL to generate
                the memory-bank checksums changed slightly.&nbsp; Prior
                to SUNBURST 116, I'm told, only the positive memory-bank
                values were used, but after that it was not always
                possible to generate the positive memory-bank values,
                and thus checksums for negative memory-bank values were
                generated when required.&nbsp; yaYUL has thus been
                modified with an appropriate new command-line switch to
                enforce this difference, allowing the removal of an
                annoying workaround in AURORA 12.&nbsp; (The assembly of
                both AURORA 12 and SUNBURST 37 are affected by this; the
                older RETREAD 44 has no checksums anyway, and so is not
                affected.)</li>
              <li>And speaking of annoying workarounds, the annoying "<tt>SBANK=</tt>
                workaround" has finally been eliminated!&nbsp; One of my
                more-irritating failures in writing the yaYUL assembler
                originally is that I was unable to figure out the scheme
                used by YUL/GAP to generate the so-called "superbank"
                bits in various address-generating pseudo-ops; in cases
                where the values of the superbits were actually
                important to the execution of the program, the bits
                generated by yaYUL were fine, but where they did not
                affect the execution, they were often wrong, and thus
                the code generated by yaYUL did not match the octals
                generated by YUL or GAP in those cases unless a handful
                of extra <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops that weren't
                originally present in the assembly language code were
                inserted into our source code.&nbsp; Personally, I
                simply threw up my hands in disgust with it, deciding to
                live with these extra <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops, but
                over the years several people have worked on incremental
                fixes and removal of <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops, never
                with full success.&nbsp; Certainly, getting the original
                source code for YUL helped out a lot.&nbsp; However,
                over the weekend, the problem seems to have been
                cracked, and the entire AGC code base, including all
                code versions that we have, now assembles to the proper
                octals, entirely without any extra <tt>SBANK=</tt>
                pseudo-ops at all.&nbsp; There seem to have been several
                insights that contributed to this breakthrough.&nbsp;
                Two stand out to my mind.&nbsp; One is that if you
                actually look at a page of an AGC program listing (say,
                <a href="ScansForConversion/Luminary210/0059.jpg">page
                  57 of LUMINARY 210</a>), you may notice (<i>I</i>
                never did!) that there's a mysterious notation like <tt>E<i>n</i>
                  S<i>m</i></tt>, under the page numbers in the upper
                right-hand corners of the pages.&nbsp; These turn out to
                be the memory-bank bits (including superbank
                assumptions) that YUL/GAP <i>thought</i> applied at
                that point; this observation gives a lot more visibility
                into what YUL is thinking at any given point.&nbsp; The
                other observation that stands out is that the
                assumptions made by YUL for these bank bits changed at
                some point (between SUNBURST 37 and 120), so that a
                slightly different rule (and a different yaYUL
                command-line switch) applies to earlier code versions
                than to later ones.&nbsp; Great work, guys!</li>
              <li>Not only that, but the transcription of SUNBURST 37
                source code is now complete, though I suppose I should
                admit that some of the comments in the code haven't been
                full proof-read for typos, so</li>

            As I mentioned in my note from a couple of days ago, instead
            of locally posting individual page images for SUNBURST 37 in
            reduced-quality JPG form, which is my normal practice for
            all other AGC versions, I had instead simply locally
            reposted the PDF from our Internet Archive collection,
            thinking that it was "good enough".&nbsp; In other word if
            you followed the links on <a
              href="Luminary.html#Sunburst37">our Luminary page</a>,
            you'd probably end up downloading this supposedly-fine PDF.
            Well it <i>wasn't</i> good enough, so ... my
            apologies!&nbsp; The PDF has weird artifacts in which some
            characters were frequently replaced by other characters,
            such as 'D' in place of 'O'.&nbsp; Whatever the reason for
            this weird effect, it's obviously intolerable, so if you
            follow through the links to our locally-posted
            reduced-quality images <i>now</i>, you'll now find
            individual JPG pages.&nbsp; The <i>high-quality</i> images
            in our Internet Archive collection don't have this strange
            problem, and so can be used without fear, but I definitely

            that a foolish consistency may <i>not</i> be the hobgoblin
            of little minds, if the effect of that consistency is to
            enforce a tried-and-true method rather than succumbing to

            As you may recall, SUNBURST 37 (also known as SHEPATIN 0) is
            an early version of the SUNBURST program, never used for any
            mission, though SUNBURST 120 was used later in the LM's AGC
            in the Apollo 5 unmanned mission.&nbsp; Like RETREAD and
            AURORA, SHEPATIN is another "missing link" in the AGC
            software's evolutionary development.<br>
            <br>
            As usual, we'll be producing an octal file for this (so that
            SHEPATIN can be run in the AGC simulator) as well as
            source-code files (so that we can do nice searching on it,
            have syntax-highlighted listings, and so on), but that will
            be a process that takes a bit of time.&nbsp; Right now, all

            source code and various other purposes, has been exhibiting
            some anomalous behavior that I hadn't noticed before.&nbsp;
            I think this may stem from the fact that in the VM releases
            I've made so far, a fairly old version of Midori is being
            used.&nbsp; While I'll obviously fix this in the <i>next</i>

            the simulation was for investigating certain proposed
            changes to the landing code, and the fact that it used

                I'll write it up and generate Windows and Raspberry Pi
                installers after I'm more comfortable with the changes.
                The main change relates to the fact that we've now got
                so many different AGC versions available that the app's
                main window had become too big to display screens
                smaller than about 1280×1024. For screens smaller than
                that, the app will now automatically change the format
                so as to make its main window a lot smaller.&nbsp; This
                works well for displays down to around 800×720 (if there
                is such a thing), but for anything smaller than that
                you'll still be out of luck.&nbsp; You do lose the
                capability of running your own "custom" AGC software
                from the smaller-screen version of the GUI.&nbsp; The
                changes are just to the VirtualAGC GUI, and not to any
                of the simulations, so there's still no guarantee that
                you can fit an entire simulation onto a smaller screen.<br>

            Apollo-Soyuz, though we really don't know).&nbsp; Since we
            don't actually have any source code for Skylark so far, and
            since the "Programmed Guidance Equations" are a kind of
            pseudo-code description of the source code, I guess this is
            the next-best thing to having the Skylark program
            itself.&nbsp; At any rate, here's a direct link:<br>

            <ul>
              <li>AGC CPU-simulation features:&nbsp; As you may know,
                the AGC had the ability of being able to execute a
                different instruction (stored in the B/BRUPT registers)
                upon return from an interrupt-service routine (ISR) than
                was stored at the actual address at which execution
                resumed afterward.&nbsp; In other words an ISR could
                load the binary value of the instruction it wanted
                executed upon return into the BRUPT register, and even
                though the RESUME instruction would cause the program
                counter to be loaded correctly, the binary instruction
                in BRUPT would be executed, irrespective of the value
                stored at the RESUME'd program-counter address.&nbsp;
                This was originally not a "feature", but was simply a
                consequence of the fact that the next instruction to be
                executed is always decoded by the AGC during the
                execution of the <i>preceding</i> instruction, and thus
                the decoded next instruction needed to be stored
                somewhere during an ISR, and subsequently restored after
                the ISR had been completed.&nbsp; Considered as a
                "feature", this is rather useless for ISRs, since all it
                can really do is crash the program or do something else
                that's unpleasant, but <i>could</i> be useful for
                something like a software-controlled interrupt, such as
                the EDRUPT instruction.&nbsp; The EDRUPT instruction,
                seemingly created for Ed Smalley's AGC self-test code,
                though possibly never used by him at all, was not
                something that was really needed for anything, but was
                instead created (as Hugh Blair-Smith has said) "because
                he could".&nbsp; At any rate, while I originally
                intended to implement this same behavior in the AGC CPU
                simulator, it caused difficulties for me ... and since
                it didn't seem to be used anywhere in the Luminary 131
                AGC code I originally worked with, I simply disabled the
                feature entirely rather than try to figure out how it
                was misbehaving.&nbsp; In other words, for all these
                years, yaAGC has simply been ignoring whatever is in the
                B/BRUPT registers.&nbsp; At any rate, Mike Stewart, in
                his unswerving quest to make yaAGC work <i>correctly</i>
                as opposed to well-enough, and to agree in its behavior
                with the Block II hardware simulation, has now debugged
                this behavior and fully restored B/BRUPT/EDRUPT.&nbsp;
                All known self-test software related to this behavior
                works correctly, yaAGC does agree with the hardware
                simulation, and the restored code has been tested
                multiple times in the NASSP Command Module and Lunar
                Module simulations.&nbsp; In short, B/BRUPT and EDRUPT
                are back, baby!&nbsp; Many thanks to Mike Stewart and
                the NASSP gang.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Updated the VirtualAGC installer (again!), not only
                  for Ubuntu (for the VirtualAGC VM), but also for
                  Raspberry Pi.</li>
                <li>We once again have an installer for Windows as
                  well.&nbsp; I discontinued this some time ago because
                  it was such a hassle for me to maintain, but it's back
                  ... at least for now.&nbsp; As far as the Mac is
                  concerned, well that's still too, too much for me to
                  keep up with, so the installer for that is still
                  discontinued, and not likely to be reinstated.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Updated the VirtualAGC VM, which is really what I'd
                  prefer the casual user to use.&nbsp; While for the
                  most part the old VM could simply be updated with the
                  Ubuntu VirtualAGC installer mentioned above, there are
                  a number of other niceties I've changed, and not
                  handled by the installer, such as:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added Code::Blocks visual-debugging links to the
                    desktop for many more AGC versions.</li>
                  <li>Eliminated the password entry associated with the
                    screen-saver, which I hadn't realized was enabled.</li>
                  <li>Replaced of the Firefox web-browser by the Midori
                    web-browser.&nbsp; While I don't expect anybody to
                    really be web-browsing from the VirtualAGC VM, the
                    web-browser is used by VirtualAGC for presenting the
                    AGC source code, and Midori is insanely faster than
                    Firefox at doing this, as well as being less
                    memory-hungry and disk-space hungry.&nbsp; So using
                    Midori is a win-win-win.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>It is perhaps notable that the use of installer
                  programs as such for the VirtualAGC package has now
                  been discontinued, and what I'm calling "installers"
                  are really just compressed archives of type "tar.xz",
                  which the user must manually uncompress.&nbsp; There
                  is some slight loss of ease for the user, in that
                  desktop icons and start-menu entries are no longer
                  created automatically.&nbsp; But there are compelling
                  reasons behind this move.&nbsp; The principal
                  motivation is that a tar.xy archive tends to be about
                  half the size of one of the old installer programs
                  (currently 20MB vs 40MB), <i>and</i> it's much easier
                  from a system-maintenance standpoint as well.&nbsp;
                  Thus, updating the "installers" more often becomes a
                  more-attractive proposition.<br>

                Most of these are more from a desire to avoid the

              <li>I've noticed for some time that there's a problem when
                I add lots of documents to the document library, because
                there's really no way to tell at a glance what has been
                added recently, and what has been there for a long
                time.&nbsp; I'm trying out adding an icon <img
                  src="new.png"> next to recent additions to the
                document library, with a notation at the top of the
                document library page telling what time-frame the icon
                is associated with.&nbsp; Right now, for example,
                everything added in March of this month (or presumably
                later if there is a later) is marked.&nbsp; We'll see
                how well it works.&nbsp; I've seen all too many sites
                where once something gets marked as "new", it may
                continue to be marked as "new" for years and years ...
                and obviously, that's not very helpful.&nbsp; At any
                rate, this only applies to the document library page,
                and not to the website in general.<br>

                from (say) Luminary 99 to Luminary 116 to Luminary 131
                to whatever.&nbsp; Of course, the LUMINARY Memos aren't
                entirely complete, either in their coverage of events,
                nor in our collection of them.&nbsp; Well, the SCB Notes
                have a similar virtue, again if complete, in that they
                provide much the same information about software
                changes.&nbsp; Moreover, since in theory <i>every</i>
                software change had to be approved by the SCB, there
                shouldn't be as much of a completeness problem in the
                notes themselves, though obviously we have every bit as
                much of a problem in the completeness of our collection
                of them.&nbsp; In the case of SCB notes, though, they
                don't track changes like Luminary 99 → 100, but rather
                changes like Luminary 1B → 1C.&nbsp; This still ends up
                giving us the mission-to-mission changes, even if not
                the fine-grained revision-to-revision changes.<br>

              <li>It has been pointed out to me that the document
                library contained a few of the missions' technical crew
                debriefings, but that several more were missing though
                available elsewhere.&nbsp; So for the sake of
                consistency, the Apollo 12, 13, 14, and 16 technical
                crew debriefings have been copied from the <a

                D'oh!&nbsp; If only I had a dollar for every time I had
                had to fix that over the years.</li>
              <li>The recent Users' Guide documents from Don Eyles,
                mentioned over the last couple of updates, turn out to
                have a handful of foldout pages which were getting
                messed up in the conversion of the document to
                PDF.&nbsp; It has taken me several tries to get right
                (the problem being, apparently, that pages with aspect
                ratios more-extreme than 2:1 don't work right in the
                PDF), but I now have PDFs that I think are fully
                working.&nbsp; The fix to the PDFs has messed up those
                pages in the online viewer in our Internet Archive
                collection (sigh!), but the foldouts still legible
                there, and I'm willing to live with that.</li>
              <li>I've been chided for making it appear that the
                recently-added Programmed Guidance Equation documents
                from Don Eyles, for Luminary 1B and 1C, mentioned a few
                days ago, weren't very useful.&nbsp; That's a fair
                criticism, so I've modified my comments.&nbsp; While it
                is true that I think calling these documents the
                "Guidance Equations" is misleading, it would also be
                true that better titles for them would be "Pseudo-Code
                Descriptions of Luminary 1B" and "... 1C".&nbsp; And
                that, of course, can make them <i>very</i> valuable for
                someone trying to comprehend the Luminary 1B and 1C
                programs.&nbsp; As Don said when he gave them to me,
                "Now, you know, <i>we</i> [AGC developers] didn't ever
                use these documents; they were written afterward for <i>other</i>
                people" (or words to that effect, anyway).&nbsp; But <i>we</i>
                are the "other people" in this little scenario, so while
                these documents may not be so important for Don, they
                may indeed be very important for us.<br>

                  Number Strapdown Computations</a>".&nbsp; While I had
                scanned the darn thing at the time, and uploaded the
                archival-quality scans to our Internet Archive
                collection, I had failed to replace the old, bad version
                in our document library.&nbsp; D'oh!&nbsp; Well, I've
                done it now.&nbsp; It's an interesting concept that
                never made it into an actual spacecraft, but well-worth
                reading about.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Niklas Beug has made another video to supplement his
                previous Apollo 11 lunar landing simulation video (using
                Orbiter/NASSP/VirtualAGC/Luminary99), namely an Apollo
                15 simulated lunar landing (using
                Orbiter/NASSP/VirtualAGC/Luminary210), and I've linked
                it at a couple of a strategic locations.&nbsp; Here's <a
                  href="https://youtu.be/E301HplyA7A">a direct link to
                  YouTube</a>.&nbsp; For my taste, it's a lot more
                exciting than the Apollo 11 landing (minus the 1201/1202
                alarms and the boulder field at the very end of the
                Apollo 11 landing, of course), since you get to swoop in
                over the mountains; Nik indicates it's his favorite
                landing site as well.&nbsp; As far as it being a
                favorite landing site is concerned: I don't know if it
                depicts a real event or not, but the Apollo 15 episode
                of <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i> dramatizes Dave
                Scott as arguing for this Hadley-Apennine site (vs a
                "safer" landing site) in the decisive site-selection
                meeting, presenting the argument that it's worthwhile
                exploring beautiful places.</li>
              <li>I've done a lot of cross-version checking of our AGC
                source code (Luminary 69 vs Luminary 99 vs Luminary 116
                vs Luminary 131 vs Luminary 210; Colossus 237 vs
                Colossus 249 vs Comanche 55 vs Artemis 72; and Luminary
                99 vs Comanche 55), which has not only found various
                lingering errors (mostly look-alikes such as '0'⇆'O',
                '1'⇆'I', '.'⇆',', and so on), but more-importantly,
                insures consistency across AGC versions, hence reducing
                spurious "changes" for anybody who is interested in
                detailed tracking of changes from one AGC version to the
                next.&nbsp; Consequently, I've updated <a

                probably take the Internet Archive a week or so to

                that we'll have nice, compact PDFs with text-search,

                  I wouldn't really describe this as "guidance
                  equations".&nbsp; The document itself says it should
                  be used in conjunction with a listing of the AGC
                  software (in this case, Apollo 12 Lunar Module, and
                  specifically Luminary 116), and my characterization of
                  it is that it is a more-detailed, mostly-textual
                  description of the various objects (specifically
                  variables) appearing in the software than can be found
                  in the program comments themselves.&nbsp; In other
                  words, it doesn't superficially appear to have much to
                  do with "guidance equations", though admittedly it has
                  &gt;1000 pages, and I've not read it in detail as of
                  yet.</li>

                  This is basically the Apollo 13 equivalent of

          <td valign="top">Lately, there has been some confusion as to
            whether the Luminary 99 source code we have been providing
            is actually the code that flew in the Apollo 11 LM or not,
            due to AGC developer Jim Kernan's recollections that there
            are three different revisions of that particular code
            (Luminary 99, Luminary 99 Rev 1, and Luminary 99 Rev 2), and
            the only version we actually have is Luminary 99 Rev
            1.&nbsp; Well, on the balance of the surviving evidence,
            what we currently believe is that Luminary 99 Rev 1 did
            indeed fly in Apollo 11, but also that Jim's recollection is
            correct and that there's a Rev 2 that is "better" in a
            certain way, but which didn't fly.&nbsp; But we have no
            physical printout for Rev 2.<br>
            <br>
            The explanation is that the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris">ephemeris</a>
            data in Rev 1 is wrong, but not <i>very</i> wrong, and
            certainly good enough for a lunar landing.&nbsp;
            Nevertheless, we know what the correct ephemeris should be,
            because it's identical to Apollo 12 and 13, so to celebrate
            that fact, we've artificially <i>recreated</i> <a
              href="listings/LUM99R2/MAIN.agc.html">Luminary 99 Rev 2</a>
            for you, as a mashup of 99 Rev 1 and Luminary 116, and we
            provide <i>both</i> Rev 1 and Rev 2 for you.&nbsp; You can
            view the source code or simulate either one to your heart's
            content.&nbsp; You can take your pick.&nbsp; It's called
            "choice", friends!&nbsp; We've named Luminary 99 Rev 2 <a

              in the GitHub source tree</a>, because that's what Jim's
            story says he called it, way-back-when.<br>
            <br>
            We have also received new information about where a program
            listing for Comanche 44 exists.&nbsp; Comanche 44 did not
            fly on a mission, but Comanche 45 Rev. 2 (which is 2 months
            younger) flew in the Apollo 10 command module, so if we can
            get our hands on Comanche 44 some day, it may be the closest
            thing we'll ever have to Apollo 10 Command Module
            software.&nbsp; At any rate, the Colossus page has been
            updated with this info.<br>

                have an urge to double-check it.&nbsp; The comments in
                the source code undoubtedly still have quite a few
                errors, but after the transcription effort for Luminary
                116 has been completed, I intend to do a 3-way check of
                it vs Luminary 99 and 131, which should eliminate quite
                a few of the remaining errors.&nbsp; This actually means
                that all of the fully-transcribed AGC source-code
                versions have now been completely proofed in their
                comment text, albeit not all to the same standards, due

              <li>As usual, the proofing of Luminary 131's comments
                revealed various corresponding errors in the source code
                for other AGC versions, and those errors have been fixed
                as well.&nbsp; Consequently, there have been quite a few
                updates (not the least of which is Luminary 131 itself)
                in <a href="listings/">the colorized,

                added to the document library, although at this point it

                ... interesting if you are keen on that kind of thing,

                for implementing various areas of functionality over
                time, which had fairly-important design consequences, so
                they are certainly useful in that regard.</li>

                and demonstrates.&nbsp; The document in question, an

                time, this is naturally a huge help.</li>
              <li>There are a number of memos that give us more insight
                into what Zerlina is doing, and how.&nbsp; You may
                recall that Zerlina was an experimental program,
                branched from Luminary, and used to experiment with a
                number of new approaches.&nbsp; Furthermore, we will be
                obtaining Zerlina within the next few months, and going
                through our usual process of transcribing it into source
                code and running it in the AGC simulator.&nbsp; So it's
                nice to have some idea of what we can expect it to be
                doing.<br>

                and I've now uploaded all of the raw scan data to our
                Internet Archive collection.&nbsp; Now, I'll have to
                admit that, archival format or not, the visual quality
                is still rotten in comparison to the new scans, because
                I didn't understand things like white-balance settings
                when I took the pictures.&nbsp; Nevertheless, all of you
                (rather than I alone) now have access to the
                best-quality imagery available.&nbsp; Furthermore, in
                the future, I'll also be doing the same with any image
                files sent to me or that I personally scan.
                Incidentally, since AGC listings are <i>big</i>
                documents in comparison to what the Internet Archive
                normally handles, the initial processing on them may not
                yet be complete on all of these uploads if you rush over
                there right this instant to look at them; if the initial
                processing isn't complete, only the actually-uploaded
                data (gigantic PDFs 250MB-1.5GB in size) will be
                immediately accessible.&nbsp; After the processing is
                completed, you also have a convenient online flipbook
                viewing interface, a zipfile of JPEG2000 page images,
                and a more-compact PDF with searchable text.&nbsp;
                Solarium 55 is definitely ready for viewing at the
                moment I'm writing this, and the others should gradually
                become available over the next few days.&nbsp; Documents
                I end up scanning but which turn out not to be suitable
                for Virtual AGC proper, will simply remain in the
                Internet Archive collection; for example, you'll find <a
                  href="https://archive.org/details/MSC07857">a Shuttle
                  document</a> there that I happened to scan while
                scanning some AGC-related documents.</li>
              <li>I've also been busily correcting all of the metadata
                for the scans hosted in our Internet Archive collection,
                since we hadn't initially provided very good data at the
                time archive.org was making the scans.</li>
              <li>Three new documents pertaining to Apollo 4, 5, and 6
                have been contributed by AGC developer Jay
                Sampson.&nbsp; (Refer to the Sunburst 120 section of the
                Luminary page, and the Solarium 54 and 55 sections of
                the Colossus page.)</li>
              <li>Original AGC developer Jay Sampson has convinced us
                that the AGC versions used for these two missions
                (Solarium 54 and 55, respectively) are in fact <i>identical</i>
                though assigned different build numbers.&nbsp; In other
                words, we in fact have the AGC source code for Apollo 4,
                even though we didn't know we had it.&nbsp; I won't
                proclaim that discovery in a big box just yet,
                though!&nbsp; You can read the explanation in <a
                  href="Colossus.html#Solarium54">the Solarium 54 entry
                  on the Colossus page</a>.</li>
              <li>Original AGC developer Peter Volante has sent me a
                variety of organization charts for the Instrumentation
                Lab's Apollo development, which help to show how the
                organization evolved over time, and how the people
                within it moved around.&nbsp; I've added them as
                complementary to the list of developers gleaned from the
                AGC source code, in <a

              <li>I forgot to mention it, but proof-reading the program
                comments in Artemis 72 (Apollo 15-17 LM) has now been
                completed, and the improved source-code files have been
                available in our GitHub repo for a few days.&nbsp; The
                quality of the scan or the printout from which the scan
                was made was pretty poor, though, so there are likely to
                be more errors remaining than in many of the other AGC
                versions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there's a great
                improvement.</li>
              <li>We have had Luminary 131 (Apollo 13 LM software)
                scanned from a copy in Don Eyles's possession.&nbsp;
                Old-timers here may recall that the availability of a
                Luminary 131 scan was what enabled this entire Virtual
                AGC project in the first place, back in the day, and
                without it, none of this mighty empire of AGCosity would
                exist at all.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there's no getting
                around the fact that that original scan was miserable in
                quality, barely legible, and practically a study of how
                a scan of a color document shouldn't be.&nbsp; In fact,
                many of the errors in AGC program comments I mentioned
                above, and have been mentioning for the last several
                months, stemmed originally from that very unreadability,
                but the new scan will now be used to finally eliminate
                those errors from our Luminary 131 source-code
                files.&nbsp; So we're lucky that we now have a really
                great scan.&nbsp; Check it out in our <a

                    114 (Apollo 17), though the table of contents says

            the 1971 simulation of the Apollo 11 landing leaves somewhat
            to be desired in terms of the readability of the text ...
            it's just too light for comfortable reading, because the
            printout was too light.&nbsp; Thus, to compensate for that,
            I had provided a highly-processed B&amp;W PDF that is
            much-more readable.&nbsp; Well, I've now done some
            additional processing on the color images, to enhance the

                technical reports server, NTRS, which of course made it
                almost but not quite impossible to find.&nbsp; But
                better late than never!)&nbsp; We've dubbed this program
                "Super Job" because of the markings on it, though it's
                hard to believe that Raytheon actually called it

          <td valign="top">As you may have seen in the notes made here
            over the last few months, I have been in the process of
            proofing and correcting the comment text in the various
            source-code transcriptions we have made of the AGC program
            listings available to us.&nbsp; Hitherto, we had no
            efficient way to do this, but had developed a tool for doing
            so that worked quite well on most of the of program
            listings, with newer scans tending to work much better than
            older ones ... hence in doing this proofing, I found myself
            working backward in time, progressing from the latest AGC
            scans to the earliest, finally reaching the <i>original</i>
            scans with which the Virtual AGC project started, namely
            Colossus 249 (Apollo 9 CM) and Luminary 131 (Apollo 13 LM),
            as well as the somewhat-later Artemis 72.&nbsp; The scans
            (or the associated printouts from which the scans were made,
            or the destructive OCR processing done on them) for Colossus
            249 and Luminary 131 are <i>so</i> bad that the "efficient"
            proofing tool cannot be applied at all, while Artemis 72 is
            highly questionable.&nbsp; Thus, a different and more
            time-consuming proofing process was required.<br>
            <br>
            I have just completed proofing Colossus 249, and the results
            are available in GitHub now.&nbsp; What has been done with
            it is to note that Colossus 237 (which preceded it
            chronologically by a short time), and Comanche 55 (which
            followed it chronologically) had already been proofed using
            the "efficient tool".&nbsp; A 3-way side-by-side "diff"
            between the transcribed source code from these three AGC
            program versions was done.&nbsp; This highlighted places
            where errors (many, many errors) <i>might</i> exist.&nbsp;
            An extremely-large number of errors was corrected in
            Colossus 249 in this way, along with a (much smaller) number
            of errors that lingered in the already-proofed&nbsp;
            Colossus 237 and Comanche 55.<br>
            <br>
            This proofing process also benefited from the availability
            of an alternate scan of Colossus 249, not available
            originally, but available nowadays from the collection of
            AGC developer Fred Martin.&nbsp; Thus, many parts of the
            original scan that were garbled to the point of
            illegibility, could now be filled in with absolute
            certainty.<br>
            <br>
            More than you wanted to know, probably, but having just
            finished it, I'm still excited about it!&nbsp;
            :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            A similar 3-way proofing of Luminary 131's comment text
            awaits availability of comment-proofed source-code Luminary
            116 and Zerlina (derived from Luminary 145), neither of
            which is available now, but both of which are expected to be
            available within a few months.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for
            Artemis 72, the <i>last</i> Colossus version, there is no
            prospect of a 3-way diff with predecessor and successor
            versions, but merely a 2-way diff against a predecessor
            version that may not be a closely-related as we would hope,
            so it will probably come last of all.&nbsp; But we'll see
            what we'll see.<br>

            them, but it's always possible that problems might have been
            introduced in the process.&nbsp; Obviously, let me know if

            The licensing on all of the pages has also changed, from

            me (Ron Burkey), with all rights reserved, to <a
              href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">a
              Creative Commons No Rights Reserved license</a>.&nbsp;
            This is equivalent to being in the Public Domain in the
            U.S., and is the closest equivalent to that in parts of the
            world where the concept of the public domain is not
            recognized.&nbsp; I learned this from something Nina Paley
            wrote in connection to her marvelous animated film, <a
              href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/">Sita Sings the
              Blues</a> ... which, if you've not seen it, you
            should!&nbsp; She had originally released it for free under
            the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike License, which
            already was unbelievably brave, but still had the effect of
            reserving some legal rights for herself.&nbsp; But she later
            concluded that since she knew she wasn't going to sue
            anybody for breaching the license anyway, what was the point
            of reserving any rights?&nbsp; So she simply changed the
            licensing in the same manner I am doing now.&nbsp; (Of
            course, I don't claim to have to have the guts she does,
            since I derived no financial benefit from this website
            anyway, so the licensing is irrelevant to my checkbook.)<br>
            <br>
            Comparably gutsy to Nina's film is Kimiko Ishizaka's release

            the Art of Fugue, though Wikipedia claims that the
            Well-Tempered Clavier has indeed been released to the public
            domain as well.&nbsp; Kimiko is a German-Japanese, former
            Olympic bronze medalist in powerlifting, and concert

                  249</a> and <a href="ScansForConversion/Luminary131/">
                  Luminary 131</a> scanned material which we started
                with, way back in 2003, as well as the <a
                  href="ScansForConversion/Colossus249-Martin/">
                  improved replacement Colossus 249 scan we made of Fred
                  Martin's program listing</a>, has been completely
                restructured so that it conforms to the same pattern as
                all of <a href="ScansForConversion/">the other scanned
                  AGC program listings</a>: i.e., it now consists
                entirely of PNG files, one per each page numbered by the
                original assembler, and no PDF files at all.&nbsp; A
                side benefit is that while the original print/scan
                quality has naturally not improved, the quality of the
                images we're providing has nevertheless improved anyway,
                whilst decreasing the actual file sizes.&nbsp; At the
                same time, page-number references in the <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Colossus249">
                  Colossus 249</a> and <a
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Luminary131">
                  Luminary 131</a> transcribed source-code files, which
                previously corresponded to the PDF page-numbers in the
                gigantic now-irrelevant all-in-one PDF files downloaded
                from the now-defunct History of Recent Technology
                website, have been changed so that (like all other AGC
                source-code listings) they correspond to the page
                markings on the original printed pages of the program
                listings.&nbsp; My motivation for all of these changes
                is that I intend to begin proofing the comment text in
                the Colossus 249 and Luminary 131 source-code files by
                cross-comparing them with similar AGC versions like
                Colossus 237, Comanche 55, and Luminary 99; that kind of
                cross-checkout would have been greatly hampered without
                the changes.&nbsp; Moreover, if we manage to get Don
                Eyle's Luminary 131 listing (<a href="volunteer.html">which





















































































































































































































































                  we don't yet have a sponsor for</a>, by the way), the
                checking that that scan would enable would also have
                been hampered.&nbsp; However, even without such
                motivations, the overall effect of the changes is still
                to make the Colossus 249 and Luminary 131 material
                better and more accessible.</li>
              <li>I guess I've forgotten to mention <i>any</i> of the
                newspaper, magazine, or online articles in 2016 in which
                our Virtual AGC project played an important role.&nbsp;
                Of course, I don't necessarily know about all of them,
                since I don't spend a lot of time scouring the web for
                news about the project or about myself.&nbsp; The
                best-known is probably the article titled <a
href="https://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule/">
                  "BURN, BABY! BURN! The code that took America to the
                  moon was just published to GitHub, and it’s like a
                  1960s time capsule"</a> at Quartz.&nbsp; That one was
                fun for me, because various people stopped me or
                telephoned me to say "hey, is that you?"&nbsp; But for
                my taste, the article which has just appeared in the
                current issue of the U.K.'s <a
                  href="http://www.slow-journalism.com/">Delayed
                  Gratification magazine</a>, called "Houston, we have a
                program", is a lot more fun, for a number of
                reasons.&nbsp; Not least is that the article is really
                about our Virtual AGC project, rather than being
                primarily about Apollo 11 or the AGC software for Apollo
                11.&nbsp; But also, I think the article is extremely
                well-structured and entertaining, much more so than the
                endless, detailed blathering I output by the ton here at
                our website, so it's a fun read.&nbsp; I congratulate
                the writer, Chris Bourn, for the care he took, and the
                results he achieved.&nbsp; You may notice I've provided
                no link to the article, though.&nbsp; That's because
                Delayed Gratification is a print-only magazine,
                supported by subscribers rather than ads.&nbsp; They
                only put a handful of sample articles online; perhaps
                ours will some day be one of those (I hope!), but
                perhaps not.&nbsp; The magazine itself has a very
                intriguing concept: it is a proponent of something
                called "slow journalism", which is basically a throwback
                to the old days when journalists were supposed to do
                thorough fact checking, editors were supposed to edit,
                and so on, as opposed to today's situation, in which
                articles are thrown together as quickly as possible
                (probably by cutting-and-pasting unsubstantiated
                material), in order to maximize online ad revenue.&nbsp;
                In contrast, Delayed Gratification boasts that it is the
                <i>last</i> to break a story, rather than the <i>first</i>
                to do so. There's also an interesting TED talk about the
                concept of slow journalism:</li>

              <li>I had forgotten over the years that our digitized
                Luminary 99 (Apollo 11 LM software) was actually missing
                almost an entire page (bottom of p. 1472 and top of p.
                1473).&nbsp; Of course, we had immediately
                reverse-engineered this when we were transcribing the
                source code, and knew that our reconstruction assembled
                to the correct octal values, but it would still be nice
                to have the "correct" version.&nbsp; Fortunately, Don
                Eyles was able to supply snapshots (now on <a
                  href="Luminary.html">the Luminary page</a>) from his
                own printout.&nbsp; Gratifyingly, though not
                surprisingly, the reconstruction was 100% accurate,
                including the comments.&nbsp; (Actually, there was a
                typo in the comments, but ignore that; it was 100%
                perfect <i>in principle</i>.)</li>
              <li>Don has also supplied another LUMINARY Memo, #138, now
                in our document library.&nbsp; It describes the Variable
                Servicer then being implemented in ZERLINA.</li>

                  href="Colossus.html">Colossus</a> pages have had a
                sort of family-tree diagram for a while, in which the
                relationships amongst the various AGC programs were
                covered ... but only up to Apollo 11.&nbsp; I've taken
                it upon myself to recreate that diagram, and extend it
                all the way to the end of Apollo, by which I mean
                Apollo-Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz.&nbsp; It's a rather
                impressive picture, including even the science-project
                ZERLINA program, which was outside the main
                developmental flow; though even then, I'm told there
                were many other such separate programs, such as
                DIANA&nbsp; (about which I have a little info but not
                enough to include it in the chart), AMELIA, and so on.</li>

                <li>While in the past (and continuing into the future!),
                  we've taken great pains to insure that the functional
                  source code and executable versions of the AGC program
                  versions we present here are 100% accurate, we've had
                  no tools at our disposal and much less luck at
                  insuring that the <i>comments</i> in these programs
                  are accurate transcriptions from the original.&nbsp;
                  This situation has changed somewhat, and we do in fact
                  have a proofing tool at our disposal now that makes
                  proofing the program comments both much more efficient
                  and much more reliable, for those program versions to
                  which it can be applied.&nbsp; I will write much more
                  about this in the future, but for right now I'll
                  merely note that SUNBURST 120 (Apollo 5) and AURORA
                  have already been through this process, with around
                  1000 errors fixed in AURORA and around 3000 fixed in
                  SUNBURST.&nbsp; COMANCHE 55 (Apollo 11 CM) is about
                  halfway through this process (according to GitHub
                  logs), and while I've lost count at the moment, I
                  think the errors fixed in its comments already top
                  5000.&nbsp; It should be noted that these fixes affect
                  only the <i>text</i>, without regard to the columnar
                  alignment (which will hopefully be addressed in the
                  future).&nbsp; Most of these fixes are trivial
                  matters, such as the presence or absence of a '.', so
                  the huge numbers of fixes aren't necessarily alarming
                  as it seems superficially.&nbsp; The goal is for the
                  program comments in our source-code files to exactly
                  match the original assembly listings, right down to
                  misspellings and typos.&nbsp; These improvements are
                  currently available in GitHub, and will continue to
                  become available as the process progresses.</li>

                how to do it. (But Windows and Linux are still okay,

                Of course, I announced the AURORA 12 rope nearly a month
                ago, but for some curious reason failed to emphasize it
                as I normally do for new AGC versions, so I'm doing that

                few days as well, though I forgot to update this
                change-log. In both cases, you still have to explicitly
                build the rope from the corresponding "binsource" file —
                "oct2bin &lt;Sunburst120.binsource" or "oct2bin
                &lt;Aurora12.binsource" — (with the rope being
                oct2bin.bin afterward), but you can do that and run
                either or both in yaAGC if you're of a mind to do
                so.&nbsp; In both cases, the source-code transcription
                is making progress, but isn't yet ready, so this is the
                only option if you want to run one of these programs
                right now rather than waiting for full availability. </div>

            the point where that symbol is defined.&nbsp; This is a big
            help, I think, because previously you actually had to know
            which file the symbol was defined in, and now you do not.<br>

                found some problems with boundary cases in the <tt>DV</tt>
                instruction, and perhaps some not-so-boudary-case
                problems elsewhere (such as the lack of a hardware
                "night watchman" mechanism), and has fixed them all in
                yaYUL.&nbsp; Thanks also to Niklas Beug for faithfully
                testing these in NASSP, to insure that they don't cause
                problems there, or perhaps make stuff better that seemed
                to be working before.&nbsp; Thus, yaYUL (and I think,
                Mike's sim) now pass the AURORA test suite.&nbsp; (Of
                course, there are aspects of the test suite that aren't
                CPU-specific, I believe, such as IMU tests, and I don't
                claim that those pass.)&nbsp; At any rate, Mike has also

                of the characters (like '—', 'μ', '±', etc.) were messed
                up on the ibiblio version but not on the GitHub version.
                I finally figured out how to override ibiblio's
                override, so I should be able to start pushing changes
                to ibiblio.org/apollo again.</li>

              <li>The hopefully fully-correct Aurora 12 rope is now
                available at our GitHub repo, though the transcribed
                source code for Aurora isn't yet available, so at least
                theoretically you can run Aurora in the AGC
                simulator.&nbsp; However, that would have to be done
                from yaAGC's command line, since Aurora 12 capability
                has not yet been integrated into the VirtualAGC GUI
                program.</li>
              <li>Niklas Beug has been developing a new feature for us,

                What these scenarios are "core dumps" — exact copies of
                the AGC's "erasable memory" — with the appropriate pad
                loads and setups for running simulations of various
                mission scenarios. These core dumps are accompanied by
                nice writeups of what they are and how to use them. By
                loading the core dump into the AGC simulator, you're all
                set to go with the corresponding scenario!&nbsp; At the
                moment, there are only 4 scenarios, namely the Apollo 9,
                11, and 15 launch scenarios and the Apollo 7 rendezvous
                scenario (and yes, that's a real thing!), but presumably
                the number will grow.&nbsp; Eventually, this feature
                will be integrated into the VirtualAGC GUI program, but
                for now it's command-line only.&nbsp; Also, the setups
                come from NASSP, so you may find it more fulfilling to
                use them with NASSP then with "pure" Virtual AGC.<br>

            At least, they were long-awaited for <i>me</i>, because
            until today I saw them for the first and last time almost 12
            years ago to the day, and that's why there's no hair left on
            my head.&nbsp; (That's my theory, anyway.)<br>
            <br>
            But also, on a separate note, it has slowly dawned on me
            that I don't have AGC electrical schematics on our
            document-library page.&nbsp; I thought I did, but I
            don't!&nbsp; (No wonder I can never find them.)&nbsp; The
            Block II schematics, as contributed by Eldon Hall, have been
            on the klabs.org site for many years, but since NASA no
            longer funds it, that site is unfortunately now essentially
            a zombie and one wonders how much longer it will
            persist.&nbsp; So as of today, I'm now mirroring all
            relevant AGC material from that site here, in <a
              href="links.html">our document library</a>.&nbsp; The
            highlights of the additions are:<br>

                Blair-Smith, Ray Alonso, and Eldon Hall (as well as
                Frank O'Brien, Cline Frasier, and Jose Portillo Lugo) at
                the MAPLD '04 conference.</li>
              <li>Various new documents or cleaner versions of ones we
                already have, most-notably perhaps, an Apollo 16 Delco
                manual to supplement the existing A15 Delco manual, and
                a clean replacement for the mutilated-but-indispensable

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It also seems that there may be a perception on the part
              of the AGC modeling community, if there is such a thing,
              that the available Block II AGC schematics are so
              incomplete that constructing a hardware Block II AGC sim
              is impossible.&nbsp; (That's why, I've been told, everyone
              continues to do Block I sims.)&nbsp; Well, Mike Stewart
              has certainly made a Block II sim that's good enough to
              help him track down and fix bugs in our own software sim,
              so while the Block II schematics may not be perfect, they
              are certainly not so incomplete as to prevent using them
              for this kind of project.&nbsp; And here are Mike's links
              to prove it:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <div> <a

            As it happens, Mike has given me his evaluation of the
            completeness/incompleteness of the Block II AGC schematics,
            and I provide that assessment in the document library as
            well, for anyone interested in this kind of thing.<br>

                    bugs in the Block 2 AGC simulator.&nbsp; As you may
                    know, the NASSP add-on for the Orbiter spacecraft
                    simulator has incorporated our AGC simulator for
                    many years. Until the last year or so, they have
                    been using it just for the Command Module
                    (apparently without difficulties), but have lately
                    begun trying to do lunar landings with it and have
                    been prevented due to the alarms and other problems
                    caused by the AGC simulator.&nbsp; However, with the
                    latest fixes, I'm told that they are indeed able to
                    accomplish a lunar landing without alarms.&nbsp;

            It is, unfortunately, unclear if the code can ever be run in
            the AGC simulator or not, but I'll think about it for a
            while before saying "no".<br>
            <br>
            Second, and perhaps more importantly even though I haven't
            chosen to color it red, I was wrong in one very significant
            way about Francois Rautenbach's extractions of the
            rope-memory contents, and that is that it was <i>not</i>
            from Apollo 6 (<b>Solarium 055</b>) as I said, but rather is
            the <b>Corona</b> program from the AS-202 ("Apollo 3")
            mission, which we do not have already, and have no other
            prospects for acquiring.&nbsp; Moreover, it is simply in the
            form of stored electrical waveforms rather than a file of
            numbers representing the values stored at various memory
            locations.&nbsp; But perhaps it could be converted, and
            perhaps the <b>Corona</b> binary can be reverse-engineered
            back into the form of source code, which we will do if at
            all possible and present it here.&nbsp; So stay tuned.<br>

                files in 2010.&nbsp; However, proofing of the
                source-code files and of the binary were never completed
                at that time, though the binary was proofed to the

                of luck viewing previous years.&nbsp; On the other hand,
                both this feature and the Google Search bar updated
                yesterday are both completely self-contained (i.e., they
                don't load additional files of javascript), so it's a
                pretty safe feature!<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> I've been very lax about
            updating this site, and so have a pretty large backlog of
            stuff to deal with that people have sent me and that has
            just been sitting on my to-do list.&nbsp; Sorry about
            that!&nbsp; First, a status report:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>I've <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
                  bold;">not</span> completed the process of porting the
                Gemini catch-up and rendezvous simulation program so
                that it can be run in a modern machine-independent
                Fortran.&nbsp; The problem (aside from my general
                laziness) is that the program does some stuff very
                specific to the IBM 704/7090/7094 which I don't
                understand, and therefore don't understand how to
                port.&nbsp; If there's anyone with the time and energy
                (or shockingly, the expertise) to handle this, I'd be
                grateful.&nbsp; Alternatively, there's a generally
                available simulator for that IBM computer system, and
                getting the program running on the simulator would also
                be a very interesting alternative.</li>
              <li>With various people's help (principally Mikael
                Uvebrandt and Jim Lawton), the Apollo 8 code (Colossus
                237) is almost ready for use, but not quite.&nbsp; It
                just requires some effort from me to close the gap and
                get it working.&nbsp; Keep your fingers crossed on this
                one.</li>
              <li>Helmuth Litfin has created software which he calls the
                "Ultimate DSKY Simulator", which (surprise!) is intended
                to be a DSKY simulation that is accurate in terms of
                physical dimensions and appearance, and more accurate in
                terms of behavior than my yaDSKY program.&nbsp; For
                example, in terms of the former, the Ultimate SDKY would
                appear on your computer screen with the same physical
                dimensions as a real DSKY.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the
                simulator is Windows-only and is not open source, and
                I'm not aware of it being presently available for use,
                so I can't actually give you a link to it; but I have
                seen a preliminary version almost (but not quite) worked
                with yaAGC.&nbsp; This is significant because the brief
                evaluation did reveal certain flaws in the behavior of
                yaDSKY, which Helmuth has explained to me in terms of
                the DSKY schematics, and therefore will probably have to
                be fixed at some point.&nbsp; The flaw relate
                principally to the DSKY's "standby" mode, and the manner
                in which the DSKY enters or leaves standby mode.&nbsp; I
                can't promise a time-frame for the fixes.&nbsp; If
                anybody is interested in the meantime, I can relate the
                details to you.<br>

                he created.&nbsp; This pretty-extensive introduction has

                sending the update and thus adding to my workload at a
                time when there seemed to be an "explosion of
                activity".&nbsp; (Pretty ironic, right?)&nbsp; I've now
                added those very extensive updates.</li>
              <li>At the same time, Dimitris also sent along a number of
                photos of various things in his personal collection
                which may be of interest, including bits and pieces of a
                block 1 AGC and DSKY, an LVDC, and an RCA-110A

                snapshot 20060110 was found to be in error, and was
                corrected in one place!&nbsp; The conversion to source
                was done by Hartmuth Gutsche, Onno Hommes, Jim Lawton,
                and Sergio Navarro, but Jim took it upon himself to

                    bold;">yaYUL</span>.&nbsp; There are several mods
                  needed, the principal one being that John's assembler
                  doesn't have the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
                  limitation of 8-character upper-case labels.</li>
                <li>Rather than directly accessing the DSKY via i/o
                  channels, the code assumes the presence of some
                  Colossus code (including the executive) to manage this
                  activity.&nbsp; Figuring out just what portions of
                  Colossus to prune away to get room for the games is
                  quite tricky.&nbsp; It was done this way because John
                  envisaged the game pack as an add-on to Colossus ... a
                  kind of in-flight entertainment system.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
                  However, for our purposes you could just as easily
                  eliminate all of the Colossus code and directly access
                  the DSKY.<br>

                equivalent is on an operating-system by operating-system
                basis) when the custom name is blank.&nbsp; It also
                doesn't allow directory-changes to bleed through between
                the different types of file-dialogs as it has been doing
                on some platforms.</li>
              <li>Custom AGC/AEA code in the main GUI (<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>):&nbsp;
                You were previously able to assemble source code and run
                from here, but you couldn't do symbolic debugging or
                browse the source-code listing.&nbsp; In other words,
                the main GUI is now almost a one-stop shop for assembly
                and command-line debugging.&nbsp; You still have to
                provide your own editor or, if you want GUI-based
                debugging in Code::Blocks (for instance), you still need
                to do some manual stuff outside the GUI.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Added Alberto Galdo's mods (thanks, Alberto!) for
                building <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                for an iPhone.&nbsp; Now, <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span> without a DSKY obviously doesn't
                do very much, though in theory you could still run and
                debug AGC code from a command line (if the iPhone has
                such a thing).&nbsp; Since I don't have an iPhone and
                haven't bothered as of yet to download an iPhone
                development kit it's an open question if I've properly
                implemented Alberto's changes, but at least it's a
                start.&nbsp; There are some instructions on the <a
                  href="download.html#iPhone">download page</a> for
                building it.</li>
              <li>Added some proofing for Luminary 99 done by Steve
                Case.&nbsp; (Thanks, Steve!)</li>
              <li>The volunteer team (who will all be acknowledged later
                when the Artemis072 source code is completely available)
                have added various Artemis072 source files, as well as
                making some corrections to existing Luminary099 and
                Comanche055 source files.</li>

              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> has
                been fixed so that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
                249 is identified with Apollo 9 rather than Apollo
                8.&nbsp; The good news here is that I am now expecting <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 237 (for
                Apollo 8) to actually be available soon, so we aren't
                really losing Apollo 8.</li>
              <li>The naming of all AGC source files has been changed
                from *.s to *.agc; that of all AEA source files has been
                changed from *.s to *.aea; that of all HTML files
                created from source has been changed from *.html to
                *.agc.html or *.aea.html.&nbsp; This has been done to
                play nicely with the AGA/AEA syntax highlighting which
                Google has been nice enough to add.&nbsp; I hope that I
                have tracked down all associated links on this website
                and fixed them, but I may have missed a few.&nbsp;

            It has been only partially proofed—less so than Comanche
            055—and so I won't feel great confidence until another

                I promise you that with this snapshot I tried native
                builds in Linux, Win32 XP, Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 7.2,

                true, but I doubt anyone would see the difference unless
                they did a side-by-side comparison and zoomed in by
                about 3:1 or 4:1.&nbsp; The orginal giant PDFs&nbsp;
                (without the improvements I made in them) are still
                available elsewhere online if you want them.&nbsp; This
                change has been made to be more consistent with Comanche
                055 and Luminary 099, to make it easier for anyone who
                might want to volunteer to proof the program comments,
                and simply to reduce the disk space taken up.&nbsp; Not
                that ibiblio.org has complained or anything, but there's

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>.&nbsp;
                In other words, Onno made debugging AGC programs a lot
                nicer.&nbsp; The source trees have now been
                re-merged.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                debugging has switched entirely to the new method, and
                the "classic" method previously described on the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> page has been
                eliminated.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                debugging is still undergoing change in this direction.</li>
              <li>When command-line debugging of AGC/AGS programs is
                being done, both <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now
                use <span style="font-weight: bold;">readline</span>
                style command-editing and command-histories on all
                platforms.&nbsp; I had been unable to provide this
                feature on several platforms previously.<br>
              </li>
              <li>There is now a native-Windows build procedure listed
                on the download page, again thanks to Onno.</li>
              <li>The FreeBSD native build procedure may or may not be
                broken.&nbsp; I can't tell, because I've broken my
                FreeBSD installation.</li>
              <li>I've reduced some 30-second startup delays I
                introduced in the last snapshot to 5 seconds.&nbsp; The
                delays were based on the worst-case characteristics of
                some very slow test machines I am using, but aren't
                necessary for more-normal computers.&nbsp; I've instead
                added some configuration instructions to the download
                page if someone should need the longer delays.</li>
              <li>The cross-build instructions given in previous
                snapshots were wrong, in that some aspects would work
                only if my username and directory setup were used.&nbsp;
                Hopefully this is fixed now.<br>

              <li>Configuration of the joystick for the ACA simulation,
                though simplified from previous times, was still
                annoyingly intricate.&nbsp; I've added small GUI program
                called <span style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> to
                hopefully simplify the configuration process and bring
                it a little closer to where it needs to be.&nbsp;
                There's a button marked "Handler" next to the <span

                that enables the ACA, and clicking the button calls up <span

              <li>I've also managed to fix the annoying characteristic
                of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> that
                it couldn't display console output in Windows, and thus
                you couldn't see the information you actually needed for
                the joystick calibration.&nbsp; But it still doesn't
                work in Windows in spite of that, because after its
                window loses focus it never sees any more joystick
                events.<br>
              </li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>
                program, which has a joystick driver based on <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span>, has been
                added.&nbsp; So there are 3 separate ACA simulations to
                choose from, and hopefully at least one of them will
                work for you.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>
                doesn't seem to work in Mac OS X (though I believe I
                recall that it did originally), so at least for now it's
                disabled there.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A lot of work has been done in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> to
                display digital-downlink data in a format that would
                more closely correspond to the way ground control data
                was displayed in actual missions.&nbsp; The associated
                display formats are designated by the names MSK-683,
                MSK-966, MSK-1123, and MSK-1137.&nbsp; However, I don't
                have it actually working yet, so the extra controls
                which have been added to <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaTelemetry</span> for this purpose are
                disabled and grayed-out at present.</li>
              <li>In the Mac OS X version, it hasn't previously been
                possible to run <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                or <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in
                debugging mode—and wouldn't have been possible to
                configure the joystick using <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">jWiz</span>—because of the lack of any
                command-line switches in the native <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Terminal</span> program and
                the practical inability to use <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">xterm</span> properly on
                the 10.4 and 10.3 platforms.&nbsp; Therefore, on the Mac
                platform we automatically include an open-source
                terminal program called <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Terminator</span>, which allows <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> to add back all
                of the missing functionality. It still isn't possible to
                use the debugger in 10.3, but it seems to be fine now in
                10.4 and 10.5.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Discovered (and fixed) that the endian conversions
                added previously to make symbol tables portable between
                Intel and PowerPC platforms weren't yet working.</li>
              <li>On the links page I've added a new document, the "<a

                  Control System Mathematical Subroutine Manual</a>".&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































                Don't get too excited, because it's not what you think
                it is: the "mathematical subroutines" are algorithms for
                multiplication, division, trig functions, etc.&nbsp;

            (hand-controller) simulation not working on some versions of
            Mac OS X, so I have made a change.&nbsp; Instead of always
            using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
            simulation program (which superceded the earlier <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> simulation program
            for snapshots 20090331 and later), the <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI front-end
            now allows for using <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
            and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> somewhat
            interchangeably.&nbsp; Basically, it will use <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> unless it notices
            that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> has been
            configured, and then it will use <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">yaACA</span> instead.&nbsp; The <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> program has also
            been tricked up similarly to the <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">yaACA3</span> program in that it now automatically
            saves its joystick-related switches to a configuration file,
            so that they become the defaults at the next run. &nbsp; <a
              href="yaTelemetry.html#yaACA">Read about it in detail</a>
            if you have experienced a non-functional joystick.&nbsp;

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">I fixed the FreeBSD bugs
            mentioned yesterday, and am now willing to say that Virtual
            AGC works in FreeBSD.&nbsp; Instructions for building from
            source on FreeBSD have been added to the <a
              href="download.html#FreeBSD">download page</a>.&nbsp; I'd
            be lying, though, if I said it was thoroughly tested.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, I only have FreeBSD running in a virtual
            machine, and the marriage of FreeBSD (PC-BSD) to VirtualBox
            has not proved a happy one for me, so my ability to test the
            the FreeBSD installation is very crude.&nbsp; When I say
            Virtual AGC "works", I mean that I can run <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, that I can
            start the simulation, that I can put in verbs and nouns on
            the DSKY and it does what I expect it to do, that I can see
            telemetry downlinks, and that I can perform digital
            uplinks.&nbsp; If anyone wants to send me more data, I'd be
            happy to see it, but I've done all I expect to do on the
            FreeBSD side in the absence of feedback.<br>

            Mirko Mattioli, and Onno Hommes.&nbsp; Some important <span

            made to material on the the website itself, thanks to
            Fabrizio Bernardini:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>We now know with a higher degree of certainty that
                Luminary 1E build 210 was flown in Apollo 17 (and
                probably Apollo 15-16), whereas before there was some
                dispute that it might have instead been Luminary 1D
                build 209.&nbsp; This is significant in the sense that
                we're aware of a listing for 1D (and may even get a copy
                of it someday), but we're not aware of the existence of
                a copy of 1E.&nbsp; As to what the differences between
                1D and 1E are, that will await future revelations!&nbsp;
                Perhaps there are none.<br>
              </li>
              <li>We are now aware that AGS Flight Program 8 was used in
                Apollo 15-17, rather than in Apollo 14 as previously
                supposed.&nbsp; This is significant because we actually
                have a copy of Flight Program 8 included within the
                project, and it's good to know what we have!<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            Software-wise, lots of bugs have been fixed and auxiliary
            changes associated with those fixes have been made, so that
            I'm not even sure I remember them all.&nbsp; Here are some
            of the ones that stand out in my mind as particularly
            significant:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>There was an issue in sequencing key-releases with
                shifting of buffered keypad data in communications
                between <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA/yaDEDA2</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>,
                which could basically break AGS communications,
                requiring a reboot of the simulation to fix it.&nbsp;
                The effect was fairly repeatable if the HOLD key was hit
                and then the READ OUT key was hit.&nbsp; I *hope* it's
                fixed now.&nbsp; A new --debug-deda switch in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> helped me find
                this one.</li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> --debug
                modes were crippled using the as-distributed symbol
                tables for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>,
                because they embedded path names to the source-code
                files that were set at compile time ... in other words,
                for the symtabs I've been distributing, they pointed to
                source files in directories on <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">my</span> computer.</li>
              <li>Moreover, the symbol tables used the natural
                endianness of the CPU, meaning that symbol tables
                generated on an Intel architecture would not work if I
                distributed them to a PowerPC architecture.</li>
              <li>There was a bug in the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span> core-dump and --resume, in which
                half the time resuming from a core-dump would cause the
                DSKY to become non-responsive.&nbsp; My believe is that
                some state information (probably relating to interrupts)
                was not being saved in the core-dumps.</li>
              <li>I think there was a bug in direction flags
                (displacement direction of the control stick from
                detent) sent to the AGC by <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaACA</span> when more than one axis was
                displaced.&nbsp; The bug carried over into <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> (see below)
                as well, but I fixed it in both places.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            In terms of new features, again there are lots.&nbsp; Some
            of the more significant ones are:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> has
                also been given a capability not present in any software
                existing previously to the GUI, in that it can perform
                scripted Digital Uplinks to the AGC.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
                integrates AGC/AEA compilation and source-code browsing,
                in addition to merely managing the simulation.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> have been
                modified so that when in --debug mode they no longer
                output status messages like socket connections or
                disconnections of peripherals, thus giving an "easier"
                to understand debugging experience.</li>
            </ul>
            While it is basically a feature-neutral change, the ACA
            emulation program <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
            has been superceded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>,
            principally to allow the use <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">SDL</span> rather than <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">Allegro</span> for providing the joystick
            interface.&nbsp; The initial motivation for this was that
            Paul Fjeld (thanks, Paul!) advised that <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>'s joystick code was
            more stable than <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span>'s





















































































































































































































































            on Mac OS X.&nbsp; However, having made this replacement, I
            find some other significant advantages, the two principal
            being that there is far less configuration burden (and what
            configuration there is I've integrated in a way that won't
            be painful for <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>),





















































































































































































































































            and that I find I hadn't noticed before that <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> provides
            absolutely no console feedback on Windows, making debugging
            that much more painful.&nbsp; I've also taken the
            opportunity to use static linking for <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>, to avoid
            distributing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span>'s

            This program will additionally have convenient installers
            for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, which is something which
            has been lacking up to now.&nbsp; At the same time, I've
            fixed the problem that (as previously installed by Virtual
            AGC) Stephan Hotto's <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
            module didn't have its various very-useful help screens.<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">The current development
            snapshot fixes a bug which has existed since 2007-03-16 in
            the development snapshots, but not in any of the binary
            downloads (since I've not posted new versions of the binary
            downloads in that time period).&nbsp; The bug, very simply,
            is that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
            module would abort if used in a CM simulation, even though
            it would work in an LM simulation.&nbsp; The upshot of this
            is that if you tried to start a CM simulation using any of
            the provided scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span>,
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249_lite</span>,

              style="font-weight: bold;">SimArtemis072_lite</span>) then
            the simulation would abort with an error message.&nbsp; I
            suspect that some folks have complained to me about this and
            that I blew them off with an explanation that there was
            something misconfigured about their computers.&nbsp; If you
            complained and I ignored it, I apologize.<br>
            <br>
            Development of Virtual AGC has been on hold for a while, but
            I expect it to pick up again soon, with a vengeance.&nbsp;

            both in source code and in the Windows "stand-alone"
            executable version, with the following notes:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>FDAI now fully functional! The attitude looks a bit
                confusing around \B190 degrees Yaw but that is for the
                reason that LM_Simulator does not uses a real
                3-dimensional ball to show the attitude. Please keep in
                mind that the LM-IMU has its Gimbal Lock Condition on
                the Roll-Axis and not on the Yaw-Axis like the Command
                Module has.</li>
              <li>A Checkbutton in the FDAI window now allows to switch
                off the 8-Ball for computers with low performance.&nbsp;
                [LM_Simulator's CPU performance has been greatly
                improved from a month or two ago, but you still might
                like to reduce it some, and updating the 8-ball is the
                majority of the CPU time used by LM_Simulator.&nbsp;
                Thus, the option for switching it off.]<br>
              </li>
              <li>FDAI angles are additionally presented as numerical
                values.</li>

                  lower value if you experience performance problems.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>New HTML documentation as well as re-work of the
                existing documents.&nbsp; [The HTML documentation is in

              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                now has its own RHC/ACA (Rotational Hand Controller) and

              style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> update,
            which he describes as follows:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Now the FDAI shows the
              correct 8-ball angles - currently with a limitation to:<br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Yaw: 0Deg \B190Deg<br>
                Pitch: 0Deg \B190Deg<br>
                Roll: Anyway limited by the Gimbal Lock condition at
                0Deg \B185Deg<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              The functionality of the DAP and the dynamic model as well
              as the displayed FDAI angles can be verified by using the
              "Crew Defined Maneuver Routine V49". By initiating this
              routine you must provide the desired destination IMU
              Gimbal Angles, subsequently the AGC presents you with the
              associated FDAI angles it steers the LM to (please refer
              to the Tutorial). Because of the above mentioned
              limitation those FDAI angles should be in the defined
              range.&nbsp; [By the "tutorial", Stephan means the
              Contributed/LM_Simulator/tutorial.txt, which you'll get by

                The AGC architecture allows for a wacky feature using
                the <span style="font-family: monospace;">BRUPT</span>
                register, in which an interrupt-service routine can
                place in instruction into <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">BRUPT</span> to be executed upon return
                from interrupt.&nbsp; In other words, the instruction
                executed upon return from an interrupt doesn't have to
                be the instruction that's at the location to which the
                program returns.&nbsp; I had implemented this feature,
                but couldn't figure out why anyone would want to do
                anything so crazy, and so disabled it by default.&nbsp;
                'x15' of the group which has integrated Virtual AGC into
                the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span>
                spacecraft simulator has discovered that this feature <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">does</span> need to be
                activated for proper operation, as the multi-tasking
                performed by the program executive makes use of
                it.&nbsp; The effect of turning off this feature is that
                the digital autopilot will hit the dreaded <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">EDRUPT</span>
                instruction, and hence reset the AGC from time to
                time.&nbsp; Hence, it is now activated by default.&nbsp;
                (You can get this feature without a new download by
                compiling Virtual AGC with the command "make
                -DALLOW_BSUB".)<br>

                Stephan Hotto has sent in a major update, v. 0.8, that
                he describes as follows:</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>Critical Bug Fixes!!!</li>

                the coordination transformation between Pilot axes and
                Stable Member axes.</li>

                processor</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Additionally, Stephan tells
              us:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The DAP is now stable
                around all axes and even the "DAP V49 Crew Defined
                Maneuver" routine steers the LM exactly into the right
                orientation.<br>
                <br>
                There was a major bug in the IMU coordination
                transformation that caused the DAP instabilities.<br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, to handle single RCS jet events it was
                necessary to transform the U,V jet system into the P,Q,R
                pilot axes.<br>
                <br>
                The whole dynamical model of the LM is now based on the
                equations used for the DAP state estimator. This
                approach makes the model very precise and comparable to
                the real thing.<br>
                <br>
                To assure the right AGC initialization it is necessary
                to stick to the following pre-conditions and steps:<br>

                  "slow" count at 400 counts per second.&nbsp; This

                Provides a complementary feature to yesterday's <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> update,
                in that it internally buffers all PCDU or MCDU commands
                to the CDUX, CDUY, and CDUZ counter registers, and
                actually applies them to the counters at an 800 cps
                rate.&nbsp; In other words, the simulated IMU can feed
                in new angle measurements as fast as it likes, but they
                are now applied to the simulated AGC's internal counters
                only at an 800 cps rate.&nbsp; The reason for this is
                that the real IMU communicated with the real AGC using
                an 800 cps signal, and the digital autopilot (DAP) in
                the Luminary/Colossus software employs a digital filter
                based on this assumed counter update rate.&nbsp; The
                filter was intended to eliminate electrical noise and or
                noisy angles due to the vibration of the spacecraft, but
                it also has been causing rejection of changes to the
                CDUX, CDUY, and CDUZ counters that don't conform to the
                assumed 800 cps timing.&nbsp; Consequently, the
                simulated IMU has been feeding info on the spacecraft
                orientation to the simulated CPU, but the DAP has been
                rejecting this info.&nbsp; I don't claim that this
                change has been extensively tested, though, and an
                erasable pad load is needed to set the DAP's "Kalman
                filter" characteristics, or else the CDU inputs will
                continue to be rejected anyhow.&nbsp; (But I don't quite
                know what those pad loads are yet.)&nbsp; Thanks, as
                usual, to Stephan for figuring this out.<br>

                about that.)&nbsp; Here are the changes:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Documentation revised</li>
                <li>Code clean up</li>
                <li>Changed the switch handling of the DAP Mode Switch
                  within the Crew Switch Window.</li>
                <li>Rotational Model Moment of Inertia Calculation bases
                  now on the same hyperbola equation as used by the AGC
                  state estimator<br>
                </li>
                <li>Roll, Pitch and Yaw Rate-Indicators added. In the
                  real LM the data for these indicators came from the
                  fixed mounted gyro rate assembly unit.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Error Needles added. The data shown by the error
                  needles can be switched between 3 modes:<br>
                  <ol>
                    <li>DSKY: V61E -&gt; DISPLAY DAP FOLLOWING ATTITUDE
                      ERRORS. This is the standard mode. The needles
                      show how far the DAP is away from the wished axes
                      positions.</li>
                    <li>DSKY: V62E -&gt; DISPLAY TOTAL ATTITUDE ERRORS
                      WITH RESPECT TO NOUN 22.&nbsp; Here the needles
                      display the absolute difference between the entry
                      shown by V16N22E and V16N20E. Normally used for
                      automatic positioning.</li>
                    <li>DSKY: V60E -&gt; DISPLAY VEHICLE ATTITUDE RATES
                      ON FDAI ERROR NEEDLES. These outputs should
                      provide the same information as the FDAI rate
                      indicators do. The Roll, Yaw and Pitch rate shown
                      by the FDAI bases on a separate Rate Gyro Assembly
                      fixed mounted to the LM body, whereas the
                      Information on the needles shown by V60E is
                      derived from the AGC measurement of the angular
                      changes. This is also a backup mode in case of a
                      Rate Gyro Assembly Fault.</li>

                Stephan has sent us a new version, designated
                v0.5.&nbsp; Here are the changes:</li>

                <li>Stage Separation</li>
                <li>Ascent Engine (Veryfication shows that the engine
                  exactly reaches the defined delta V).</li>
                <li>Extension of the config file by adding the ascent
                  engine parameter</li>

                people have pointed out to me that Virtual AGC no longer
                builds properly on their *nix systems, because of new
                dependencies I've forgotten to document.&nbsp; Namely,
                you now need "readline-devel" and "curses" (or else
                "ncurses" with a symbolic link making it appear to be
                "curses").&nbsp; Now documented in the build
                instructions.<br>

                A lot of changes, thanks to Stephan Hotto.&nbsp; You
                should particularly note the changes to the tutorial (in
                the Contributed/LM_Simulator/doc directory).&nbsp;
                Here's what Stephan has to say about it:<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <ul>
                <li>Used the new LM-Coordinates to re-code the whole
                  IMU-Module</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>IMU Coarse Align</li>
                  <li>IMU Fine Align</li>
                  <li>PIPA Vectors</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Gimbal Lock (Middle Gimbal) on LM-Z-Axis (Roll-Axis)</li>
                <li>Complete re-work of the RCS Thruster handling:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>4 Thruster Mode along X, Y, Z axes</li>
                  <li>2 Thruster Mode (Minimum Impulse Mode) along X, Y,
                    Z, U, V axes</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Remark: THC (Crew-Inputs) activates the correct
                  thrusters to translate the LM along the X,Y,Z axes.
                  This increase in speed is not jet reflected within the
                  IMU PIPAs.</li>
                <li>Update of the tutorial to reflect the DAP mode and
                  data load routines.</li>
              </ul>
              The summary of these changes is that for some time we've
              been trying to correctly match all of the various thrust
              and rotational axes of the simulation with the axes
              assumed by the Luminary and Colossus, and hopefully have
              them all correct now. However,&nbsp; the DAP is not yet
              stabilizing the LM even after loading the correct data
              (e.g. LM weight) as in the updated tutorial. It just
              bounces back and forth around the desired orientation,
              until it runs out of fuel.&nbsp; Obviously, we're still
              working on figuring that out!<br>

                directed to Stephan's real tutorial in the development
                snapshot.&nbsp; (It was too hard to keep the two in
                sync.)<br>

                (Thanks to Stephan Hotto.)&nbsp; The mapping of
                pitch/yaw/roll axes to thruster/joystick axes has been
                modified.&nbsp; The ATTITUDE HOLD mode thus now actually
                works (and attempts to hold the attitude) rather than
                merely allowing thrusters to fire.&nbsp; However, there
                is an overcompensation, so that the attitude overshoots,
                resulting in continual corrections and eventual
                exhaustion of fuel.&nbsp; This may be due to mismatch
                between the AGC's and IMU's assumptions about the LM's
                inertial characteristics.&nbsp; At any rate, it's a big
                improvement, but we haven't crossed the finish line yet.<br>

                The freeze-up problem in ATTITUDE HOLD mode has been
                fixed, I hope.&nbsp; For anyone who has been holding off
                on downloading new development snapshots, I think it's
                okay to do so now.<br>

                In "--debug" mode, a "WATCH A V" command has been added,

                <li>The current version of yaAGC has a mysterious
                  problem.&nbsp; I'm not sure when this problem
                  began.&nbsp; (I suspect the underlying problem was
                  always present, but that it was masked by other
                  problems in versions 20050814 and prior, so that it
                  was not noticeable.)&nbsp; The problem can be observed
                  as follows:&nbsp; Suppose you run <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary131</span>, then
                  you activate ATTITUDE HOLD mode, then you use the hand
                  controller to fire the thrusters.&nbsp; At some later
                  time, you'll find that the AGC has become largely
                  unresponsive, though it still responds in an automatic
                  way to certain stimuli.&nbsp; The only way of
                  recovering from this is to restart the
                  simulation.&nbsp; Fixing this problem is my top
                  priority at present.</li>

                Stephan has sent over a new version, differing

                Christian Bucher has fixed an embarrassing bug for
                me.&nbsp; (For arithmetic with a double-precision
                negative value in which the less-significant word was
                +0, the more-significant word would have been
                arbitrarily converted to -0.&nbsp; Admittedly, I don't
                know if this situation ever occurred in practice, but
                it's great to have it fixed.)&nbsp; Also, Markus Joachim
                has sent a fix for timing in some output pulses
                generated by the CPU; the timing error was not
                perceptible in a human sense, but caused some program
                alarms in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in Win32, has
                changed its library-naming, so that you can't use newer
                versions of this library without manually editing a
                couple of Virtual AGC makefiles.&nbsp; The stock Virtual
                AGC makefiles now auto-select a Pthreads-w32 library
                version in a way that's hopefully adequate to obviate
                the need for manual editing.&nbsp; Note that I've not
                personally had the chance yet to try it out with the
                newer versions of Pthreads-w32, so your mileage may

                integration.&nbsp; (Thanks to Mark Grant.)&nbsp;
                Specifically, header-file changes have been made that
                should allow you to link Virtual AGC libraries to C++

                mode, that we didn't notice that the regular (non-debug)

                didn't work unless <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                was built without readline support.&nbsp; Jordan has now

                care of some build-platform-specific dependencies in

                those of you who think my Win32 build instructions seem
                too complex, Virtual AGC now seems to build with <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span>.&nbsp;
                (Warning:&nbsp; I haven't yet gotten the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span> library to
                install because I'm too lazy to follow the instructions,
                so I haven't yet tried <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































                You have to install a huge number of <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span> packages
                first, but fortunately that's really easy.&nbsp; For
                now, I'll just note that you use the Linux build
                instructions, and you have to do 'make NOREADLINE=yes",
                because for some reason Jordan's command-history stuff
                doesn't build.&nbsp; Also, the stuff for shutting down
                all of the components of the simulation gracefully
                doesn't work, so comment out the line reading "SimStop"
                in scripts like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>.&nbsp;






















































































































































































































































                Finally, the steps to running the simulation are to run
                "startx" from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span>
                command line, and then to run <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">SimLuminary131</span> or another startup script
                from the X-terminal.&nbsp; I'll write up the
                instructions for this in detail as I perfect it.</li>
              <li>Building, in general:&nbsp; Now have a much better
                technique, I think, for detecting the build-platform, so
                there's more consistency among the build-instructions on
                different platforms.<br>

                at present.&nbsp; (Sections 4 and 6 are missing, but we
                have sections 1-3, 5, and 7.)&nbsp; Section 7 is
                particularly interesting, because it documents and
                contains AGC assembly listings of all programs loaded
                into AGC erasable core memory rather than fixed core
                memory.&nbsp; In other words, these are the programs

                Jordan Slott has added a few fixes to the recent --debug
                mode features.&nbsp; Because of the fixes, 'readline'
                support is now enabled by default in the

                <li>Repaired some spurious printing of prompts during

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now
                  builds when readline support is enabled, and actually
                  works in Win32.&nbsp; In other words, you can get a
                  command history.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:

                  <span style="font-style: italic;">no longer functions
                    properly</span>, regardless of whether you compile
                  with or without readline support.&nbsp; Hopefully that
                  will be fixed Real Soon Now.&nbsp; (If you need
                  --debug mode in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                  under Linux or Mac OS X, please hold off on

                Jordan has added some further frills to the --debug
                mode.&nbsp; Here are the notes on the changes:</li>
            </ul>
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>Added the "files &lt;regex&gt;" debugging command.
                This lists the source files matching the given regular
                expression.&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
              <li>Reworked the "break" command. Now "break *address" is
                used to add a breakpoint at a memory address, as in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>.&nbsp; The
                "break &lt;line&gt;" is used to break at a line number,
                whenever &lt;line&gt; can be parsed as an integer.
                Update "help break" to reflect this change.</li>
              <li>Improved the output from "breakpoints" a bit -- for
                those breakpoints specified using a symbol or a line
                number, it outputs the <span
                  class="moz-txt-link-freetext">file:line</span> from
                where it can be found. Note that I do not output <span
                  class="moz-txt-link-freetext">file:line</span> if you
                create a breakpoint using a memory address, although I
                don't think this would be difficult to do.</li>
              <li>Fixed a small bug in "list from,to" where the line
                numbers were not being displayed.</li>
              <li>Cleaned up some of my old code in symbol_table.c</li>
              <li>Added the ability to use libreadline to read in the
                debugger command line. The upshot is you get source file
                name completion, history, etc.&nbsp; (<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; Though
                apparently functional, this feature is currently
                disabled in the Makefile, because of some conflicts
                which prevent yaAGS from building.&nbsp; Hopefully it
                can be fixed up soon.)<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>Startup scripts:&nbsp; After performing some upgrades
                on my main Linux workstation, I found that the startup
                scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>,
                etc.) have become unreliable and may randomly shut down
                the simulation.&nbsp; (It's a problem in the
                relatively-recently-added feature that shutting down any
                component of the simulation, such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, shuts down
                all of the other components, such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>.)&nbsp;
                This should not affect Windows users, but potentially
                affect everyone else.&nbsp; I don't know how to fix this
                problem with any satisfying degree of certainty, but
                workarounds have been added that should reduce the
                probability of such a random shutdown to a very low
                order of probability.</li>

                has greatly improved the symbolic debugging, with the
                greatest improvement being that (where possible) the
                actual source code is displayed rather than disassembled
                source code.&nbsp; This lets you see not only program
                labels and variable names, but even program
                comments.&nbsp; Several versions of <a
                  href="yaAGC.html#LIST">the LIST command</a> have been
                implemented in the debugger, so that you can get various
                types of disassemblies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it's all
                related to the source files by filename and line number,
                so it's cross-referenced much more nicely.&nbsp; I'd say
                this feature is now at a completely satisfying stage,
                from a user's point of view.&nbsp; <span

                Slott (thanks, Jordan!) has sent in a very cool mod that

                The upshot of this is that in some cases you can use
                symbolic names when debugging, rather than being forced
                to use absolute numeric addresses all the time.&nbsp;
                It's still not fully implemented, but it's pretty
                valuable nonetheless.&nbsp; Refer to the <a
                  href="yaAGC.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                  page</a> to see how to use it.&nbsp; Symbolic
                debugging was on my wish list, but I was too lazy to do
                anything about it.&nbsp; Besides, it was very brave of
                Jordan to poke around in my source code.&nbsp;
                (Hopefully there won't be too much emotional
                scarring.)&nbsp; This builds and works on both Linux and
                Win32, but I haven't had a chance to try it in MacOS X.<br>

                that the Colossus 3 source code is also dribbling in,

                --yaw, --pitch, and --roll adjustments, or even their
                default values; for me, this only affected the Win32
                platform (with the symptom being that in ATTITUDE HOLD,
                the thrusters were continually firing to increase yaw),
                but it has been fixed for all platforms.&nbsp; The
                program has been tweaked so that its timing is much more
                convenient in Mac OS X.&nbsp; Also, if it does not find
                a joystick on start-up, it keeps trying until it finds
                one, so you can plug in the joystick after startup

              <li>MS Windows:&nbsp; A few days ago I was able to modify
                the startup scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>,
                etc.) in Linux so that:&nbsp; a) they don't open so many
                useless windows; and b) they shutdown all of the Virtual
                AGC apps and windows when you choose to exit from any
                one of them.&nbsp; This is tremendously convenient, and
                is theoretically possible in Windows XP Pro, but not
                (apparently) in Windows XP Home, or any other version of
                Windows.&nbsp; The facilities for doing process
                management simply aren't provided in Windows in a form
                usable by batch files.&nbsp; So instead, I've written a
                program (WinAGC.exe) that accomplishes the same
                thing.&nbsp; It's a program that simply runs groups of
                programs, and then shuts down all of those programs when
                any one of them shuts down.&nbsp; I've revamped all of
                the Windows batch files (SimLuminary131.bat, etc.) so
                that they take advantage of WinAGC.exe.&nbsp; This
                should work in any version of Windows, but I've only
                tried it in Windows 98 (first edition), Windows XP Home,
                and Windows XP Pro.&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The downside is that you
              can no longer use any command-line parameters with the
              batch files.&nbsp; I've tried to make intelligent choices
              as to which command-line switches you might want, but if
              I'm wrong you need to edit one or another of the files
              SimLuminary131.xeq, SimLuminary131_lite.xeq,
              SimColossus249.xeq, or SimColossus249_lite.xeq.&nbsp;
              (These ".xeq" files contain the lists of files, along with
              their command-line parameters, that are run by
              WinAGC.exe.)&nbsp; Even then, there are some things you
              can't accomplish, such as running <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> in --debug
              mode.&nbsp; If you want to do that, I'd suggest setting
              the environment variable NOWINAGC=yes before running the
              startup scripts, as this will restore the batch files to
              their pre-WinAGC glory.<br>
              <br>
              Another downside is that that <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Allegro</span> and <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> are now really requirements rather
              than options, although I've not had a chance to update the
              instructions yet.&nbsp; The reason is that the startup
              scripts will abort if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
              and <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
              cannot be run, rather than ignoring it.&nbsp; (I must say,
              though, that you really want to run both of these things,
              although admittedly <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
              isn't of much use without a "3D game controller" --- i.e.,
              a joystick.&nbsp; Therefore, buy a joystick.)&nbsp; If you
              absolutely don't want to run these programs, or cannot for
              some reason, edit the appropriate ".xeq" file and prefix
              the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> and/or
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> lines

                Some fixes have been made that can prevent the CPU

                allow automatic shutdown of the simulation when any of

                scripts continue to work as before in non-XP-Pro
                versions of Windows.&nbsp; To activate the new script
                feature, you need to set the environment variable XPPRO
                to anything non-blank.&nbsp; Since I don't have a

                <li>The simulation of the joystick is very limited jet
                  and just in an experimental status. The steering
                  commands are only recognized when they are along the
                  three axis (Roll, Pitch and Yaw). A combined steering
                  command (e.g. u or v axis) is not yet
                  implemented.&nbsp; Also, the calculation of the RCS
                  fire time is based on the setting within the "Attitude
                  &amp; Speed Control" window.&nbsp; The simulation just
                  takes the RCS thruster time and multiplies that time
                  with the joystick amplitude divided by 57.&nbsp; That
                  means that a full stick deflection takes the selected
                  time as RCS fire time.</li>

                  Moment of Inertia along all three axes is identical
                  (which is obviously not completely true for the real
                  world).&nbsp; MOI change is stable over the whole LM
                  weight range (which is comparable with real world
                  behavior).</li>
                <li>It now interoperates with <span style="font-weight:

                  attitude-hold, you can see the digital auto-pilot
                  (DAP) firing thrusters in response to displacement of
                  the rotational hand-controller (RHS).&nbsp; Of course,
                  if you don't have a 3D joystick, this will be of
                  little value to you.&nbsp; Also, the connection has
                  not yet been made between the thrust outputs of the
                  CPU and the thrust inputs of the IMU.&nbsp; In other
                  words, while the IMU can respond to thrust inputs
                  entered into it manually, it will not yet respond to
                  the thrust commands generated by the CPU.&nbsp; (By
                  the way, turning on ATTITUDE HOLD causes a program
                  alarm 32000---which is a CPU overload---but this is

                only to manage them, but also to make sure you get all
                of the individual programs closed when you want to exit
                the simulation.&nbsp; The startup scripts have now been
                modified to that in Linux, so that not only are less
                xterms open, but also closing any one of the
                applications (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>)
                will also close all of the other applications and
                windows as well.&nbsp; I only found out how to do this
                by accident, and it's awfully convenient!&nbsp; I don't
                know how to do this in Windows, but I'm sure I'll figure
                it out one of these days.&nbsp; (Of course, if anybody

                (Stephan continues to be a busy bee.)&nbsp; This is the

                words, rather than adding angular displacements around
                the pitch/yaw/roll axes, you can apply thrust around the
                pitch/yaw/roll axes.&nbsp; Once you start playing with <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">that</span>, it's hard to
                stop!)&nbsp; The calculation of the "moment of inertia"
                by using the LM mass distribution is not yet correctly
                implemented.&nbsp; The values used are just
                experimental.&nbsp; The calculation of the RCS
                propellant consumption depends on the RCS impulse length
                and should be correct within in the current simulation
                which uses 445N for each thruster and a specific impulse
                of 2840MS.&nbsp; The Attitude control uses an impulse

              <li>Stephan has sent a new version of <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>.&nbsp;
                Here are the changes:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Workarounds added when we believed the
                  fine-alignment problems were on the <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> side
                  rather than the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                  side have been removed.&nbsp; (Specifically, the
                  angle-increment value is corrected, and the coordinate
                  transformation has been deactivated.)</li>
                <li>Drives the IMU to Zero when the "Zero IMU CDU"
                  signal is activated. Now the IMU zeros after V36E (AGC
                  reset) but there are cases where the AGC lefts the
                  signal active. After using the crew button "Zero
                  IMU..." the signal goes back to zero.</li>
                <li>Drive the IMU only when "Coarse Align Enable of IMU"
                  is activated. This is really an important change,
                  because in the "Attitude Hold Mode" the AGC uses the
                  counters to drive the error needles and the autopilot
                  misalignment. If the IMU was driven in such cases,
                  then the FDAI would jump uncontrollably over a small
                  angle area.</li>
                <li>Socket Timeout added. If there is a period longer
                  than 2 seconds when no data appears on the socket,
                  then the LM Simulator assumes that the AGC has been
                  terminated. After showing an error message: "Lost
                  connection to yaAGC" the program terminates
                  itself.&nbsp; (This is a slight problem when yaAGC is
                  run in --debug mode.&nbsp; We are looking at fixes for
                  that case now.)</li>
                <li>Attitude &amp; Speed Control has been changed.&nbsp;
                  (You don't have the same precise level of control over

                Well, I was wrong, and there still were fixups that
                needed to be made in order to get fine-alignment to
                work.&nbsp; That fix is made, but there is still a

                The changes are:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>FDAI finalized (Z-Axis added)</li>
                <li>A bug fix for counting.&nbsp; [To keep the simulated
                  angles equal to those of the AGC there is a need for
                  both an external counter which stores the IMU angles
                  in high resolution and a counter which counts in angle
                  increments of (0.01Deg).&nbsp; Previously, only the
                  latter was used, leading to large angle misalignments
                  after several attitude changes. Now, there is a
                  synchronization between the counters, which enables a
                  sufficient precision in angle handling.]</li>
              </ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>:&nbsp;
                Previously, there was no use made of the GYROCMD counter
                register in gyro torquing during fine-alignment.&nbsp;
                Since the GYROCMD register is the central entity in this
                operation, that pretty much ruined it.&nbsp; The upshot
                of this fix is that IMU fine-alignment should now work
                properly.<br>

            display downlink lists so much that I've split off that
            ability from the "--test-uplink" command-line switch, and
            added it to a new "--test-downlink" command-line
            switch.&nbsp; In fact, "--test-downlink" is used by default
            in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>

            startup scripts.&nbsp; Of course, the ability to completely
            display all downlink lists isn't quite available.&nbsp;
            However, the erasable dump downlist is still available, and
            the AGS initialization/update downlist is complete.<br>

              <li>Rewrote a lot of the telemetry-downlink formatting
                code I added yesterday.&nbsp; I realized that I could
                write it in a way that was much more flexible so that

                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> or other
                apps, with mere replacement of a pointer to the function
                that does the actual output.&nbsp; In other words, the
                code is now completely reusable, and independent of the
                output device.&nbsp; Consequently, I feel much more
                enthusiastic about going ahead to do more work on it.</li>
              <li>Stephan has sent over a new version of <span

                Here's a summary of the changes, as I understand them:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>There are now Roll, Pitch and Yaw commands in the
                  attitude window, which translate into the associated
                  IMU gimbal angle changes.&nbsp; (Previously, there
                  were X, Y, Z gimbal-angle commands that simply drove
                  the gimbal angles without translation.)</li>
                <li>There is a kind FDAI ball in the IMU window now,
                  though Stephan points out that "with TCL/TK there is
                  no chance to create a <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">real</span> FDAI ball." (Even so, in my
                  humble opinion, it seems darned good.)</li>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">
            <ul>
              <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s
                "--test-uplink" mode, I now print out a little of the
                downlink lists in more human-friendly form, but there's
                just <span style="font-style: italic;">so much</span>
                data that the effort of making it human-friendly---i.e.,
                printing it with descriptive headings and units, and
                scaled properly---is enormous.&nbsp; There are a couple
                of thousand data values in the complete collection of
                downlink lists (though, admittedly, with some overlap
                among the lists).&nbsp; I don't think I'll do much more
                of it right now.&nbsp; I have, however, organized the
                hooks for doing it into libyaAGC, so the effort isn't
                entirely wasted, and is potentially reusable by anyone
                who wants to complete the work.&nbsp; I'd be more
                excited about doing it myself, if I knew what the
                displays on the downlink-telemetry consoles in
                mission-control were supposed to look like.<br>
              </li>
              <li>I have added a couple of new commands (LMSIM and
                CMSIM) to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>/<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> INI
                files.&nbsp; These commands tell the simulation whether
                it is supposed to be for an LM or a CM.&nbsp; (Odd that
                this hasn't been needed until now, isn't it?)&nbsp; The
                downlink lists for the LM and CM aren't distinguishable
                in some cases without this additional info.&nbsp; (They
                would have been distinguishable in real life, because
                the telemetry downlink hardware external to the CPU
                would have added this identfying info, I think.)<br>

                The digital uplink has now been implemented.&nbsp; I had
                to modify the description of it that I added to the
                developer page a few days ago, but not by much.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>:&nbsp;
                I've added a new command-line switch,
                "--test-uplink".&nbsp; In this mode, <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> emits
                uplink-data when keys are pressed instead of emitting
                keycodes to its usual CPU input channel 015.&nbsp; This
                mode is very convenient for testing the digital uplink,
                since the uplink data consists of encoded DSKY keycodes
                anyhow.&nbsp; I've noticed that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> is very lazy
                in updating the DSKY display when receiving uplink data;
                indeed, it may or may not update the display.&nbsp;
                However, in the absence of other data, I assume this is
                a normal property of the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Luminary</span> and <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Colossus</span> flight software, rather than a
                bug in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































                This mode also prints messages when valid downlink data
                is detected, so I think it's fair to say that both the
                digital uplink and digital downlink are working properly
                now.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































                If you want to see something keen you can do with this,
                look at section 2.1.2 on p. 2-8 of the <a

                Enter V71E on the DSKY (in --test-uplink mode), and
                proceed from there.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>:&nbsp; I
                now properly handle the DOWNRUPT interrupt
                request.&nbsp; The practical upshot of this is that the
                CPU is now emitting downlink telemetry and/or AEA
                initialization packets, whereas it was not doing so
                before.&nbsp; You can see the downlink in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>, but
                it's just raw data on i/o channels 034 and 035, and so
                isn't very informative as of yet.<br>
              </li>
              <li>I rationalized the startup scripts somewhat.&nbsp; In
                particular, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                script is created during installation, and the other
                scripts (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>)
                call that script.&nbsp; This shouldn't matter much to
                anybody but me, I guess, but it allows <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s --debug
                switch to be used again with the scripts.&nbsp; Scripts
                like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>
                can have up to three command-line arguments, the first
                of which is passed (in common) to <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, the second
                one of which is passed to <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span>, and the third one of which is
                passed to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































                Scripts like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131-lite</span>
                have a single optional command-line argument, which is
                passed directly to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































                The table below is probably a complete list of the <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">useful</span> ways you can
                use the command-line options with the scripts.&nbsp;
                (Though not shown, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span>[<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">-lite</span>] scripts work
                the same way, but obviously without <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> and the
                DEDA.)&nbsp; If you want to do something trickier, you
                should probably run the various programs directly rather
                than relying on the startup scripts.<br>

            occur that I can't figure out any way to stop, but it

            for continuing development of the IMU --- in this case, of
            IMU coarse alignment.&nbsp; Modified the description on the
            developer page of the description of channel 14 needed to
            use this feature, as well as the description of the CDUxCMD
            registers in the assembly-language manual page.&nbsp;

            Webb.&nbsp; (Thanks, Julian!)&nbsp; I'm bound to say that
            there are a number of things that don't make sense about it
            to me, but it does manage to pass the self-test (which no
            algorithm I invented was able to do).&nbsp; Anyone who feels
            competent to do so is invited to examine the <span

            the function <span style="font-family: monospace;">aea_engine</span>
            of the source file aea_engine.c, and give me your insights

            built-in self-test (see, for example, p. 115 of Flight
            Program 8), and may therefore be cautiously considered as
            working.&nbsp; Probably there are plenty of problems with it
            that will surface slowly in the coming months.<br>

            <ul>
              <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>,
                implemented a fictitious output channel 0177 (see the <a
                  href="developer.html#Table_of_IO_Channels">developer
                  page</a>) which can be used for simplifying
                implementation of emulated gyros.</li>
              <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>,
                added the DISASSEMBLE, COUNTS, and PATTERN commands for
                debug-mode.&nbsp; Fixed the <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">TIX</span> instruction, which was
                overwriting memory and causing the problem mentioned two
                days ago.&nbsp; But now I find that there is a
                fundamental problem in the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGS</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>
                interaction through the socket interface; <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> only
                transmits data to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                upon a strobe from <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>,
                but there is not enough time between the strobe and the
                time the flight program checks the shift register for
                the data to be exchanged.&nbsp; Resolving this will take
                some thought.<br>
              </li>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-style:

              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>Unknown unprogrammed sequences as output of the
                  AGC/AGS are now handled (hopefully ;-))</li>
                <li>Improvement of the DSKY Lite by using real 7-Segment
                  numbers</li>
                <li>Remove of a trace (inserted for development) of an
                  internal timer which would fill up the Log-Out-Window</li>
                <li>Crew Button handling (AOT, Descent) corrected</li>
                <li>DSKY PRO button is now working</li>
                <li>Time printouts removed</li>
                <li>DSKY Labeling and Number Size as well as separation
                  lines corrected and added.</li>
                <li>Most important, the program now merely recognizes
                  AGC data packages with the following signature: 00...
                  01... 10... 11... So, the AGS packets shouldn't have a

                Here's what he has to say about it:<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-style:
                italic;">Bug Fixes:</span><br style="font-style:
                italic;">
              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>AGC Output has been completely revised. Now I'm
                  using text labels which will show the different state
                  of the signals.</li>
                <li>LM System Signals and Crew Buttons corrected. I'm
                  still unsure in some cases.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-style: italic;">New Features:</span><br
                style="font-style: italic;">
              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>DSKY LITE is a very simple (awful graphics) but full
                  functioning DSKY. Due to your extensive description of
                  the interface it was quite simple to implement.</li>
                <li>IMU Simulation has been corrected and accelerated.
                  The angles are now running between 0\B0 and 360\B0 as
                  noted by the AGC.</li>
                <li>Simple RHC and THC as well as AOT buttons added</li>
                <li>Noun &amp; Verbs and first steps of the Tutorial
                  added.</li>
              </ul>
              The "DSKY LITE" is, I think, remarkably good, in spite of
              Stephan's badmouthing of the graphics.<br>

                discretes" on the developer page, in the <span

                set.&nbsp; Shouldn't be too much longer before it's

              <li>On the <a href="links.html">links page</a>, updated

                Orbiter simulator.&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp; It's going great,
                and there is now a Sourceforge project for it, again
                thanks to Markus Joachim.)</li>
              <li>There's now a skeleton of a <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGS</span> program.&nbsp; It doesn't do much
                yet other than to allow <span style="font-weight:

                selected flight program, and keep accurate time, and
                execute a few types of instructions.&nbsp; Lots of
                instructions are implemented, but they're all of a
                rather simple nature.&nbsp; (But who knows if they're
                implemented <span style="font-style: italic;">correctly</span>?&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































                I haven't quite figured out yet how I'll be testing

              <li>Stephan Hotto's <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                program is now included in the installation when doing
                'make install' (i.e., building from source).&nbsp; The <span

                You need to have Tcl/Tk installed to take advantage of
                this, but if you don't nothing bad will happen.&nbsp;
                Incidentally, Stephan has given me a list of a few
                problems he's found so far.&nbsp; I won't bother to put
                these in the buglist quite yet; the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> program
                is so new that it's in rapid flux.&nbsp; After it has
                settled down some, then I'll start recording bugs for
                it.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; This big
            bunch of changes isn't without cost.&nbsp; This stuff likely
            won't build (or won't build completely) on Windows and Mac
            OS X.&nbsp; I'll fix this up soon, but probably not until
            I'm happy with <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>.&nbsp;





















































































































































































































































            Therefore, Windows and Mac OS X users will probably want to
            stick with the binary packages, use an earlier source
            package, or else just take your chances.<br>

                doesn't exist yet, but because the DEDA is smarter than

                Has been cleaned up a lot, and has a lot more
                options.&nbsp; After experimentation, it now has a lot
                more realistic default timestep for the numerical
                integration (6 hours rather than 1 minute).&nbsp;
                Consequently, we can get realistic ephemeris data with a
                1-hour rather than a 1-minute timestep, and can
                therefore tremendously reduce the ephemeris data in
                size.&nbsp; For testing purposes, the Apollo8-epoch

                zipfiles, but it seems to be fixed now.&nbsp; It
                affected only the 20040905 and 20040910 files.&nbsp; The
                20040912 zipfile should be okay, and contains exactly
                the same stuff that the 20040905 file was <span

                Mr. Paul Fjeld has informed me that the digits in the
                DSKY simulation haven't been quite right.&nbsp; (In his
                words:&nbsp; "The digits on the [real] DSKY were unique
                and very cool.")&nbsp; Since Mr. Fjeld is both an artist
                and the Spacecraft Manager for LM-13 at the <a
                  href="http://www.cradleofaviation.org/exhibits/restorations/lem.html">
                  Cradle of Aviation Museum</a>, I'm inclined to believe
                him.&nbsp; Besides, he prepared an all-new set of images
                of the digits and sent them to me, thus saving me most
                of the work in changing them.&nbsp; So obviously, the
                appearances of the decimal digits have now changed in
                the software, and indeed, have changed pretty
                dramatically.&nbsp; (For now, though, I'll let all of
                the <span style="font-style: italic;">screenshots</span>
                on this website stay the way they are, so they're all a

              <li>Developer changes (normal functionality not
                affected):&nbsp; My original intention was that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> would be
                developed in a way that was very independent of the
                peripheral devices (like the IMU and DSKY), and somewhat
                independent as well from the means of interfacing to the
                peripherals.&nbsp; Unfortunately, over time this idea
                became corrupted to the point that it really became
                impossible for developers to use anything other than the
                default socket-based interface (which I still
                recommend!), unless the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span> source code itself was hacked
                quite a lot.&nbsp; This has become unacceptable, since
                there are a number of groups adapting <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> to existing
                flight simulators, or other purposes, and all of this
                independent hacking will make it time-consuming to port
                improvements to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                into all of these efforts.&nbsp; Therefore:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>I have&nbsp; separated all socket-based code from
                  the offending source-code file (agc_engine.c), and
                  replaced it instead by a simple 3-function API that
                  should be usable for developing memory-mapped i/o
                  models, embedded AGC's, or other purposes, <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">without further
                    modification to agc_engine.c</span>.&nbsp;<br>
                </li>
                <li>I have created an embedded demonstration (i.e., of
                  an AGC as embedded firmware) based on a Motorola
                  Coldfire microcontroller, using an unmodified
                  agc_engine.c.<br>
                </li>
                <li>These concepts will be explained in detail on the <a

                  next week or so, though no details are available there

                (And speaking of improvements that need to be
                back-ported ...)&nbsp; I have noticed that although I
                provided all of the hooks for processing external
                triggers for counters (such as gimbal CDU counters), I
                did not actually implement them.&nbsp; In other words,
                if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                received a signal to increment a counter register, it
                would not actually do so.&nbsp; Hopefully this has been
                fixed.</li>

                since no other versions have turned up.&nbsp; However,
                Mr. Paul Fjeld has told me of the existence of 3
                additional AGC software versions, including (apparently)
                both the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
                versions used for Apollo 11.&nbsp; While I don't <span

                /usr/local/bin) to c:/mingw/bin.&nbsp; This should let
                command-line switches like --core and --cfg work

                The default <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
                graphical interface is far too big for any graphics
                resolution less than 1024×768.&nbsp; I've therefore now
                added another mode to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>,
                in which interface is only half as big.&nbsp; Use <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s --half-size
                command-line switch to get the smaller interface.&nbsp;
                The smaller interface doesn't really look very good,
                because it is simply blindly scaled down from the larger
                interface, rather than being optimized, but at least
                it's usable at 800×600 and 640×480 resolutions.</li>

                  anyway, so I've now fixed it that the HELP-text is
                  topic-specific (resulting in much shorter messages).</li>

                The timing for polling has been changed, in order to
                reduce the PC's CPU utilization.&nbsp; Also, backtrace
                references (as originally intended) are no longer
                created when not in --debug mode.&nbsp; (In Linux on my
                2.8GHz P4, the net effect of these changes is to reduce
                the CPU utilization from 90-98% to an immeasurably small
                percentage whilst waiting for --debug mode keystrokes,
                and to 0-2% whilst running the simulator.&nbsp; In

                tweaks from working with <span style="font-weight:

                assembled with the wrong value now.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sounds
                bad, but a couple of days ago there were over 15,000
                fatal errors, and the core-rope --- if I had bothered to
                create it --- would have been 100% wrong.&nbsp;

            with this and from discussions with Julian Webb, it seems
            probable that at least the L register (and possibly all
            erasable memory) will have to be made 16-bits.&nbsp; This
            means that instructions like "<span style="font-family:
              monospace;">CA L</span>" and "<span style="font-family:
              monospace;">CS L</span>" don't presently work properly
            when overflow is involved.<br>
            <br>
            ... Or else, it means that the description of control-pulses
            in Blair-Smith is not entirely accurate.&nbsp; It
            contradicts some later docs (like Smally), so this is
            possible.&nbsp; Must think more deeply ....<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">Various issues related to the
            virtual i/o channels were fixed:&nbsp; <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s handling of i/o
            channels was incorrect, in that it internally used the wrong
            numeric format for them, so none of them worked properly;
            moreover, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            read the virtual input port, it never actually wrote to the
            virtual output port (except in --debug-dsky mode).&nbsp; As
            a separate issue, both <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s






























































            and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s
            handling of the PRO key was wrong, in that the wrong bitflag
            was used for it.&nbsp; It looks like i/o channels are now
            handled correctly, not only in normal mode, but in --debug
            mode and in --debug-dsky mode.&nbsp; In experimenting with
            this, I noticed that it is impossible in --debug mode to
            ever find the PRO key pressed by checking "edit c32",
            because the PRO key sets this bit when the <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> key is pressed,
            and then clears the bit when released.&nbsp; Therefore,
            using "edit c32" will always find the bitflag associated
            with PRO cleared.&nbsp; But you can see that it works if you
            debug <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> itself
            with <span style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>.<br>

            the --debug mode of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            easier:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>The disassembler now shows opcodes for the
                implied-address instructions, like "<span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">SQUARE</span>" instead
                of "<span style="font-family: monospace;">MP A</span>"
                and "<span style="font-family: monospace;">RETURN</span>"
                instead of "<span style="font-family: monospace;">TC Q</span>".</li>
              <li>When <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
                is used with an instruction, the disassembler decodes
                and shows the instruction with the index added (along
                with a notation "w/i"), instead of leaving the user to
                deduce it.</li>
              <li>The timing used (i.e., the number of machine cycles in
                a given period of real-time) was messed up when --debug
                mode was used, since the time spent waiting at the
                debugger prompt was not accounted for.</li>
              <li>The timing also was not previously right with the
                --resume switch, since the time used prior to generating
                the core-dump wasn't accounted for.</li>
              <li>The construct <span style="font-family: monospace;">sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</span>
                is now used in place of <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">CLK_TCK</span>.&nbsp; This is required for
                new compiler versions.&nbsp; I don't know if it will
                break under older compilers or not.&nbsp; I <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">think</span> I've fixed it

            *.ini, Luminary131.bin, and Colossus249.bin to the
            installation directory (which is hard-coded as
            /usr/local/bin, so it's not totally perfect).&nbsp;
            Meanwhile, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> will now
            look in the installation directory for files specified with
            the --cfg and --core switches, if not found in the current
            directory.&nbsp; (These suggestions are due to Christian
            Bucher.)&nbsp; Also, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            had not been displaying error messages when the file for
            --cfg wasn't found, and this has been corrected.&nbsp; The
            instruction "DXCH L", which is not unambiguously defined by
            the docs, has changed in a way that conforms to comments in
            the Luminary131 source.&nbsp; (Refer to address 33,03514, p.
            888.)&nbsp; Fixed a potential divide-by-0 in the DV
            instruction, but my impression is that my DV instruction
            right now is completely wrong anyhow.<br>
