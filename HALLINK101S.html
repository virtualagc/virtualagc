    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
    <b>HALLINK101S</b> is our "modern" version of the link editor used
    to combine IBM AP-101 object files created by the HAL/S language
    compiler and AP-101S assembler into "load files" which can be
    directly executed on an IBM AP-101 computer or emulator
    thereof.&nbsp; To the best of my knowledge, the original linker
    actually used for Shuttle software development has not survived, so
    <b>HALLINK101S</b> is an entirely-new creation.&nbsp; It is a Python
    3 program that should work on any computer having the Python 3
    language installed. <br>
    <br>
    Regarding the IBM AP-101B vs AP-101S computers, the AP-101B was used
    in earlier Shuttle flights, while the AP-101S was used in later
    flights.&nbsp; <b>HALLINK101S</b> is completely agnostic on the
    question of AP-101B vs AP-101S.<br>
    <p>I am not aware of surviving documentation describing the format
      of AP-101S object files specifically, nor of any surviving AP-101
      object-code files from the Shuttle era.&nbsp; In any case, I think
      that such object code would have been produced not as "files" in a
      mass-storage system, but rather as decks of computer punch-cards
      punched directly by the original HAL/S compiler (HAL/S-FC) or
      AP-101 assembler.&nbsp; So it is possible that the decks of punch
      cards could still exist, hidden away somewhere, even if not as
      online files.&nbsp; In any case, I have no access to them, and
      have heard nary a hint of their existence, and I could be mistaken
      in my inferences about them anyway.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The original linker is referred to in the contemporary
      documentation simply as "the AP-101 link editor", and the
      contemporary documentation goes on to say that "until the final
      version of the linkage editor is available to support all features
      of the HAL/S-FC compiler, an interim program, known as HALLINK-FC,
      will be supplied to perform the link edit functions".&nbsp; As
      usual, satisfactory documentation for neither "the AP-101 link
      editor" nor for <b>HALLINK-FC</b> (nor for its System/360-target
      predecessor <b>HALLINK</b>) is available to us.&nbsp; Indeed, I
      do not even know if the "the AP-101 link editor" was ever
      completed satisfactorily to supersede <b>HALLINK-FC</b>. My
      intuition, based on nothing concrete, is that it was not, and that
      <b>HALLINK-FC</b> was used until the end of the Shuttle
      project.&nbsp; But since we have access to neither of those
      linkers, any intuition of mine about them is without value.<br>
    </p>
    On the other hand, we <i>do</i> have a modern port (from the XPL
    programming language into the Python programming language) of the
    original HAL/S compiler.&nbsp; That being the case, we can use the
    compiler to convert HAL/S source code into AP-101S object files, and
    in principle we might be able to do whatever reverse engineering is
    required on those object files to clarify issues regarding the
    object-file format.&nbsp; In attempting that kind of reverse
    engineering, it quickly becomes apparent that the AP-101S
    object-file format is based upon the format of early object files
    for the IBM System/360, if not strictly identical to it.&nbsp; In
    other words, we can use the early System/360 format as our guide,
    and occasionally depart from it as needed on an <i>ad hoc</i>
    basis.&nbsp; Some relevant references are listed in the next
    section.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; It appears to me
        that in IBM parlance, what I call an "object file" would be a
        referred to as an "object <i>deck</i>", presumably because it
        was originally directly punched onto a stack of computer
        punch-cards.&nbsp; I'm not telling you this just to be pedantic
        — though obviously, that's a thing I do — but rather to let you
        know that if you google it yourself, you're likely to have much
        better luck searching for "decks" instead of "files".<br>
      </font></blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <p>As usual, not all of the System/360 features are needed for
      actual legacy AP-101S software, so only those features of the
      object-file format relevant to that surviving software are likely
      to be implemented in <b>HALLINK101S</b>; contrariwise, some <i>non</i>-System/360

      AP-101S-specific features may appear in the object files.&nbsp;
      For example, "records" in an object file are described as being of
      6 types, known as ESD, TXT, RLD, SYM, XSD, and END, but the XSD
      type wasn't introduced until the 1990's in order to deal with the
      needs of C compilers, and hence XSD records don't appear at all in
      HAL/S or AP-101S object files.&nbsp; But I won't trouble myself or
      bore you with an exhaustive list of such differences here.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    To facilitate whatever reverse engineering is needed, I've provided
    a Python 3 program that can parse the object files produced by the
    HAL/S compiler (or by <b>ASM101S</b>) and report on all of the data
    found within them.&nbsp; This will be covered in more detail later.<br>
    <h1><a name="bfs"></a>Backup vs Primary Flight Software (BFS vs PFS)</h1>
    <blockquote> </blockquote>
    <p>Let's get a clarification to my comments above out of the way.</p>
    <p>Recall that Space Shuttle flight software came in two distinct
      flavors, namely the <i>Primary Flight Software</i> (referred to
      as PFS, or loosely but more commonly as PASS) and the <i>Backup
        Flight Software</i> (BFS).&nbsp; PFS and BFS were developed
      mostly independently of each other, but more than that, their
      development tools differed as well.&nbsp; For example, although
      PFS and BFS <i>nominally</i> were compiled using the same HAL/S
      compiler (HAL/S-FC), in fact there were two incompatible versions
      of HAL/S-FC (for PFS) and HAL/S-BFC (for BFS). &nbsp; And the fact
      that there are two separate compilers doesn't affect just PFS and
      BFS code, but <i>any</i> HAL/S program we may write:&nbsp; We
      always have a choice of which of the two flavors of the compiler
      to use!<br>
    </p>
    <p>More importantly for us in the context of the present discussion,
      PFS and BFS used different linker programs.&nbsp; Outside of this
      one section you're reading now, both this entire page and
      specifically the <b>HALLINK101S</b> linker program described on
      this page are for object code generated by the PASS/PFS flavor the
      HAL/S compiler.&nbsp; Object code generated by the BFS version of
      the compiler won't even be mentioned outside of this one section
      you're reading right now ... well, with one brief return when <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="#reverse">reverse engineering</a>
      is discussed later.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Why?&nbsp; Well, back in the day, rather than using the AP-101
      link editor, BFS was linked using a different program called <b>PILOT</b>
      (Program Integration and Loading Tool).&nbsp; Furthermore, while
      object code produced by the PFS version of HAL/S-FC was in a
      modified System/360 format, object code produced by HAL/S-BFC was
      instead in <b>PILOT</b> format.&nbsp; The two object-code formats
      are completely incompatible.&nbsp; In other words, neither the
      AP-101 link editor nor its intended replacement <b>HALLINK101S</b>
      are compatible with <b>PILOT</b> object files.<br>
    </p>
    <p>That said, I hope that someday there will be a modern version of
      <b>PILOT</b> that can be used to link BFS-style object code ...
      perhaps it can be called <b>yaPILOT</b>?&nbsp; Maybe?&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>,
      that has a nice ring to it!<br>
    </p>
    <p>One hurdle is that as far as I know, there is no surviving
      information whatsoever <i>about</i> <b>PILOT</b>, and in
      particular we have no documentary information about its
      object-file format.&nbsp; To be frank, I'm proud of myself for
      even figuring out that it was <i>called</i> <b>PILOT</b> to
      begin with.&nbsp;
      The acronym "PILOT" is, of course, quite unfortunate from the
      point of view of trying to find available information via a search
      engine like Google, since all you'll discover is information about
      how to pilot a Space Shuttle.&nbsp; I'm afraid this reveals a
      certain weakness in today's treatment of knowledge, in that we
      don't have many knowledgeable people any longer, but rather we
      have people with borrowed knowledge attained via search
      engines.&nbsp; And A.I., of course, for those of us who can't use
      search engines very effectively.&nbsp; But what about when the
      search engines fail because the search terms are too common?&nbsp;
      Well, that's a good way to lose knowledge, even if it's sitting in
      plain view.&nbsp; But I doubt it would have helped if <b>PILOT</b>
      had a less-common name or if we had more native experts on <b>PILOT</b>
      to consult, since I doubt that there's any surviving information
      about <b>PILOT</b> online anyway.&nbsp; If you have any such
      documentation, send it to me!&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>But don't lose all hope.&nbsp; Since the object-code generator in
      <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaShuttle/Source%20Code/PASS.REL32V0/PASS2.PROCS">PASS2
        of the HAL/S-BFC source code</a> can produce <b>PILOT</b>-compatible
      output, it's still possible to attain <i>some</i> understanding
      of the <b>PILOT</b> format via reverse engineering it, and indeed
      perhaps a sufficient amount to implement a linker!&nbsp; I have
      done at least some of the reverse engineering, and have embedded
      my findings in a program I call <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaShuttle/Source%20Code/PASS.REL32V0/coPILOT.py">coPILOT.py</a>.&nbsp;
      Catchy, eh?&nbsp; This script can read object files created by the
      HAL/S-BFC, and parse them into a human readable form.&nbsp;
      Moreover, there's additional commentary embedded within
      coPILOT.py's source code to document some aspects of the format
      that aren't evident in the reports it outputs.&nbsp; If you want
      to read more about coPILOT.py, I'd suggest referring to <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1273#issuecomment-3897924815">the
        discussion in issue #1273 in our Virtual AGC GitHub repository</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>And now we leave the topic of BFS in order to resume our
      discussion of PASS/PFS-style object code and its linker. </p>

    To facilitate reverse engineering of the AP-101 object-file format,

    be used as a stand-alone program, to parse the object files produced
    by the HAL/S compiler (or by <b>ASM101S</b>).&nbsp; For example,
    consider <a moz-do-not-send="true"

    Of course, the documentation needs to be consulted even to
    understand the parsed information in the report in any detail.&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, even on a superficial reading, this report tells us
    that the object file contains 11 "records", of type SYM (3), ESD
    (2), TXT (4), RLD (1), and END (1), and reveals how various features
    easily visible in the HAL/S source code are represented in the
    object file.&nbsp; You may notice that the report doesn't really
    provide much information about <i>individual</i> SYM (symbol-table)
    records.&nbsp; That's because all SYM records need to be conjoined
    end-to-end, and it is only the conjoined record that contains
    parsable information; whereas the individual SYM records are not
    separately parsable.&nbsp; Parsing the conjoined record is where the
    "SYM-Record Summary" at the end of the report comes from.<br>
    <br>
    In the reverse-engineering report we see items obviously related in
    a general way to the HAL/S source code, though the relationship is
    not immediately clear in detail, such as the symbols <code>#CSTATIS</code>,
    <code>#ZSTATIS</code>, <code>#DSTATIS</code>, <code>#QEMIN</code>,
    <code>#QEMAX</code>, and <code>#QESUM</code>.&nbsp; Some of the
    details are filled in by <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="Shuttle/Courses/Basic%20HAL-S%20Programming%20Course/CourseSlides.pdf#page=481">the



      "Basic HAL/S Programming" course's section "HAL/S CSECTS"</a>.&nbsp;



    That course explains that each HAL/S "compilation unit" is
    automatically assigned a 6-character "generic name" by removing all
    underscores and truncating to 6 characters.&nbsp; (It's up to the
    programmer to insure that all of the generic names are
    unique!)&nbsp; Since in the example we're using the block being
    compiled is named <code>STATISTICS</code>, the generic name is just
    "STATIS".&nbsp; The compiler then generates names for the various
    control sections it likes to create by prefixing various 2-character
    strings to the generic name.&nbsp; You can see the hopefully-full
    list of prefixes at the hyperlink just given, but the ones relevant
    to our particular example are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><code>#C</code> — <code>COMSUB</code> code block, hence <code>#CSTATIS</code><font
          size="-1">&nbsp; </font></li>
      <li><code>#D</code> — <code>PROGRAM</code> or <code>COMSUB</code>
        data, hence <code>#DSTATIS</code></li>
      <li><code>#Z</code> — <code>ZCON CSECT</code> for <code>COMSUB</code>
        or <code>REMOTE</code> data, hence <code>#ZSTATIS</code></li>
      <li><code>#Q</code><code></code> — <code>ZCON</code> for library
        routines, hence <code>#QEMIN</code>, <code>#QEMAX</code>, and
        <code>#QESUM</code><code></code></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; A <code>COMSUB</code>
        is a HAL/S compilation unit containing data or code (such our <code>STATISTICS



          PROCEDURE</code>) accessible by other compilation units.&nbsp;
        <code>ZCON</code> code and <code>REMOTE</code> data are "far
        away" in the AP-101S address space from the code accessing them,
        and hence are accessed by different AP-101S instruction types
        from "nearby" data or code. The functions <code>EMIN</code>, <code>EMAX</code>,
        and <code>ESUM</code> are AP-101S assembly-language functions
        from <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaShuttle/Source%20Code/PASS.REL32V0/RUNASM">the



          HAL/S runtime library</a>.</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Alas, the object file is also seen to have a number of items not
      directly observable in the original HAL/S code but rather
      presumably transparently generated by the HAL/S compiler itself;
      examples are the symbols <code>STACK</code>, <code>STACKEND</code>,
      <code>HALS/FC</code>, <code>HALS/END</code>, <code>D24324</code>,
      and so on. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Some of these items (symbols <code>STACK</code>, <code>STACKEND</code>)
      appear in the assembly-language source code for HAL/S
      runtime-library files like <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaShuttle/Source%20Code/PASS.REL32V0/RUNASM/ACOS.asm">ACOS</a>,
      and thus apparently relate to common features HAL/S uses
      internally.&nbsp; Specifically, I believe the report may be
      telling us that the <code>DSECT</code> called <code>STACK</code>
      is 0x30 (<code>STACKEND</code>) halfwords in length.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b> Recall that because of the nature
          of the HAL/S language, the HAL/S compiler can determine at
          compile time the maximum stack required by any compilation
          unit, although the assembler cannot do so for
          assembly-language&nbsp; files.</font><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    Some other non-obvious symbols (<code>D24324</code>, <code>T4041882</code>)
    seem by my reckoning to relate to embedded datestamps and
    timestamps:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><code>D<i>YY</i><i>DDD</i></code> — the leading literal "<code>D</code>"
        presumably stands for "Date of compilation", while "<i><code>YY</code></i>"
        is the final 2 digits of the year, and "<i><code>DDD</code></i>"
        is the day of the year (1 through 365, or 366 for leap years).</li>
      <li><code>T<i>NNNNNNN</i></code> — the leading literal "<code>T</code>"
        presumably stands for "Time of compilation", while "<i><code>NNNNNNN</code></i>"
        is the number of centiseconds since midnight (0 to
        8640000).&nbsp; It's TBD as to whether this number is
        left-padded to 7 digits.&nbsp; (It's always 7 digits after 3
        a.m., but I'm too lazy to get up between midnight and 3 a.m.
        just to check the padding.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Still other symbols (such as <code>HALS/FC</code> and <code>HALS/END</code>)
    remain to be interpreted.&nbsp; Of course, I can <i>invent</i>
    explanations for anything: <i>Perhaps</i> the presence of symbol
    HALS/FC is simply the compiler's way of telling us that the
    compilation was performed by the <b>HAL/S-FC</b> compiler (as
    opposed to the <b>HAL/S-360</b> compiler).&nbsp; But then, perhaps
    not.&nbsp; Really, I haven't a clue!&nbsp; If we're lucky, time will
    tell.&nbsp; I suppose that if reverse engineering obsolete
    object-file formats were easy, those formats would be included as
    free bonus items in boxes of breakfast cereal.<br>
    <br>
    See the source code for readObject101S.py for further documentation,
    if any.<br>
    <blockquote><b><font size="-1">Aside:</font></b><font size="-1">&nbsp;
        Earlier when I mentioned <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#bfs">the
          topic of reverse engineering the <b>PILOT</b> format used for
          BFS object files</a>, and in particular the possible
        assistance offered by the tool coPILOT.py, I threatened to
        briefly return to the topic of BFS later on.&nbsp; It's now
        later!&nbsp; You may find the comparison of the BFS object code
        to the PFS object code interesting. When 140-STATISTICS is
        compiled by the BFS compiler rather than the PFS compiler, <i>two</i>
        object files are produced:&nbsp; cards/#CSTATIS and
        cards/#ZSTATIS.&nbsp; The assembly language produced is also
        slightly different, but only in that an extra instruction "<code>SVC
          0()</code>" is inserted at the very end, so I won't bore you
        with yet another printout of the generated assembly
        language.&nbsp; The following is how coPILOT.py parses the two
        object files.&nbsp; I don't think that a symbol table for local
        symbols is included in the object files, even when the
        compiler's <code>VARSYM</code> option is selected.&nbsp;
        Another thing to note is that coPILOT.py reports all addresses
        and sizes or lengths using <i>halfword</i> addressing, whereas
        readObject101S.py does so by <i>byte</i> addressing.&nbsp; Thus
        addresses and sizes or lengths reported by coPILOT.py are
        roughly half of the corresponding ones reported by
        readObject101S.py.&nbsp; Oh well, a different day (or year!), a
        different design choice!&nbsp; And there are some obvious bugs
        due to coPILOT.py being a work in progress, so please ignore
        them if you can.<br>

    <h1><a name="unexpected"></a>Unexpected Hurdles</h1>
    <p>Here are some things I find that differ between AP-101 object
      files and System/360 object files, or at least which are
      unexpected from reading the System/360 documentation.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="partial"></a>Partial Linking By the Assembler Itself</h2>
    <p>The expected:&nbsp; In System/360 assembly language, code and
      data are partitioned into a series of named "control sections",
      generically referred to as CSECTs.&nbsp; It should be the case
      that from the assembler's point of view, "addresses" begin at 0
      and increment upward in each section, and that the linker program
      subsequently reassigns different starting addresses to the
      sections generated by the assembler, while adjusting all of the
      addresses referenced within the various sections accordingly.<br>
    </p>
    The unexpected:&nbsp; However, it is clear from the surviving legacy
    AP-101S assembly listings that there are departures from these
    principles.&nbsp; Consider the following excerpt of the legacy
    assembly listing for the SQRT function of the HAL/S-FC runtime
    library:<br>

    <p>As I've highlighted in <font color="#ff0000">red</font>, there
      are two CSECTs in this excerpt, and they are called "<font
        color="#ff0000"><code>SQRT</code></font>" and "<font
        color="#ff0000"><code>#LSQRT</code></font>".&nbsp; (The <code><font
          color="#ff0000">#LSQRT</font></code> section has two separate
      <code><font color="#663300">CSECT</font></code> statements, but
      don't be distracted by that, as it's not significant in respect to
      the points I want to make.&nbsp; Also, don't be distracted by the
      lines I've highlighted in <font color="#009900">green</font>,
      which I'll discuss in a moment.)<br>
    </p>
    <p><i>Unlike</i> the expectation we (or at least I) would have, The
      <font color="#ff0000"><code>#LSQRT</code></font> section's
      addresses do <i>not</i> restart at 0, and instead the assembler
      continues to assign it addresses which continue incremented from
      the end of the <code><font color="#ff0000">SQRT</font></code>
      section.&nbsp; It is as if the assembler has already performed the
      step of partially linking these two sections of the code.&nbsp;
      Why is this?<br>
    </p>
    <p>One might argue that while whoever coded the original assembler
      thought (for some unknown reason) that it was a good idea to
      present the assembly report in this fashion, it really doesn't
      make any difference:&nbsp; As long as the object file produced by
      the assembler still represents these as independent sections, the
      linker can still reassign the addresses however it likes, with the
      result that after the final linking it may no longer be the case
      that the <font color="#ff0000"><code>#LSQRT</code></font> section
      immediately follows the <code><font color="#ff0000">SQRT</font></code>
      section in memory.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Alas, that rationalization is incorrect.&nbsp; Consider now the
      lines highlighted in <font color="#009900">green</font>, and in
      particular this instruction:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><font color="#009900">LA	R1,A</font><br></pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For the assembler to assemble an instruction like this, in which
      a "base register" is not explicitly stated as an operand itself,
      it needs to somehow determine for itself the appropriate base
      register.&nbsp; There are only two ways this can happen:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the operand (<font color="#009900"><code>A</code></font> in
        this case) is in that same code section as the instruction
        itself, in which case the appropriate base register is general
        register 3.</li>
      <li>Or else the operand is in an address block which has been made
        known the assembler via a previous <font color="#663300"><code>USING</code></font>
        pseudo-op.&nbsp; The <font color="#663300"><code>USING</code></font>
        pseudo-op informs the assembler as to what assumption it can
        make about the contents of the various general registers.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example, though, neither of these conditions
      obtains.&nbsp; As for condition #1, the instruction appears in the
      <code><font color="#ff0000">SQRT</font></code> code section, but
      its operand (<font color="#009900"><code>A</code></font>) appears
      in a different section, namely <font color="#ff0000"><code>#LSQRT</code></font>.&nbsp;




      As for condition #2, the only <font color="#663300"><code>USING</code></font>
      pseudo-op follows the instruction rather than precedes it, so
      there is no way for the assembler to make any assumptions about
      register contents.<br>
    </p>
    <p>How, then, has the assembler been able to assemble this <font
        color="#009900"><code>LA</code></font> instruction?&nbsp; Well,
      perhaps there are possibilities that haven't occurred to me, but
      it appears to me that there's only one explanation:&nbsp; The
      assembler really has already linked the <code><font
          color="#ff0000">SQRT</font></code> and <font color="#ff0000"><code>#LSQRT</code></font>
      code sections, so that they are in a fixed relationship to each
      other, and in particular there is really no separate <font
        color="#ff0000"><code>#LSQRT</code></font> section as such in
      the object file output by the assembler.&nbsp; I.e., <font
        color="#ff0000"><code>#LSQRT</code></font> has become just a
      label for an address within the <code><font color="#ff0000">SQRT</font></code>
      section, and the actual linker program <i>cannot</i> change this
      at any later time.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="unknownDatatype"></a>Non-System/360 Datatype 0x84<br>
    </h2>
    <p>To understand the comments below, it may help to refer back to <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="#exampleReverseEngineering">the
        earlier example of a reverse-engineering report</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In so-called SYM records within an object file, each symbol
      representing "data" has an associated "datatype", consisting of a
      single-byte number.&nbsp; For example, the datatype 0x00
      represents character data (C), 0x04 represents hexadecimal data
      (X), 0x18 represents single-precision floating-point (E), and so
      on.&nbsp; However, there's one datatype in AP-101S object files,
      0x84, that doesn't appear in the available system/360 object-file
      documentation, leading us to speculate that it represents some
      AP-101S-only datatype not available on System/360.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>As it happens, there's <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="ASM101S.html#literals">discussion on our page about the
        modern AP-101 assembler that concerns the available datatypes</a>.&nbsp;

      That discussion points out a single AP-101S-specific datatype, Z,
      that's speculated to be <i>unrelated</i> to the System/360
      datatype also designated as Z ("zoned decimal", 0x34).&nbsp; For
      AP-101S, it was speculated that the Z datatype instead was
      something called a ZCON, which as kind of long-range address
      constant for items not present in nearby memory and hence
      addressable by only a restricted class of instructions.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>We are thus tempted to equate datatype 0x84 in SYM records with
      AP-101S ZCONs.&nbsp; At the moment this is pure speculation that
      perhaps doesn't fit perfectly, but the reverse-engineering report
      nevertheless treats it as factual and reacts to these datatypes as
      follows:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>0x34 (System/360 zoned decimal) would be displayed in the
        reports as "z", but cannot actually appear.<br>
      </li>
      <li>0x84 (<i>possibly</i> AP-101S ZCON) is displayed in the
        reports as "Z".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="characterEncoding"></a>Encoding of Character Data in
      Object Decks<br>
    </h2>
    <p>In System/360 object files, all character data is encoded in
      EBCDIC.&nbsp; This is not true for AP-101 object files. <i>Some</i>
      text is encoded instead in the character set of the Space
      Shuttle's Display Electronics Unit (DEU).<br>
    </p>
    The DEU character set is depicted in the table below.&nbsp; It is an
    ASCII-like character set, in the sense that almost everywhere the
    printable characters or control codes overlap with printable ASCII
    characters or control codes, the numerical encoding matches ASCII as
    well. <br>
    <p align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="encodingDEU.png"
        alt="" width="638" height="468" align="top"></p>
    Reverse engineering reveals at least some of the cases in which DEU
    encoding is used in place of EBCDIC in the object files:<br>

    You can verify for yourself, if you like, that the colored portions
    are encoded as DEU/ASCII, and hopefully take my word for it (since I
    wrote it!) that the reverse-engineering report generator uses
    EBCDIC-to-ASCII conversion to print out messages such as <code>ident="I**20021"</code>.<br>
    <blockquote><b><font size="-1">Aside:</font></b><font size="-1">&nbsp;



        There's no easy way, as far as I know, using just information
        within the object decks themselves, to easily locate individual
        unnamed string literals within the TXT records of the object
        decks.&nbsp; The way I did it above, was to <i>assume</i> that
        ASCII coding was used, and to look for the ASCII strings ...
        which I admit was a bit of a cheat, even though it doesn't
        invalidate the conclusions in any way.&nbsp; In the next
        section, we'll learn enough to infer that the these strings <i>should</i>
        have been found in a <code>CSECT</code> called <code>#DROOTS</code>.&nbsp;



        And in portions of the reverse-engineering report that I've
        omitted above, we would have seen that there is in fact a </font><font
        size="-1"><font size="-1"><code>CSECT</code></font> called </font><font
        size="-1"><font size="-1"><code>#DROOTS</code></font> and that
        it is assigned the ESDID 0003, which is the case in the excerpt
        above.&nbsp; So indeed, everything is as it should be in this
        the best of all possible worlds.</font><br>

    <h2><a name="program"></a>PROGRAM Compilation Units</h2>
    Object files generated from HAL/S source code containing a <code>PROGRAM</code>
    (i.e., the top-level compilation unit of a program, rather than a
    mere component of a program such as the <code>PROCEDURE</code>)
    have object files differing from the format described in the
    System/360 documentation and roughly covered in examples of reverse
    engineering above.<br>
    <p>Such an object file <i>begins</i> with a block of records in the
      almost-System/360 format we've already described, but differs
      after an END record is encountered.&nbsp; After an END record, we
      enter undocumented <i>terra incognita</i>, in which we can only
      rely upon whatever reverse engineering we can apply.<br>

    <p>After compiling this file and parsing the object file, we find

      <p><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Strictly speaking, this
          isn't an ASCII translation of the extraneous data, because it
          has a few flourishes of my own to make it more readable.&nbsp;
          Specifically, the enclosing quotes are mine, the non-printable
          control characters encoded numerically as 0x00 (NUL), 0x01
          (SOH), and 0x02 (STX) are represented by the lower-case
          characters "a", "b", and "c", respectively, and there aren't
          actually any newlines.&nbsp; But we can get the gist of it!</font><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We need to digress for a moment before trying to make some sense
      of this extraneous nonsense.&nbsp; In the earlier discussion of
      the object-file format, I glossed over certain simple facts that I
      assumed you could glean from the System/360 documentation if you
      were actually interested.&nbsp; But those facts become relevant to
      the discussion now, so let state them:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An object file is supposed to consist entirely of 80-byte
        records.</li>
      <li>The first byte of each record is supposed to be the control
        character STX, i.e. 0x02 (or "c" in the representation above).</li>
      <li>Records appear in the order of type SYM, type ESD, type TXT,
        type RLD, and type END.</li>
      <li>The final 8 characters of each record have an undefined
        purpose, but traditionally are an "ident" string that increments
        with each line.&nbsp; Note that in the example above I haven't
        shown the records preceding the extraneous material, but those
        omitted records have ident fields "I**2001" for the leading SYM
        record through "I**2017" at the END record.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So superficially at least, the extraneous material at the end of
      the object file starts with an aberrant record that is neither 80
      bytes in length nor begins with 0x02.&nbsp; But after that
      aberrant record, the remaining extraneous material seems to follow
      the rules as if they comprised a completely separate object file.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Taking all of that into account, here's the kind of
      reverse-engineering report we actually see.&nbsp; The extraneous
      material is highlighted in green, and I've invented a new record
      type (HDR, for "header") for what I've so far been calling the
      "aberrant" record:<br>
